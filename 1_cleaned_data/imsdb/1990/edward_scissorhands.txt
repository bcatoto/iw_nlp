OLD KIM	m	Snuggle in, sweetie. It's cold out there. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	Why is it snowing, grandma? Where does it come  from? 
OLD KIM	m	Oh, that's a long story, sweetheart. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	I want to hear. 
OLD KIM	m	Oh, not tonight. Go to sleep. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	I'm not sleepy. Tell me, please. 
OLD KIM	m	Well, all right. Let's see. I guess it would  have to start with scissors. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	Scissors? 
OLD KIM	m	Well, there are all kinds of scissors. And once  there was even a man who had scissors for  hands. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	A man? 
OLD KIM	m	Yes. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	Hands, scissors? 
OLD KIM	m	No, scissorhands. You know the mansion on top  of the mountain? 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	It's haunted. 
OLD KIM	m	Well, a long time ago, an inventor lived in  that mansion. He made many things, I suppose.  He also created a man. He gave him inside, a  heart, a brain, everything. Well, almost  everything. You see, the inventor was very old.  He died before he got to finish the man he  invented. So the man was left by himself,  incomplete and all alone. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	He didn't have a name? 
OLD KIM	m	Of course, he had a name. His name was Edward. 
PEG	f	Avon calling. 
HELEN	f	Weren't you just here? 
PEG	f	No, not since last season. Today I've come to  show you our exquisite new line of soft colors  in shadows, blushes and lipstick. Everything  you need to accent and highlight your changing  looks. 
HELEN	f	My changing looks? That's good. 
PEG	f	Well, it goes that saying and I also have a  complete selection of your old favorites, those  tried-and-true products we've all come to  depend on year-in and year-out. 
HELEN	f	Come on, Peg. I never buy anything from you.  You know that? 
PEG	f	I know. Bye, Helen. 
REPAIRMAN	m	You know, you didn't have to call me, ma'am.  You could have taken care of this by yourself. 
JOYCE	f	I could? I don't think so. 
REPAIRMAN	m	Yeah, you see, it's easy. The food trap's  clogged. That's all. You see this bolt here?  You just unscrew this. OK? And out she pops. 
JOYCE	f	You know, on TV they say you repairmen are  lonely bunch of people. Housewives get lonely  too. Although you may not realize it since they  haven't made a commercial on the subject. 
REPAIRMAN	m	And then you just take this and put it back in  here nice and easy. Be careful not to force it,  because it fits in there by itself. And then  you just screw this back on. 
JOYCE	f	On no! Who could that be? Will you excuse me  for a moment? Now. Don't go anywhere. I'll be  right back. This is fascinating. I wouldn't  want to miss a moment of it. 
PEG	f	Good morning, Joyce. Avon calling. 
JOYCE	f	Why! Peg. Have you gone blind? Can't you see  there's a vehicle in my driveway? 
PEG	f	Oh, yes. 
JOYCE	f	Well, I'm surprised you don't realize that  means I'm busy.  
PEG	f	Okay. Now, we should decide on lipsticks. Okay,  dear, what one did you like best? There was the  Winsome Wahini which looked charming on you. Or  the Bahenie Bliss. 
A GIRL	f	I like them both. 
PEG	f	Well, great. 
A GIRL	f	You don't actually think I have any money, do  you? 
CHILDREN	?	Ding, dong, the Avon lady. 
PEG	f	It's just not my day. 
PEG	f	Oh, my goodness. 
PEG	f	Oh, it's so beautiful. Hello? Hello? Avon calling, oh my. Hello, I'm Peg  Boggs. I'm your local Avon representative.  Hello. I'm sorry to barge in like this. But you  don't have any reason to be afraid. This is  some huge house, isn't it? Thank goodness for  those aerobics classes. 
PEG	f	Hello. Hello. Why are you hiding back there?  You don't have to hide from me. I'm Peg Boggs.  I'm your local Avon representative and I'm as  harmless as cherry pie.  Oh my! I can see that I've disturbed you. How  stupid of me! I'll just be going now. 
EDWARD	m	Don't go. 
PEG	f	Oh my! What happened to you? 
EDWARD	m	I'm not finished. 
PEG	f	Uh, put those down. Don't come any closer. Just  please... Those are your hands? Those are your  hands. What happened to you? Where are your  parents? Hum... Your mother? Your father? 
EDWARD	m	He didn't wake up. 
PEG	f	Are you alone? Do you live up here all by  yourself? What happened to your face? Hum, you  know, I won't hurt you. But at the very least  let me give you a good astringent and this will  help to prevent infection. What's your name? 
EDWARD	m	Edward. 
PEG	f	Edward? I think you should just come home with  me. 
PEG	f	Oh! 
EDWARD	m	I'm-I'm sorry. 
PEG	f	No, Don't be. You go ahead and look you have  every reason to be excited. 
PEG	f	Oh! Are you ok? 
EDWARD	m	Are you ok? 
HELEN	f	Hello. 
MARGIE	f	Hi, it's Margie. Listen, I was standing outside  talking to Carol and Peg drove by, she had  somebody in the car. 
HELEN	f	Did you get a good look? 
MARGIE	f	No, did she say anything to you, about having  guest? 
HELEN	f	She didn't say anything. She rang my doorbell  early this morning. 
MARGIE	f	No, ok, I'll meet you on the corner. Right,  Bye. 
HELEN	f	Oh, damn! 
PEG	f	Here we go, dear. This is our house. And you  can just go right in and make yourself right at  home. OK? And just, well have something to eat  or drink, whatever you... Here, dear. Here  you... This is the front door here, Here we go,  right in here. 
A WOMAN	f	Joyce, I just saw this strange guy drop in with  Peg. I didn't get a very good look at him. He  looked kind of pale. Okay, I'll be right there.  Don't do anything without me. Okay? Bye. 
JOYCE	f	Yes, I'll be right there. 
PEG	f	Here we are. So, oh, this is the living room  and back here, the bedrooms. You want to see  the pictures? All right. Well, this is my  husband, Bill. He's a bowling champion. Do you  know what bowling is? Bowling? Well, here they  are down at the lake, fishing. I think Kevin  looks a little glum Because they didn't catch  anything that day. And here's my daughter, Kim.  All dressed up the junior prom. She's a senior  now. I can't believe it. She's camping in the  mountains with some friends, but she'll be back  in a few days and you can meet her then. Isn't  she beautiful? That's my family. Now, go on,  dear. I'll show you the rest of the house. Then  you can just freshen up and make yourself at  home. Okay? That's the kitchen over there. You  help yourself to anything you want to eat or  drink. Those are grapes. Back here are the  bedrooms. Let me get you some towels, then I  will see what we can find to wear. You know  what? I think I have some of Bill's old clothes  in here. This is perfect. Here. These should  just fit you.  Oh, no, no. Don't be alarmed. That's just a  phone. Now you can go in Kim's room and put  these on. I'll be right with you. 
PEG	f	No, no, scissors. That's right. Well, he was  born up there or something. Have you seen him  before? No, I don't think he's been off the  grounds before today. You're kidding. How did  you get together with him? I have to go. I'll  talk to you later Margie, Bye-bye. I'm sorry Edward, I didn't... oh, dear. May I  help you with this? 
EDWARD	m	Thank you. 
PEG	f	There you go. Oh, dear, you've cut your face.  Let me get this right off. Does that hurt?  Okay. No, good. Now let's get you dressed.  Okay. There we go. Very fine. You look fine,  just fine. Come on, we can't wait for you.  You've got rollers in your damn hair. 
PEG	f	Okay. Now what did I do with my sci... Edward,  um, would you. Thank you. I have a doctor  friend who I think could help you. 
EDWARD	m	Really? 
PEG	f	Yes, I can help with the scars. I just want to  consult the Avon handbook before doing  anything. 
PEG	f	Kevin, it's not polite to stare. Think how it  would make you feel if somebody were staring at  you. 
KEVIN	m	I wouldn't care. 
PEG	f	Well, I would, so don't do it! 
BILL	m	This must be quite a change for you, Ed. 
PEG	f	I think he prefers Edward. 
BILL	m	Sure. So what have you been doing up there in  that big old place? I bet the view must be  spectacular, Ed. 
PEG	f	I was just... 
BILL	m	See all the way to the ocean? 
EDWARD	m	Sometimes. 
PEG	f	Bill, could I have the salt and pepper? Thank  you. 
KEVIN	m	Man, those things are cool. You know I bet  they're razor sharp. One karate chop to a guy's  neck... 
PEG	f	Would you like some butter for your bread? 
PEG	f	Great. 
EDWARD	m	Thank you. 
KEVIN	m	Can I bring him to show and tell on Monday? 
PEG	f	I've had enough. 
PEG	f	You think you can sleep? Things feel strange  now, but soon you'll feel right at home. Good  night. 
PEG	f	The light concealing cream goes on first, then  you blend and blend and blend. Blending is the  secret. More concealing for you? But you  complexion is so fair. Now this has a touch of  lavender in it. Give it a try here. Close  enough. OK. This should do the trick here. I  have another idea. We'll cover up the scars and  start with a completely smooth surface. Don't  eat this stuff!  Sports announcements on  
RADIO	m	Hartely into the windup and the strike one  pitch. Swung on and missed strike two. If it's  a hit, the club has 12 hits. But they still  have 11 on the scoreboard and it's 3-1. 0 and 2  the count to Warren. Now they change it to 12  hits. 
BILL	m	Turn it up, Kevin. I can't hear it. Kevin! No,  make it louder. Sports announcements on  
RADIO	m	Hartely's strike two pitch is hammered. 
KEVIN	m	You hear that, Mr. Boggs? 
BILL	m	No, make it louder.  Sports announcements on  
RADIO	m	It's going way back. It's gone. It's out of  here. It is history. 
KEVIN	m	Dad, look!  Sports announcements on  
RADIO	m	A grand slam for Martinez to make it a five-run  inning and blow this game to pieces. 
BILL	m	I'll be darned. 
PEG	f	They filled the whole tape. 
RECORDED VOICES	m	What's going on over there, Peg. Call me....Hi,  it's Margie. Who is he? Call me. Oh, by the  way, here it's pouring rain in the mountains.  You think the kids are okay?...Hi, there,  darling. The gals are all in a tizzy about your  secret visitor. You can't keep him a secret  forever. 
BILL	m	Boy, it's just wonderful, Ed. My god, you, you  have the whole family in there, don't you? 
KEVIN	m	Edward, come here. 
BILL	m	No, no, no. That's a terrible idea, son. Go to  the garage and get the oil can. We don't want  him rusting up on this now, do we? 
PEG	f	Edward, you did us? Oh, Bill. It's us. 
BILL	m	Yes, it is. 
PEG	f	Oh, Edward. 
ESMERALDA	f	It's not heaven he's from. It's straight from  the stinking flames of hell. The power of satan  is in him. I can feel it. God, you have the  poor sheep strayed so far from the path. 
EDWARD	m	We are not sheep. 
ESMERALDA	f	Don't come near me. 
BILL	m	That's right. Go on. Get out of here. Run! 
PEG	f	Edward, don't you listen to her. 
BILL	m	Don't worry about her, Edward. She's just an  old lonely loony. That's all. 
WOMEN	f	Hi! 
JOYCE	f	You are all hiding in there like a bunch of old  hermit crabs. 
PEG	f	Hi, Joyce. Hi! 
JOYCE	f	Shame on you, keeping your unusual guest all to  yourself. We think that's mighty selfish of  you. 
PEG	f	No, it, it's... things have just been a little  hectic around here. That's all. 
JOYCE	f	Oh, that was so sweet of you to want to correct  the situation. What time does the barbecue  begin? 
PEG	f	Barbecue? 
JOYCE	f	Well, you intend to show your guest hospitality  by introducing him to your friends, don't you? 
ANOTHER WOMAN	f	I'll bring coleslaw. 
JOYCE	f	And I will bring the ambrosia salad. What time  was it that you said? 
PEG	f	What time? Ah... bill. 
JOYCE	f	About five? 
ESMERALDA	f	He has been sent first to tempt you. But it's  not too late. You must push him from you. Expel  him. Trample down the perversion of nature. 
JOYCE	f	Did you hear that? He's the perversion of  nature. Wow, isn't that exciting? See you  later. Bye bye. 
PEG	f	I've always said that you really can't have a  picnic or a barbecue without deviled eggs.  They're just the best. They make the thing. Oh,  dear. Edward. That's wonderful. I didn't know  you chopped all those things. What a really  big... Oh, all right now. It's just a nick. There's no  need to be nervous, dear. You know, Esmeralda  won't be here and the rest of neighbors there  are really very nice. There's no need to be  nervous. They are so eager to meet you. You  just have to be yourself. 
EDWARD	m	Myself? 
PEG	f	That's right. Just your own sweet self. 
KEVIN	m	Hey, play scissors, paper, stone with us. 
EDWARD	m	Play scissors what? 
NEIGHBOR	m	I got a doctor friend might be able to help  you. Aren't they most incredible? 
PEG	f	He did them just like that. 
TINKA	f	This afternoon? 
AT THE PARTY	m	Hi, Mike. How are you doing? Hello, Jack. Hey,  kid. Hey, Hi. George Morroe! Whoa! That's a  heck of handshake. Uh, Harry! Harry! I saw you  on the golf course. You got a dozen of the  melons... 
PEG	f	Are you ok?  Do you want something to eat?  Are  you hungry? Do you want a cracker? 
MARGIE	f	He's so... different completely different, No  kidding mysterious. 
JOYCE	f	Do you imagine those hands are hot or cold?  Just think what a single snip could do. 
HELEN	f	Or undo. 
GEORGE	m	Eddie.  The guys and I were talking, we'd like  want to invite you to our card game on Friday  night. Would you like that? Only thing is, you  can't cut. 
AN OLD MAN	m	I have my own infirmity. Never did me a bit of  harm. Took some shrapnel during the war and  ever since then I can't feel a thing. Not a  damn thing. Listen Don't you ever let anybody  tell you you have a handicap. 
JOYCE	f	Who's handicapped? My goodness! Don't be  ridiculous. You're not handicapped. You're...  What do they call that? Exceptional. My name's  Joyce. And I noticed that you have not tasted  any of the ambrosia salad that I made  especially for you. Allow me.  
WOMAN 1	f	You must try this. 
MARGE	f	You must try this.  It's my mother's recipe.  Let him chew, for heaven sakes with your green  thumb. I could use your help. 
HOUSEWIFE	f	Me, too. There you go. 
WOMAN 2	f	I want a row of angels. 
JOYCE	f	Sorry, ladies. But he's promised to come to my  house first. 
WOMAN 3	f	One more. 
JOYCE	f	Haven't you, Eddie? 
EDWARD	m	I did? 
BILL	m	Okay, everybody. Grab your plates. Soup's on. 
EDWARD	m	I thought it was shish kebab. 
BILL	m	What? 
EDWARD	m	I thought it was shish kebab. 
BILL	m	Yeah, it, it is shish kebab. It was a figure of  speech, Ed. You got to learn not to take things  so literally. 
INVENTOR	m	Let us pretend we're in the drawing room, and  the hostess is serving tea "Now, many numerous  little questions confront us" "Should the man  rise" "When he accepts his cup of tea?" "May  lump sugar be taken with the things?" 
EDWARD	m	Hmm, no. 
INVENTOR	m	Is it good form to accept a second cup? "Now,  should the napkin be entirely unfolded." Oh  should the center crease. Be allowed to remain?  It is so easy to commit embarrassing  blunders. "But etiquette humiliation and discomfort. Mmm yes, boring. Let us switch to,  Um... To some poetry, Hmm?" "There was an old  man from the cape." "Who made himself there,  but they keep such a beautiful shape." That's  right. Go ahead, smile. It's funny. That's  right. 
DENNY	m	Okay, guys, we're home. shh. 
KIM	?	I can't believe. Everything's still sopping. 
TEENAGE GIRL	f	I can't wait to take a shower. 
SUZANNE	f	And wash off the mildew. 
JIM	m	If my parents set the alarm, I'm screwed I'll  sleep in the yard... again. 
KIM	?	I told you to call to say we're coming back  early. 
DENNY	m	Did you? 
SUZANNE	f	He'd rather complain. 
JIM	m	How else can I be the center of the attention?  You didn't call your parents. 
KIM	?	They don't run their house like a police  station. Bye. Thanks for driving, Denny. See  you later. 
JIM	m	See you later. Bye. 
KIM	?	Don't forget your arm. 
JIM	m	Oh, yeah. 
DENNY	m	Come on, Jim let's go. 
KIM	?	Bill! There's somebody in my room. Go. Look. A  murderer with an axe. He did try to even kill  me. 
BILL	m	It's all right. It's all right.  Go back to bed. It's only Edward. This way. 
PEG	f	Honey, that was Edward. 
KIM	?	Who is he? What are you talking about? 
PEG	f	Edward's come to live with us. There's nothing  to be upset about. No, no. It's okay. 
BILL	m	We'll have you a setup here in a minute. Up  with your feet. A queen-size bed here. How do  you like that? It's all made up and everything.  There you go. What's the matter? What's wrong?  She gets you nervous? You've been closed up in  a way in that castle too long.  You don't know  anything about the wonderful world of teen-age  girls. They're all crazy. Here some. Straighten  that out. 
EDWARD	m	What is it? 
BILL	m	Lemonade. I don't know what it is. They reach a  certain age. They develop these gland things.  Their bodies swell up. They go crazy. 
EDWARD	m	Glands? 
BILL	m	yeah, glands. I try not to think about it Good. Isn't it? 
PEG	f	Now you stay in Kevin's room tonight. Tomorrow  we'll fix your room right. 
KIM	?	Mom, why did you have to bring him in here? 
PEG	f	Oh, honey, I couldn't have left him there all  alone. You would have done the same thing. 
KIM	?	Why does he have to stay here? 
PEG	f	Oh, my goodness, Kim. I'm surprised at you. He  can't help the way he is. Have a little  sympathy. 
KIM	?	I do have a little sympathy. 
PEG	f	Then let's just say hello and later you can  come downstairs and shake his hand. 
KIM	?	Shake his hand? 
PEG	f	Well, not literally. Goodness, you scared him  half to death. 
KIM	?	I scared him to death? 
PEG	f	Hi, Bill. I just wanted you two to have a  proper introduction. Edward, this is our  daughter Kim.  Kim, this is Edward who's going  to live with us. 
KIM	?	Hi!  
JOYCE	f	Eddie. Thirsty?  Kisses, Hush up. Quiet now. I can hardly hear  myself think. Momma's precious little baby  girl. Wouldn't you like a nice cool glass of  lemonade? 
EDWARD	m	Lemonade? 
KEVIN	m	One chop to guy's neck. And it's all over.  They're the sharpest things in the world. They  can hack through anything. And... 
KIM	?	I think they look weird. They give me the  creeps. 
A GIRL	f	You should see the clown in front of Ms.  Peter's yard. 
EDWARD	m	Kim! 
KIM	?	Oh, no! 
A GIRL	f	That's him? 
JIM	m	He's calling you, Kim. 
KIM	?	Stop it. 
A WOMAN	f	Edward, you forgot your cookies. 
JIM	m	Don't worry, Eddie. She's waiting for you. 
A GIRL	f	Let's go. 
PEG	f	Bill, you know what Edward told me? He had  lunch at Jackie's today. 
BILL	m	Really? 
PEG	f	She's just had her kitchen completely redone. 
BILL	m	I'll be darned. 
PEG	f	New paint, new cabinets, new floors, new  microwave, new Sonnet dishwasher. 
BILL	m	Yeah, isn't that wonderful? 
PEG	f	Isn't that something? Jim, didn't you tell me  your mom had her kitchen done too? 
JIM	m	Yeah, my dad bought himself a bunch of new  toys. Big screen TV, CD players, VCR with four  heads. 
PEG	f	My goodness sake! I wonder what it's like to be  that rich. 
JIM	m	No, they keep things pretty much locked up. My  father has his own room for his stuff to make  sure I can't get and use it. He's so cheap he  won't help me buy my own car. 
BILL	m	Well, he probably wants you to pay for it  yourself. I agree with him. It builds  character. You'll appreciate it more. Speaking  of money, I understand you are not charging for  gardening, Edward? 
PEG	f	Now, Bill. Margie made him cookies today. 
BILL	m	Sweetheart, you can't buy the necessities of  life with cookies. You can't buy car with  cookies. Am I right, Jim? 
JIM	m	Ah, that's true, sir. You can't. 
A GIRL	f	I can't eat that. He used his hands. I don't  think it's sanitary. 
EDWARD	m	I'm sorry. 
PEG	f	Honey, you want me to help you clean that up? 
KIM	?	No, that's okay. I'll be right back.  
HOUSEWIFE	f	This can't possibly be my Alexis. She looks so beautiful. Look at you. She's  gorgeous. Thank you. 
PEG	f	It won't be long. She has just to decide on the  style, and then it will be fine. She just has  to decide what style she wants. 
JOYCE	f	I was hoping for something big and bouffant.  Kind of like mine. Don't you worry , Kisses.  You'll be so pretty. Eddie, is there anything  you can't do? You take my breath away. I swear.  Look at this. Have you ever cut a woman's hair?  Would you cut mine? That was the single most  thrilling experience of my whole life. 
PEG	f	We're getting the head of the company. 
KIM	?	I'm home. 
PEG	f	Hi, honey. We're in here. 
KIM	?	Hi! What did you do to your hair? 
PEG	f	Edward cut it. Isn't it wild?  Hello. Oh, I can't believe I'm talking to you  in person. This is such an honor. Yes. He's  right here. Great. So then you know all about  it. Aha. That's exactly what I've been using.  Well, I've had a little trouble getting it to  the right consistency. Yeah, right. just a  little. I'll try that. Well, what imaginative  suggestions! I sure will. Thank you so much.  Bye bye. No wonder she's the head of the company. You  know, she started out as a sales representative  just like me. I've always wanted to talk to her  but until now I never had a reason. Thanks,  Edward. 
EDWARD	m	She had some ideas? 
PEG	f	You bet she did. 
MARGIE	f	I'll get that. 
MARGIE	f	Edward! We're here. Come on. Let's get you  sharpened up. 
JIM	m	You got it? 
KIM	?	No, I can't believe this.  Do you have a key? 
EDWARD	m	No. 
KIM	?	I could have sworn I put it in here somewhere. 
JIM	m	Well, we're stranded.  
KIM	?	Wow! Thanks. 
JIM	m	Ed, what a guy! Good job. Hey, you didn't break  it or scratch it or anything. Hey, be a pal and  yell when Peg pulls in, huh? 
TV HOST	m	Quite a story, yes? Any questions for Edward?  Yeah, get way over. Stand right up. 
WOMAN 1	f	What's been the best part of your new life here  in town? 
EDWARD	m	The friends I've made. 
TV HOST	m	Any other questions? 
WOMAN 2	f	Have you ever thought of having corrective  surgery or prosthetics? I know a doctor that  might be able to help you. 
EDWARD	m	I'd like to meet him. 
TV HOST	m	We'll give that name after the show. Thank you  very much. That's very nice. Anyone else? Yes,  stand right up. 
WOMAN 3	f	But if you had regular hands you'd be like  everyone else. 
EDWARD	m	Yes, I know. 
TV HOST	m	I think he'd like that. 
WOMAN 4	f	Then no one would think you're special. You  wouldn't be on TV or anything. 
PEG	f	No matter what, Edward will always special. 
TV HOST	m	More questions? Stand right up. 
WOMAN 5	f	Your work is so interesting distinctive and  unique. Do you have plans to open your own  beauty salon? 
TV HOST	m	There's an idea. Anyone else? Yeah. 
WOMAN 6	f	Do you have a girl friend? Ahh. 
JIM	m	Sure, he does. Right, Kim? 
KIM	?	Now you got him started. 
JIM	m	Knock it off, bubble- butt. 
KEVIN	m	You did it. 
JIM	m	So? 
TV HOST	m	How about it? Is there some special lady in  your life? 
TV HOST	m	Uh, everything's all right. He'll take a break  and we'll be right back after these messages. 
KIM	?	Why are you laughing? He got hurt. 
JIM	m	It was a little shock. Ha! Ha! Ha! 
KIM	?	A little shock? 
JIM	m	I wish we'd been taping that. I'd give my left  nut to see that again. 
JOYCE	f	Aren't you excited? Oh, this is just so  thrilling. Wait till I show it to you. It's  just perfect. It's just what we've been looking  for. I want to call it "Shear Heaven." Here we  are. No, all along here I'm going to put a row  of new mirrors. Back up here a whole row of new  cosmetics. 
EDWARD	m	Peg could sell cosmetics. 
JOYCE	f	Sure. This is where I stand when I greet the  customers. Back in here is what I really want  to show you. This is the storeroom for  supplies. What I need from you today is to help  me make a decision. Don't, that's dangerous.  You just sit down right there. I have some  smocks. Would you like me to model them? This  is my favorite because it's yellow. And what  it's for is to catch itchy little trimming that  fall down your neck. Then there's this old  purple one, you know, you kind of drape around  you like this. 
EDWARD	m	I like that one. 
JOYCE	f	You're trembling. So am I. I've been waiting  for this moment for so long. Edward! Edward,  you come back here! You can't do that! 
BILL	m	Veloro. Veloro. Sweetheart. That hangs on the  dash board. 
PEG	f	I've never seen that. 
EDWARD	m	Sorry I'm late. 
PEG	f	Hi, Edward. Sorry. We had to go ahead without  you. Here you go. 
BILL	m	So, Edward, did you have a productive day? 
EDWARD	m	Mrs. Monroe showed me where the salon is going  to be. You could have a cosmetic counter. 
PEG	f	Wouldn't that be great? 
BILL	m	Great. 
EDWARD	m	And then she showed me the back room where she  took all of her clothes off. 
BILL	m	Edward. I can't tell you how thrilled I am.   I'm just as pleased as Punch. This whole beauty  parlor, that's what's going to teach you  volumes. There's nothing like running your own  business. I've never done it myself, but from  what I gather it's the greatest satisfaction a  working man can have. So I guess the bank is  going to be your next step, huh? 
EDWARD	m	The bank? 
BILL	m	Yeah, take out a loan. Get yourself started.  Nothing to worry about. With your talent and  reputation, it's going to be a snap. Now. 
BANK CLERK	m	No credit, no record of jobs you've held, no  savings, no personal investment, no social  security number. You may as well not even  exist. There is no collateral. 
PEG	f	You know. We already have a second on the  house, but don't the testimonials make a  difference?  Did you see here, the mayor's wife  can't wait to become a client? 
BANK CLERK	m	We simply can't do it. Now get yourself a  social security card. Establish credit and buy  yourself a car. You have the side to advantage.  You can get one of those handicapped placards.  No problem. Park anywhere you like. 
PEG	f	I can't believe it. Really, it's just an  outrage. Don't you worry. This isn't the end of  it. We'll get your money somewhere. 
KIM	?	But that's breaking and entering. 
JIM	m	Look. My parents have insurance up the rear.  Okay? And all it will cost them is a little  hassle. That's about it. In a week my dad will  have new and better everything. 
KIM	?	We can't. 
JIM	m	Look. There's a guy who will give us cash for  the stuff. 
KIM	?	Jim, I don't want to. 
JIM	m	Well, do you want to ride around in a van like  Denny's, and we could be by ourselves whenever  we like? With a mattress in the back? 
KIM	?	Why can't you just do it? 
JIM	m	Because my father keeps the damn room locked,  and we need Edward to get us in. 
KIM	?	Why can't you take the key like when he's  sleeping or something? 
JIM	m	Look, you don't understand, everything he  handcuffs or ties will do anything for you. 
KIM	?	What do you mean?  That's not true. 
JIM	m	Oh, no? Why don't you ask him? 
KIM	?	That's not fair. 
JIM	m	What's fair got to do with it? There isn't any  other way. 
KIM	?	There got to be. 
JIM	m	Look. I've racked my brain. Don't you want us  to have our own van? 
KIM	?	Yeah.  Jim, the lights are on. 
JIM	m	Those go on automatically. They've gone for the  weekend. I told you. That's right. 
DENNY	m	This burglar scared. 
KIM	?	You turned off the alarm. Am I right? 
JIM	m	Yes, everything, come on. Let's go. Come on. 
KIM	?	I can't believe this is happening. 
A GIRL	f	Are you sure he doesn't know this is Jim's  house? 
KIM	?	He's never been here. 
EDWARD	m	This person stole from you? 
JIM	m	Keep your voice down. I told you he stole it.  Right? Come on. Let's go. 
EDWARD	m	His parents will make him give it back. 
JIM	m	Listen, I've already tried that. The guy's  parents are like he is. Okay? Now, you told Kim  you'd do this. Well, come on. Let's go. Come  on. Come on. Come on. 
JIM	m	The bastard had it wired separately. Come on. 
KIM	?	No, Jim. We can't just leave him here. 
POLICEMAN	m	We know you're in there. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	We're in the process of deactivating the system  so that you can come out. 
KIM	?	Denny, turn around! 
JIM	m	No way! 
KIM	?	Jim, it's your house. They can't arrest you for  setting off your own alarm. We'll just tell  them we were breaking in. 
JIM	m	I'm not going back there. Okay? 
KIM	?	We have to go back. 
JIM	m	No, because my father will prosecute. 
KIM	?	His own son? 
JIM	m	Especially his own son. If Edward tells, I'll  kill him. 
KIM	?	Denny, turn around. 
JIM	m	No. 
KIM	?	Turn around. We have to. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Put your hands high in the air so we can see  them. Put your hands up! 
POLICEMAN	m	He's got something in his hands. Looks like  knives. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Drop your weapon I repeat. Drop your weapon.  I'll ask you one more time and this is your  last warning. Drop your weapon. If you fail to  do so, we'll have to open fire. Don't make us  do that, please. Drop your weapons. Drop them.  Now. Looks like we got a psycho. Prepare to  fire.  
A WOMAN	f	Please. We know him. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Alright, cuff him. 
PEG	f	But can we see him now? 
POLICEMAN	m	We'll have to hold him overnight for  observation. 
PEG	f	He has to stay in prison all night? 
POLICEMAN	m	Pick him up in the morning. 
PEG	f	Oh, Edward. Hello Edward, dear. I blame myself. 
BILL	m	What in god's name was going through your mind,  son? 
PEG	f	Why don't I set a better example? You saw how I  envied Jim's parents, their money. 
BILL	m	What were you going to do with that stuff? 
PEG	f	Oh, I blithely say, "We'll get money for the  salon somehow." But I never meant stealing.  Stealing's not the way to get it. Stealing's  not the way to get anything. 
BILL	m	Except trouble. And you're in a heap of that. 
PEG	f	Why ever did you do this? 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Will he be okay, Doc? 
PSYCHOLOGIST	m	The years in spent isolation have not equipped  him with the tools necessary to judge right  from wrong. He's had no context. He's been  completely without guidance. Furthermore his  work, the garden sculptures, hair styles, and  so forth. Indicate that he's a highly  imaginative. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Character. 
PSYCHOLOGIST	m	It seems clear that his awareness of what we  call reality is radically underdeveloped. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	But will he be all right out there? 
PSYCHOLOGIST	m	Oh, yeah. He'll be fine. 
OFFICER ALLEN	m	Listen. It could keep me up all night worrying  about you. Watch yourself. 
MARGIE	f	I heard this noise and ran out in my bathrobe. 
JOYCE	f	All along I felt in my gut. There was something  wrong with him. 
MARGIE	f	It could have been my house. 
HELEN	f	It could have been any of our houses. 
ESMERALDA	f	I warned you, didn't I? I saw the sign of satan  on him.  You didn't heed my warning. but now  you will because now you see it too. 
PEG	f	Edward. You stay here. 
REPORTER	m	What do you say in your defense? 
EDWARD	m	Nothing. 
PEG	f	He didn't want to talk. 
REPORTER	m	You have to say something. 
PEG	f	He can't talk right now. 
REPORTER	m	No comments? No remarks? 
REPORTER	m	So were you set up? What was going through your  mind? One comment. 
PEG	f	We have to get in the house. We don't want to  talk to you. We'll talk to you later. 
REPORTER	m	One comment. 
PEG	f	Well, for goodness sakes, Lois, I'll see you at  our Christmas party. Before I get you here for  your haircut. Of course, we'll have it this  year. Why wouldn't we have it this year? Well,  you may think that, but you're wrong. 
KIM	?	You're here. They didn't hurt you, did they?  Were you scared? I tried to make Jim go back,  but you can't make Jim do anything. Thank you  for not telling them about me. 
EDWARD	m	You are welcome. 
KIM	?	It must have been awful when they told you  whose house it was. 
EDWARD	m	I know it was Jim's house. 
KIM	?	You did? 
EDWARD	m	Yes. 
KIM	?	Well, then why did you do it? 
EDWARD	m	Because you asked me to. 
KIM	?	Don't. 
JIM	m	What's the matter with you? When you are going  to stop? I did what I could. My old man think  he's retarded, otherwise he'd still be in jail.  What more do you want from me? 
KIM	?	You could tell the truth. 
JIM	m	So could do. You were there, too. 
KIM	?	It wasn't my idea. You know I didn't want to do  it. 
JIM	m	But you did do it. I don't get why you give  such a shit anyway. 
BILL	m	Well, we are going to try to help you find a  way to replace the drapes and the towels, but  our confidence in you, Edward, is not going to  be so easy to replace. 
KIM	?	Dad! 
BILL	m	Okay, a little ethics. You are walking down the  street. You find a suitcase full of money.  There's nobody around. No human person is in  evidence. What do you do? A You keep the money. B You use it to buy gifts for your friends and  your loved ones. C You give it to the poor. D You turn it into the police. 
KIM	?	That is really stupid. 
PEG	f	Kim! 
KEVIN	m	I keep the money. 
PEG	f	Simmer down. 
BILL	m	Edward? 
KIM	?	Hey, how about after dinner we go down to the  bowling alley? That will be fun. 
PEG	f	You are not seeing Jim tonight? 
KIM	?	No. 
KEVIN	m	You know we had a cool show-and-tell today.  This kid brought in a box of baby possums, 10.  maybe 12. Totally naked. No hair at all. 
PEG	f	Honey, this is fascinating. but I don't think  your father's finished yet. 
BILL	m	Thank you, dear. Edward, we are waiting. 
EDWARD	m	Give it to my loved ones? 
PEG	f	Oh, Edward, it does seem that that's what you  should do, bit it's not. 
KEVIN	m	You dope, everybody knows he's supposed to give  it to the police. 
BILL	m	Good thinking, Kevin. 
KIM	?	Well, think about it, you guys, I mean, that's  the nicer thing to do. That's what I would do. 
BILL	m	We're trying to make things easier for him, so  let's cut the comedy for a little while. 
KIM	?	I am being serious. It's a nicer thing to do. 
BILL	m	We're not talking nice. We're talking right and  wrong. 
KIM	?	Shut up. 
PEG	f	Oh, goodness sake, no wonder poor Edward can't  learn right from wrong living in his family. 
WOMAN 1	f	Did you hear what he did to Peg's curtains? 
MARGIE	f	It is unbelievable that they're having their  Christmas party anyway. Are you going? 
WOMAN 1	f	Oh, I don't think so. 
MARGIE	f	He practically raped Joyce, you know  threatening her with those knives? It's a  miracle she escaped. 
HELEN	f	I don't have anything against Bill and Peg,  but... 
JOYCE	f	I know, I know. They've got that teenage  daughter in the house. Oh, those poor things  after what happened to me can you imagine? 
HELEN	f	What do you say to Peg about the Christmas  party? 
MARGIE	f	I said I hoped. We'd make it. 
HELEN	f	I lied, too. 
PEG	f	Edward, do you want to give me that new  haircut? 
EDWARD	m	Again? 
PEG	f	yes, sure. 
PEG	f	It makes me proud to have you as my own  personal hairdresser. 
KEVIN	m	Hi, honey. honey. 
EDWARD	m	Kevin, you want to play scissors-paper-stone? 
KEVIN	m	No. 
EDWARD	m	No, why? 
KEVIN	m	It's boring. I'm tired of always winning. 
PEG	f	Other people's feelings? 
KEVIN	m	I'll be outside. 
PEG	f	A few manners? Just never you mind. Just you  cut away. Cut away. It needs something else.  What do you think, honey? 
KIM	?	More bells? 
PEG	f	More bells. Okay. 
KIM	?	Mom, do you really think that we should be  having this party? 
PEG	f	Of course I think we should be having this  party. Of course I do. I mean as just what we  need is just to calm things down and then  everything will just go back to normal. Do you  have any more bells, honey? 
JIM	m	Get the hell out of here. Get the hell out! Go.  Freak! 
BILL	m	Edward, where are you going? 
KIM	?	Where is he? 
JIM	m	He tried to hurt you. 
KIM	?	No, he did not and you know it. 
JIM	m	Are you nuts? I just saw him. 
KIM	?	Jim. I don't love you any more. I just want you  to go. Okay? Just go! 
JIM	m	Are you serious? I'm going to lose you to that?  He isn't even human. 
KIM	?	Just get out of here. Okay? Just go! Dad, did  you see where Edward went? 
BILL	m	Well. I don't know. He just walked down the  street. 
KIM	?	Well, we have to go find him, mom? 
PEG	f	You...your father will find him this minute. 
BILL	m	All in the house. I'll take care of it. I'll go  find him. 
HELEN	f	Edward! I'm calling the police! 
PEG	f	All that blood, sweetie, and it's just a little  cut. 
POLICE	m	Hello, I'm here to see the man with the hands. 
PEG	f	Oh... Uh... 
POLICE	m	He's not here. Thank you. 
PEG	f	Oh, dear. 
MARGIE	f	Helen, did you actually see him? 
HELEN	f	Yes, look. 
ESMERALDA	f	You see, I told you he was a demon. 
MARGIE	f	Oh, don't start that stuff again. 
POLICE	m	I'm looking for the man with scissors. 
WOMEN	f	He went that way. You have to do something  about that. 
POLICE	m	All right, calm down, go on home. We'll handle.  Just go home. 
HELEN	f	He's a de... a demon. 
WOMEN	f	You've got to do something! All right, Let's  see. If he's at our house come on, oh... 
PEG	f	I'm sure your father will find him soon. 
KIM	?	What time is it? 
PEG	f	It's almost eight thirty. Great party, huh? 
KIM	?	Where are they? God. I hope he's okay! 
PEG	f	So do I, honey. You know, when I brought Edward  down here to live with us, I really didn't  think things through. And I didn't think about  what could happen to him, or to us, or to the  neighborhood. You know, I think that maybe it  might be best if he goes back up there. Because  at least there he's safe, and we'd just go back  to normal. 
BILL	m	Now I got up by the Wiggmans, but I didn't see  him anywhere. 
PEG	f	Oh, dear. Oh, just... Well, let's get in the  car and go look for him. 
BILL	m	Where's Kevin now? 
PEG	f	He's Max'es. 
BILL	m	Where do you think you're going, young lady? 
KIM	?	With you guys. 
BILL	m	No, you're staying here in case somebody shows  up! 
PEG	f	We'll be right back, dear. 
EDWARD	m	Police! 
KIM	?	Edward? 
EDWARD	m	Are you okay? 
KIM	?	Yes, are you okay? 
EDWARD	m	Where's everybody? 
KIM	?	Out looking for you. Hold me. 
EDWARD	m	I can't. 
INVENTOR	m	I know it's a little early for Christmas,  Edward, but I have a present for you. 
JIM	m	Forget holding her hand. Picture the damage he  could do other places. 
JIM'S FRIEND	m	Yeah, that's sick. I feel like I'm coming to  pass out, or puke or something. 
JIM	m	Later, first take me to her house. 
JIM'S FRIEND	m	Come on, don't make me drive. 
JIM	m	Just do it! 
JIM'S FRIEND	m	Jesus, maybe she was right about you. 
JIM	m	Just drive. 
JIM'S FRIEND	m	Relax. 
KEVIN	m	See you tomorrow. Call me, Right? 
A MAN	m	Have they caught him yet? 
KEVIN	m	Who? 
A MAN	m	Him, that cripple. Let me know when they do.  Let us all you know, okay? Like a good boy. 
EDWARD	m	Oh! Are you ok? oh! owh! 
KEVIN	m	Help! Edward help! 
EDWARD	m	I'm your friend. 
KEVIN	m	Stop! Don't! Stop! Get away, now! Somebody help  us! Help! 
PEOPLE 1	m	What are you doing? Get away!  
PEOPLE 2	m	Get the police! 
PEOPLE 3	m	Somebody call the police! Hey 
KIM	?	Let go of me! Why? Kevin! 
PEG AND BILL	f	Kevin! Kevin! Edward! Get away. What happened?  Edward! Go home! Go home! 
PEOPLE	m	Somebody call the police! Aah!  
KIM	?	Jim, stop it. Get off him! 
KIM	?	Run. 
PEG	f	Kevin's all right! It was just the tiniest  scratch! He's gone! Let's not bother him, all  right? Let just leave him alone! 
POLICE	m	Go on, run. 
PEOPLE	m	What happened? Did you get him? Ok, Is he dead? 
POLICE	m	It's all over, go on home. There's nothing more  to see. What happened out there? It's all over! 
PEOPLE	m	I want some answers. Where is he? 
PEOPLE	m	Get back here! I want to ask you something. Do  you see him? Wait! I want to ask you... He's in  that car. Look at that. 
JOYCE	f	I don't believe it. They don't have him. I'm  going! No! That's not a good idea! 
EDWARD	m	They are coming? Did I hurt Kevin? 
KIM	?	No, he's okay. He said he was just scared.  Edward, I was so afraid. I thought you were  dead. 
JIM	m	I didn't. 
KIM	?	Jim. Stop! Stop it, or I'll kill you myself. 
JIM	m	Hey! I said stay away from her! 
EDWARD	m	Goodbye! 
KIM	?	I love you. 
A MAN	m	Is he in there? 
KIM	?	He's dead. The roof caved in on him. They  killed each other. You can see for yourselves.  
OLD KIM	m	She never saw him again. Not after that night. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	How do you know? 
OLD KIM	m	Because I was there. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	You could have gone up there. You still could  go. 
OLD KIM	m	No, sweetheart. I'm an old woman now. I would  rather want him remember me the way as I was. 
GRANDDAUGHTER	?	How do you know he's still alive. 
OLD KIM	m	I don't know. Not for sure. But I believe he  is. You see, before he came down here, it never  snowed. And afterwards it did. If he weren't up  there now, I don't think it would be snowing.  Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.
