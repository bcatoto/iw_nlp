SURGEON 1 	m	Is this the last one?
SURGEON 2 	m	God, what a mess... at least there's  no gangrene.
SURGEON 1 	m	There will be if it doesn't come  off.
SURGEON 2 	m	Well I can't saw if I can't keep my  eyes open.  Let's coffee up... he  can wait a few more minutes.
PEPPER	?	Lieutenant... izat you?
PEPPER	?	What're you doing here lieutenant?
DUNBAR	m	This is where I belong... this is my  outfit.
PEPPER	?	You went to hospital?
DUNBAR	m	It was no good... what's going on  here?
PEPPER	?	Better come to cover lieutenant...  those boys are shooters.
PEPPER	?	What's goin' on here... seems to be  the question alright... you could  ask the major but he don't know.  He's busy tryin' to figger out how  come the officer's mess run outta  peach ice cream...
PEPPER	?	General's come up to see the show  but all he knows is there ain't no  show...
PEPPER	?	We started a balloon up but they  shot her down fore she was ten feet  off the ground... so nobody's made a  run either way. It's been a stand- off all damn day... and now... the  major, he's lookin' at the general  and he's thinkin' I better do  somethin', and you know what that  means...
PEPPER	?	They're 'sposed to be beat up just  like us but everybody knows that  Tucker's men are tough as cobs. I  sure don't wanna die out there with  them cows.
PEPPER	?	Some of the boys are sayin' that if  we ain't gonna fight we could just  settle the whole business with a  little high stakes poker. Wouldn't  that be a sight... a bunch of fellas  sittin' in the middle of this field  drawin' cards...
RAY	m	Tucker!
AIDE	f	What is it sir?
TIDE	m	Looks like a suicide.
CONFEDERATE	?	Come on you son of a bitch -- you  won't make it a second time...
DUNBAR	m	Alright by me.
DUNBAR	m	Forgive me Father.
DUNBAR	m	Don't take off my foot.
GENERAL TIDE	m	You rest easy son... you'll keep  you're foot. As God is my judge,  you'll keep it.
GENERAL TIDE	m	Bring up my ambulance...
AIDE	f	Sir?
GENERAL TIDE	m	Bring up my ambulance. And bring my  surgeon with it. We've got an officer  who's worth something lying here.
DUNBAR 	m	The strangeness of this life cannot  be measured. In trying to produce my  own death, I was elevated to the  status of a living hero.
DUNBAR	m	Where can I find Major... Fambrough?
ELGIN	m	Turn right... all the way to the end  of the hall.
FAMBROUGH 	?	Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR	m	Sir?
FAMBROUGH	?	Lt. John J. Dunbar.
DUNBAR	m	Yes sir?
FAMBROUGH	?	Indian fighter, huh?
DUNBAR	m	Excuse me?
FAMBROUGH	?	Your orders say you are to be posted  on the frontier. The frontier is  Indian country. I quickly deduced  that you are an Indian fighter.
FAMBROUGH	?	I did not ascend to this position by  being stupid.
DUNBAR	m	No sir.
FAMBROUGH	?	It says here you've been decorated.
DUNBAR	m	Yes sir.
FAMBROUGH	?	And they sent you out here to be  posted?
DUNBAR	m	Actually sir, I'm here at my own  request... I want to see the frontier.
FAMBROUGH	?	You want to see the frontier?
DUNBAR	m	Yes sir... before it's gone.
FAMBROUGH	?	Such a smart lad coming straight to  me.
FAMBROUGH	?	Sir Knight, I am sending you on a  knight's errand. You will report to  Captain Cargill at the furthermost  outpost of the realm... Fort  Sedgewick.
FAMBROUGH	?	My personal seal will assure you  safe passage through many miles of  wild hostile country.
DUNBAR	m	I'm wondering sir, how will I be  getting there?
FAMBROUGH	?	You think I don't know?
DUNBAR	m	No sir, it's just that I don't know.
FAMBROUGH	?	Hold your tongue.
FAMBROUGH	?	I'm in a generous mood and will grant  your boon. You see that peasant...  he calls himself Timmons... he leaves  this very afternoon for your Fort  Sedgewick. Ride with him if you  like... he knows the way. That is  all.
FAMBROUGH 	?	Sir Knight...
FAMBROUGH	?	I just pissed in my pants... and  nobody can do anything about it.
FAMBROUGH	?	Noooo, noooo...
ELGIN	m	It's alright Major.
SERGEANT	m	Leave him alone lieutenant... he's  cracked.
FAMBROUGH	?	Nooo, nooo...
ELGIN	m	Don't sergeant.
FAMBROUGH	?	Are you deaf fool. I said I'll have  my crown this instant... this instant!
ELGIN	m	Let's have the pistol.
SERGEANT	m	Don't do it.
FAMBROUGH	?	The king is dead... long live the  king.
DUNBAR 	m	Were it not for my companion I believe  I would be having the time of my  life. He is quite possibly the foulest  person I have ever met.
DUNBAR 	m	We have been gone four days now and  still we have seen no signs of life.  Only earth and sky.
DUNBAR	m	How far do you make the fort?
TIMMONS	m	Far.
DUNBAR	m	How far?
TIMMONS	m	Forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's  the big hurry on Sedgewick?
DUNBAR	m	It's going to be my post... my home.
TIMMONS	m	You ain't hard to please, I'll say  that.
TIMMONS	m	Look yonder.
TIMMONS	m	Somebody back east is sayin'... "why  don't he write?" Stupid bastard.
CARGILL	m	Corporal Guest... Corporal Guest...  Corporal Guest. Corporal Guest, you  don't have to talk to me... just  please come out.
CARGILL	m	It's the end... assemble the men in  front of my quarters.
CARGILL	m	You hate me... but I feel none of  the same for you... you men stayed.  You stayed after they took all our  horses. You stayed after all the  others deserted. You stayed on the  promise that the army would resupply  us. I've looked for that wagon from  Fort Hays just as you have... day  after miserable day. All I can say  is that I'm proud of you. Get your  things men, we're leaving this place.  The army... can go to hell.
DUNBAR	m	Timmons... Timmons.
DUNBAR	m	Timmons.
DUNBAR	m	Something's out there...
TIMMONS	m	Somethin' dead.
DUNBAR	m	Might have a look.
TIMMONS	m	Might stay clear of whatever did the  killin'.
DUNBAR	m	How come we haven't seen any buffalo?
TIMMONS	m	Can't figger the stinkin' buffalo.  Sometimes you don't see 'em for days,  sometimes they're thick as curls on  a whore.
DUNBAR	m	What about Indians?
TIMMONS	m	Goddamn Indians you'd jus' as soon  not see, lessen the bastards're dead.  Nothing but thieves and beggars.
TIMMONS	m	Not what you'd call a going concern.
TIMMONS	m	Ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
TIMMONS 	m	Everybody's run off... or got kilt.
DUNBAR	m	Alright...lets unload the wagon.
TIMMONS	m	What, and leave it all here?
DUNBAR	m	I'm staying too... we don't know  what's happened.
TIMMONS	m	There ain't nothin' here lieutenant.
DUNBAR	m	Not at the moment, no.
TIMMONS	m	So things bein' the way they are we  might as well turn around and get  started back.
DUNBAR	m	This is my post...
TIMMONS	m	This is my... are you crazy boy?
DUNBAR	m	This is my post! And these are the  post's provisions. Now get your ass  off that wagon and help me unload.
TIMMONS	m	Well... I'll let 'em know where you  are.
DUNBAR	m	Good.
TIMMONS	m	Good luck lieutenant.
DUNBAR	m	Thank you.
DUNBAR 	m	Have arrived to find Fort Sedgewick  deserted. Am now waiting for the  garrison's return or word from  headquarters. Post is in exceedingly  poor condition. Have decided to assign  myself clean-up duty beginning  tomorrow. Supplies abundant. The  country is everything I dreamed it  would be. There can be no place like  this on earth.
DUNBAR	m	Damn... damn.
THE TOUGHEST	m	Only a white man would make a fire  for everyone to see.
1ST PAWNEE	m	Maybe there's more than one.
2ND PAWNEE	m	We have no rifles. White men are  sure to have rifles.
3RD PAWNEE	m	We should forget this and go home.
TOUGHEST	m	Then go. I for one, will not debate  the merit of a single line of smoke  in my own country.
1ST PAWNEE	m	He will not quit until we are all  dead.
DUNBAR 	m	No sign of Captain Cargill's command.  I don't know what to do. Communication  can only take place if I leave and I  don't want to abandon my post.
DUNBAR 	m	Made a short patrol yesterday p.m...  discovered nothing. Will go further  tomorrow.
DUNBAR 	m	There is a wolf who seems intent on  the goings on here. He does not seem  inclined to be a nuisance however  and aside from Cisco has been my  only company. He has appeared each  afternoon for the past two days. He  has milky white socks on both feet.  If he comes calling tomorrow I will  name him Two Socks.
DUNBAR 	m	Almost a month and no one has come.  The longer this condition persists,  the less inclined I am to believe  that anyone will. Rain has forced me  indoors for most of two days. I have  begun an awning. The work has ruined  my hands, but I am excited about the  improvement it will bring to this  place.
DUNBAR 	m	It is the loneliest of times... but  I cannot say that I am unhappy.
DUNBAR	m	You there!
DUNBAR 	m	Have made first contact with a wild  Indian. One came to the fort and  tried to steal my horse. Do not know  how many more are in the vicinity  but I am taking steps for another  visitation. Am burying excess  ordnance, lest it fall into enemy  hands.
DUNBAR 	m	Have made all the preparations I can  think of. I cannot mount an adequate  defense but will try to make a big  impression when they come. Waiting.
DUNBAR 	m	The man I encountered was a  magnificent looking fellow.
TEN BEARS	m	Kicking Bird has been keeping to  himself these last few days. I do  not like to see our medicine man  walking so alone.
TEN BEARS	m	What does his wife say?
PRETTY SHIELD	f	He is keeping to himself.
PRETTY SHIELD	f	That's what she says.
TEN BEARS	m	Make sure that meat is soft... my  teeth hurt.
TEN BEARS	m	May I come in?
TEN BEARS	m	No, no let him sit with me.
TEN BEARS	m	Our country seems good this summer,  but I have not been out to see it.
KICKING BIRD	m	Yes... it is good. The grass is rich.  The game is plenty and not running  away.
TEN BEARS	m	I am glad to hear it. But the buffalo  are late. I always worry about the  bellies of our children.
KICKING BIRD	m	I was thinking of a dance.
TEN BEARS	m	Yes, a dance is always a good idea.  It would be good to have a strong  sign.
KICKING BIRD	m	Yes.
TEN BEARS	m	There's a funny thing about signs.  They are always flying in our faces.  We know when they are bad or good  but sometimes they are strange and  there is no way to understand them.  Sometimes they make people crazy but  a smart man will take such a sign  into himself and let it run around  for two or three days. If he is still  confused he will tell somebody. He  might come to you or to me and tell  it. A smart man always does that.
KICKING BIRD	m	I have seen such a sign.
TEN BEARS	m	Oh?
KICKING BIRD	m	I saw a man, a white man.
TEN BEARS	m	Just one?
KICKING BIRD	m	Just one. He was naked.
TEN BEARS	m	Are you sure it was a man?
KICKING BIRD	m	I saw his sex.
TEN BEARS	m	Did you speak to him?
KICKING BIRD	m	No.
TEN BEARS	m	We will council on this.
KICKING BIRD	m	He might be a god or he might be a  special chief -- that's why we are  thinking of having a talk with him.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I do not care for this talk about a  white man. Whatever kind of white  man he is, he is not Sioux and that  makes him less. We've camped here  for ten days now and each day our  scouts find nothing. One old bull  with wolves tearing him apart, nothing  more. We need meat -- not talk.
KICKING BIRD	m	You are right, we need meat today  and tomorrow. But we must also have  meat in ten years.
KICKING BIRD	m	But the whites are coming. Our friends  the Shoshone and the Kiowa, even our  enemies, agree on this -- the whites  are coming. More than can be counted.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Kicking Bird is always looking ahead  and that is good. But when I hear  that more whites are coming -- more  than can be counted I want to laugh.  We took a hundred horses from these  people, there was no honor in it.  They don't ride well, they don't  shoot well, they're dirty. They have  no women, no children. They could  not even make it through one winter  in our country. And these people are  said to flourish? I think they will  all be dead in ten years.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I think this white man is probably  lost.
KICKING BIRD	m	Wind In His Hair has spoken straight,  his words are strong and I have heard  them. It's true the whites are a  poor race and it's hard to understand  them. But when I see one white man  alone, without fear in our country,  I do not think he is lost. I think  he may have medicine. I see someone  who might speak for all the white  people who are coming. I think this  is a person with which treaties might  be struck.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	This white man cannot cover our  lodges, or string our bows, or feed  our children. I will take some good  men... there are many here tonight.  We will ride to the soldier fort, we  will shoot some arrows into this  white man. If he truly has medicine  he will not be hurt. If he has no  medicine he will be dead.
TEN BEARS	m	It is easy to become confused by  these questions. It is hard to know  what to do. No man can tell another  how he will be. But I know this...  killing a white man is a delicate  matter. If you kill one, more are  sure to come. We should talk about  this some more.
SMILES A LOT	m	What's the matter now?
WORM	m	Otter doesn't want to go.
SMILES A LOT	m	If we take the horse of a white god  they will make up songs about us.
OTTER	m	Maybe.
SMILES A LOT	m	They will ask us to go on raids.
OTTER	m	Who gets the white god horse?
SMILES A LOT	m	I do... but we share... you and Worm  can ride him too. Who can say this  is not a great plan?
SMILES A LOT	m	Let me take him Otter.
OTTER	m	I have him.
SMILES A LOT	m	What happened?
OTTER	m	I don't know. My arm doesn't work.
SMILES A LOT	m	You shouldn't have fallen down...  now we'll get in trouble.
OTTER	m	It was your idea.
SMILES A LOT	m	My idea was only to take the horse.
SMILES A LOT	m	Otter hurt himself.
OTTER	m	You're not hurt... I'm hurt.
WORM	m	I will be when my father finds out,  his bow will be across my back.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I am Wind In His Hair. Do you not  see that I am not afraid of you?...  Do you see?
COURIER	m	The party that went against the Pawnee  is coming in...
COURIER	m	There are many hearts on the ground.
DUNBAR 	m	I realize now that I have been wrong.  All this time I have been waiting.  Waiting for what? For someone to  find me? For Indians to take my horse?  To see a buffalo?
DUNBAR 	m	Since I arrived at this post I have  been walking on eggs. It has become  a bad habit and I am sick of it.  Tomorrow morning I will ride out to  the Indians. I do not know the outcome  or the wisdom of this thinking. But  I have become a target and a target  makes a poor impression. I am through  waiting.
DUNBAR	m	Wait...
DUNBAR	m	Wait... you're hurt.
DUNBAR	m	Let me help you.
DUNBAR	m	You're hurt... you need help.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Don't...
DUNBAR	m	She's hurt.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You are not welcome here.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Go away from us...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Go away from us... go now.
KICKING BIRD	m	The soldier did not come to fight --  he is going away and we will let  him.
TEN BEARS	m	I am in agreement with Kicking Bird.  We will go down and talk to the white  man and find out what kind of white  man he is.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	If this council decides to talk with  the man at the soldier fort then it  will be so. But in my mind it is not  right that a Sioux chief, a chief as  great as Ten Bears, goes to ask the  business of a puny, trespassing white  man... a white soldier who has only  a smart horse and a few white man  clothes.
TEN BEARS	m	I will not go... you will go... you  and Kicking Bird. That is all I have  to say.
DUNBAR	m	Welcome... Come... please... sit down.
DUNBAR	m	Would you like some coffee? Coffee?
DUNBAR	m	I'll get some cups.
DUNBAR	m	Is the coffee not good? Too strong  maybe? Here...
DUNBAR	m	Do you want some?
DUNBAR	m	So what are you guys doing? Looking  for buffalo?
DUNBAR	m	He's a good one... good horse. My  horse.
DUNBAR	m	Good horse.
DUNBAR	m	My horse. You see any buffalo?
DUNBAR	m	Wait just a bit.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	His mind is gone.
KICKING BIRD	m	Buffalo.
DUNBAR	m	Buffalo?
KICKING BIRD	m	Buffalo.
DUNBAR	m	Buffalo.
DUNBAR	m	Buffalo.
DUNBAR 	m	The sugar didn't figure to last at  that rate any way. I don't believe  I'd go too far in saying that a  foundation for good relations is  being laid.
DUNBAR 	m	They have come again, as always the  same two with an escort of six.
KICKING BIRD	m	Have you seen any buffalo?
DUNBAR 	m	I believe I am dealing with Kiowa  Indians as I have heard that word on  several occasions.
DUNBAR 	m	I am learning the Kiowa words for  head, hand, horse, fire, coffee,  buffalo, hello and goodbye.
DUNBAR	m	No, I haven't seen any buffalo. Are  you hungry? I have food... are you  hungry?
ESCORT 1	?	He waved.
DUNBAR 	m	Nothing I have been told about these  people is correct. They are not  beggars and thieves. They are not  the bogeymen they have been made out  to be.
KICKING BIRD 	m	Stands With A Fist.
KICKING BIRD	m	We will talk awhile.
KICKING BIRD	m	Your wounds are healing well?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Yes.
KICKING BIRD	m	You are happy here, with my family?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I am glad to be here. I am missing  my husband.
KICKING BIRD	m	Perhaps you will marry again when  the time is right.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Perhaps.
KICKING BIRD	m	We have word from many places that  the whites are...
KICKING BIRD	m	They are coming into everyone's  country. They will soon be in ours I  think. This white man who lives at  the old soldier fort, the one who  calls himself loo ten tant... I have  visited him and I believe his heart  is a good one. He knows things about  the whites which we do not.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I am afraid of the man at the fort.
KICKING BIRD	m	He is only one man.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I am afraid that he will tell some  whites that I am here. I am afraid  that they will try to take me away.
KICKING BIRD	m	Every warrior in camp would fight  them if they tried.
KICKING BIRD	m	I cannot make the white man talk.  Loo ten tant does not know Sioux.
KICKING BIRD	m	You have a certain medicine which no  other Sioux -- man or woman -- has.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	It has been a long time since I made  the talk.
KICKING BIRD	m	I do not ask this for myself... I  ask this for all our people.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	It's dead in me.
KICKING BIRD	m	I want you to try and remember the  the word.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I don't know how.
KICKING BIRD	m	You don't want to know.
BLACK SHAWL	m	Will she make the white words?
KICKING BIRD	m	Perhaps I am asking too much.
VOICE	m	Christine...
MOTHER 	f	Christine... where are you?
CHRISTINE	f	I'm right here mother...
MOTHER	f	Get inside both of you.
CHRISTINE	f	Why?
MOTHER	f	Just do what I... oh God! Stay where  you are. Keep down do you hear me?
CHRISTINE	f	Who is it Willie?
WILLIE	m	They look like Pawnee... my father  and your father are talking to them.
WILLIE	m	Run Christine...
CHRISTINE	f	Why?
WILLIE	m	Just run!
WILLIE	m	Run!
CHRISTINE	f	Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray  the lord my soul to keep. If I die  before I wake, I pray the lord my  soul to take.
DUNBAR	m	Buffalo...
DUNBAR	m	Buffalo... Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD	m	Buffalo?
DUNBAR	m	Yes. Buffalo.
KICKING BIRD	m	The buffalo have come.
SMILES A LOT	m	Loo ten tant...
KICKING BIRD 	m	Loo ten tant...
CHRISTINE	f	Help...
CHRISTINE	f	Help me... Please... I need to get out.
DUNBAR	m	I wish I knew what to say.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Say... thank you.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	His speed... his power... you have.
DUNBAR	m	Thank you.
DUNBAR	m	Look I'm full... I can't tell the  story again.
DUNBAR	m	Go ahead.
DUNBAR	m	You want to try... put it on.
DUNBAR	m	Here.
DUNBAR	m	This is too much... I can't take  this...
DUNBAR	m	I can't... No more...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	One more... eat...
DUNBAR	m	I can't, I'm full... very full...
DUNBAR	m	That's my hat.
DUNBAR	m	My hat.
BIG WARRIOR	m	I found it on the prairie. It's mine.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	That hat belongs to my friend here.
BIG WARRIOR	m	He left it on the prairie. He didn't  want it.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You can see that he wants it now.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	We all know that is a soldier hat.  We all know who wears it. If you  want to keep it that's alright. But  give something for it.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Good trade.
DUNBAR	m	Yes, it's good. But, I have to sleep.
KICKING BIRD	m	Where is loo ten tant?
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I ate him.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I traded for it.
KICKING BIRD	m	Does it scratch the skin?
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	A little. But do you see how good it  looks. Everyone says it looks good.  Everyone.
DUNBAR	m	They asked me to dance...
DUNBAR	m	I was just dancing...
DUNBAR 	m	To stay any longer would've been  useless. We had all the meat we could  possibly carry. We had hunted for  three days, losing half a dozen ponies  and only three men injured. Many  times I have felt alone but until  this afternoon, I have never felt  completely lonely.
DUNBAR 	m	Made a long patrol today. There is  nothing to report. The truth is I am  bored.
DUNBAR 	m	Though only two days it seems like a  week. I am missing the company of my  new friends. I can see all of their  faces, but somehow it is not enough.  Tomorrow, I will make an unannounced  visit. After all, they are my  neighbors, what can it hurt?
DUNBAR	m	Go home.
DUNBAR	m	Damn him.
DUNBAR	m	C'mon Two Socks... you can't go...  so go home.
DUNBAR	m	Alright then, don't go home. But  stay... stay right here.
DUNBAR	m	You go home.
STONE CALF	m	You were right about loo ten tant --  he is a special white man.
KICKING BIRD	m	Yes, he is special... he should have  a real name.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Not everyone thinks it is a good  idea that he is here.
KICKING BIRD	m	I know.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Kicking Bird has business with the  white man. Let him do it.
KICKING BIRD	m	We were waiting for you.
KICKING BIRD	m	Welcome. It is good that you are  here.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Hullo. You here... good.
DUNBAR	m	Thank you... I feel good.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He thanks you. It is good.
KICKING BIRD	m	Ask him why he is at the soldier  fort.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Uhh... you... come...
DUNBAR	m	Wait... what is your name?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Our... names?
KICKING BIRD	m	What does he say?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He wants to know how we are called.
KICKING BIRD	m	Ahhh... He's right. I'm sorry.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He... he... Kick...
DUNBAR	m	Kick?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	More.
DUNBAR	m	Kicking?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Kicking... yes... Kicking... Bird.
DUNBAR	m	Kicking Bird... What does he... is he a chief?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Hul... hal... ho-lee... holy... holy  man.
DUNBAR	m	Oh...
DUNBAR	m	Your name... you.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I don't know.
DUNBAR	m	Up? Get up?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	No.
DUNBAR	m	Stand.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Yes... Stands.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	More... Wiff... With.
DUNBAR	m	Stands With A...
DUNBAR	m	Fist?
DUNBAR	m	Stands With A Fist. I'm John... John  Dunbar.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	John Dunbar.
DUNBAR	m	Yes.
DUNBAR 	m	I try to answer all of Kicking Bird's  questions but I know he is frustrated  with me. He always wants to know how  many more white people are coming. I  tell him that it is impossible for  me to say. When he persists I tell  him that the white people will most  likely pass through this country and  nothing more.
DUNBAR 	m	But I am speaking to him in half- truths. One day there will be too  many, but I cannot bring myself to  tell him that. I am sure that Stands  With A Fist knows.
DUNBAR 	m	A war party is going against the  Pawnee soon and I have asked to go.  I sensed that I have made a mistake  in doing so but I could not bring  myself to take it back. They are my  friends and from what little I gather  the Pawnee have been very hard on  these people. I hope I have not  overstepped my bounds.
DUNBAR	m	I'm glad to see you... please sit.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Kicking Bird wants to know why you  want to make war on the Pawnee. They  have done nothing to you.
DUNBAR	m	They are Sioux enemies.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Only Sioux warriors will go.
DUNBAR	m	I asked that he would think about my  going.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He has.
DUNBAR	m	Then tell him this. I have been a  warrior for longer than many of the  young men that will go on this war  party. Tell him.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He says that the Sioux way of being  a warrior is not the white way. You  are not ready.
DUNBAR	m	I know, I understand. But I cannot  learn these ways in camp.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He asks that you watch over his family  while he is gone.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	This thing he asks you... it is a  great honor for you.
DUNBAR	m	I will be happy to watch over your  family.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He thanks Dances With Wolves for  coming.
DUNBAR	m	Who is Dances With Wolves?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	It is the name which everyone is  calling you now.
DUNBAR	m	Dances With Wolves... that's right. How do you say it?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Dances With Wolves.
DUNBAR	m	Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD	m	Keep on with the white man talk if  it pleases you.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I like to make the white man talk.
STANDS WITH A FIST 	m	Dances With Wolves?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I'm here.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Grass grows on the prairie.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Fire lives on the prairie.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Wrong.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	That man is a fighter.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Again.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	That man is a fighter.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Alright... I have it... That man...
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Yes...
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Is...
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	A... bone!
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	A bone... right?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	What is the word for beautiful?
LITTLE BOY	m	What are you doing here?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	It is hot. We are sitting in the  shade.
LITTLE BOY	m	I'm hungry.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Alright.
SMILES A LOT	m	...a bone.
BLACK SHAWL	m	How is Dances With Wolves?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	What do you mean?
BLACK SHAWL	m	How is he learning?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	He learns well... he is fast.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	You go for water?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Yes.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Let us take you.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	How did you get your name?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I was not very old when I came to be  with the people... I was made to  work.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I worked every day... very hard...  there was a woman who didn't like  me. She called me bad names...  sometimes she beat me. One day she  was calling me these bad names, her  face in my face, and I hit her. I  was not very big, but she fell down.  She fell hard and didn't move. I  stood over her with my fist and asked  if any other woman wanted to call me  bad names... No one bothered me after that day.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I would not think so.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Show me where you hit her.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Why are you not married?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I must go.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I'm sorry. Let me help...
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	No.
BLACK SHAWL	m	You are not talking today?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	No, I'm not.
STONE CALF	m	Some of your words are wrong... but  you are learning fast. That is good.  What can I tell you today?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I want to know about Stands With A  Fist.
STONE CALF	m	What is your question?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	There is no man with her.
STONE CALF	m	She is in mourning.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I do not understand "mourning".
STONE CALF	m	She is crying for someone.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Crying for who?
STONE CALF	m	It is not polite to speak of the  dead... But I will tell you... you  are new. She cries for her husband.  He was killed not long ago.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	How long will she cry?
STONE CALF	m	It is Kicking Bird's place to say  when she is finished.
BLACK SHAWL	m	People are talking about you...
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	What are they saying?
BLACK SHAWL	m	They are proud of the medicine you  are making with Dances With Wolves.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I have hurt him and I must go talk  to him.
BLACK SHAWL	m	You can't, he is gone.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I am in mourning.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I know... Stone Calf told me.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	No one can know... we must be careful.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Yes.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	We must be careful.
SMILES A LOT	m	What are you doing?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Nothin'.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Nothin'.
WORM	m	We got a snake.
OTTER	m	We're gonna see if it can swim the  river. You wanna come?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Okay.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Don't do that!
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Trouble...
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Pawnee... a big party... thirty or  forty men. The Kiowa hunters found them not far  to the north. The Pawnee are coming  his way. Soon they will find our  camp.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Stone Calf... I follow you.
STONE CALF	m	The Pawnee do not come for horses,  they come for blood... and with many  men gone, we are few.
STONE CALF	m	Get your weapons and come to my lodge.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	I will go.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Stone Calf... wait...
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I have guns... many far-shooting  guns.
TEN BEARS	m	No, the ride is long... the weather  is bad. We can spare no men.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Guns would make one warrior like  two.
TEN BEARS	m	Take one man and go quickly.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I will take Smiles A Lot.
SMILES A LOT	m	Dances With Wolves... Dances With  Wolves.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Wait.
TEN BEARS	m	Hear us now. A white soldier with many far-shooting  guns... how would he fight the Pawnee?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I would hide in the village.
TEN BEARS	m	Dances With Wolves has not finished.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I would let the enemy think we are  asleep... let him come close. Then  we would shoot together and run to  fight them, drive them into the river  and kill so many that they would  never trouble us again.
TEN BEARS	m	I am of the same mind as Dances With  Wolves... we should kill so many  that they never trouble us again.
SIOUX 1	m	I killed this one.
SIOUX 2	m	This one still breathes.
SIOUX 3 	m	Dances With Wolves...
DANCES WITH WOLVES 	m	It was hard to know how to feel. I  had never been in a battle like this  one. This had not been a fight for  territory or riches or to make men  free. This battle had no ego. It had  been fought to preserve the food  stores that would see us through  winter, to protect the lives of women  and children and loved ones only a  few feet away. I felt a pride I had  never felt before.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I shot this one.
1ST WARRIOR	m	Yes, I saw you shoot him.
2ND WARRIOR	m	You killed that one too.
DANCES WITH WOLVES 	m	I had never really known who John  Dunbar was. Perhaps because the name  itself had no meaning. But as I heard  my Sioux name being called over and  over, I knew for the first time who  I really was.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	There is gambling tonight... at Horse  Back's lodge. Horse Back's games are  always good.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I am tired... and Horse Back already  has a good rifle of mine. thank you... goodnight.
BLACK SHAWL	m	How long will Stands With A Fist  mourn?
KICKING BIRD	m	I don't know.
BLACK SHAWL	m	I hope it will not be too long.
KICKING BIRD	m	Something has happened? Well what?
BLACK SHAWL	m	She has found love again.
KICKING BIRD	m	With who?
BLACK SHAWL	m	Dances With Wolves.
KICKING BIRD	m	Are you certain of this?
BLACK SHAWL	m	When you see them together you will  know.
KICKING BIRD	m	What are people saying? They're not  angry?
BLACK SHAWL	m	No. They like the match. It makes  sense. They are both white.
KICKING BIRD	m	I suppose I will be the one to say  something.
BLACK SHAWL	m	She's your daughter now.
BLACK SHAWL	m	You can't see everything coming.
KICKING BIRD	m	Stands With A Fist.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	Yes.
KICKING BIRD	m	You are no longer a widow.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	There's talk that you want to get  married.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	To who?
SMILES A LOT	m	To Stands With A Fist.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	That's the one isn't it?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	She's in mourning.
SMILES A LOT	m	Not today.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	She has been released. Kicking Bird  did it.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	He did?
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	What are you doing?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Kicking Bird told me to wait.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You might be waiting a long time.  Smiles A Lot says he saw Kicking  Bird riding on the prairie...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	He says he was talking to himself.  When a medicine man is the last to  know he can take it pretty hard.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	What do I do?
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You are pretty poor my friend and a  Sioux girl is not for free. I don't  know if you can get married.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I have the buckskin...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	That's too much medicine.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Do you think the buckskin is too  much medicine?
SMILES A LOT	m	For a girl.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Maybe we can help you... wait here  for us.
DANCES WITH WOLVES 	m	I thought we had been discreet but  apparently we fooled no one.
DANCES WITH WOLVES 	m	Wind In His Hair said if the match  was acccepted the ponies would be  gone in the morning.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Turn around...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	Pretty good...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You know, the man she mourned for  was my best friend.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I didn't know that.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	He was a good man. It's been hard  for me. I am not the thinker Kicking  Bird is. But I think he went away  from her because you were coming.  That is how I see it now.
KICKING BIRD	m	This is a good day for me.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	And for me.
KICKING BIRD	m	Stands With A Fist... if you want  this man, take his hand in yours.
DANCES WITH WOLVES 	m	I had never been married before. I  don't know if all grooms have the  same experience. But as Kicking Bird  began to speak about what was expected  of a Sioux husband, my mind began to  swim in a way that shut out everything  but her. The tiny details of her  costume. The contours of her shape.  The light in her eyes. The smallness  of her feet. I knew that the love  between us would be served.
KICKING BIRD	m	Have you heard all that I have said?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Yes.
KICKING BIRD	m	Good, then take her inside... she is  your wife.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Oh... good... thank you... goodbye...
WORM	m	Dances With Wolves' door is closed  alot these days.
SMILES A LOT	m	They're trying to make a baby.
OTTER	m	I know that.
SMILES A LOT	m	You would think they could have made  a baby by now.
WORM	m	Maybe they're having a hard time.  Some people have a hard time.
SMILES A LOT	m	I don't think they're having a hard  time.
OTTER	m	Me neither.
OTTER	m	Maybe we should pull the smoke flap  closed. Then they would come out.
KICKING BIRD	m	Dances With Wolves, are you in there?
KICKING BIRD	m	I am riding today to a far away place.  It is a place I haven't seen for a  long time. A sacred place. I would  like you to come with me.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	It's good to be out.
KICKING BIRD	m	Yes it must be.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	We are trying for a baby.
KICKING BIRD	m	No waiting?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	No waiting.
KICKING BIRD	m	I was just thinking that of all the  trails in this life, there is one  that matters more than all the others.  It is the trail of a true human being.  I think you are on this trail and it  is good to see.
KICKING BIRD	m	It is said that all the animals were  born here... that from here they  spread over the prairies to feed all  the people. Even our enemies say  this is a sacred place.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	It's quiet.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	We must wait for these people...
KICKING BIRD	m	No, they've been gone a week maybe  more... we will water the horses and  go home.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	You have asked me many times about  the white people... you always ask  how many more are coming.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	There will be a lot my friend...  more than can be counted.
KICKING BIRD	m	Help me to know how many.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Like the stars.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	It makes me afraid for all the Sioux.
TEN BEARS	m	It's hard to know what to do.
TEN BEARS	m	The men who wore this came in the  time of my grandfather's grandfather.  Eventually, we drove them out. Then  the Mexicans came. In my own time  the whites came... the Texans. They  have been like all the others who  find something they want in our  country. They take it without asking.  I have always been a peaceful man,  happy to be in my own country and  wanting nothing from the white people.  Nothing at all. But I think you are  right. I think they will keep coming.  When I think of that, I look at this  bundle. Our country is all that we  want. We will fight to keep it.
TEN BEARS	m	Tomorrow morning we will strike the  village and go to the winter camp.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	You have everything from the soldier  fort?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	No, there is nothing for me there.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	That's good.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Stands With A Fist... wait...
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	The words in the book are like a  trail for people to follow. It tells  everything about my life here. I  must get it.
KICKING BIRD	m	We cannot wait for you.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I will catch up.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	You killed him...
KICKING BIRD	m	Something has happened... Dances  With Wolves is not coming.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	He must have trouble.
KICKING BIRD	m	Pick two good men with fast ponies  and send them back to the soldier  fort.
BAUER	m	Spivey...
SPIVEY	m	Yessir sergeant...
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Tell the major he's wakin' up... and  move your worthless ass.
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Got yourself a helluva shiner, didn't  ya?
MAJOR	m	Does he speak english?
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Don't know sir... you speak english?  Talk english? Talk?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I speak english...
MAJOR	m	Who are you?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Lieutenant John. J. Dunbar. This is  my post.
MAJOR	m	Why are you dressed like this?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I came out from Fort Hays last April.  But there was no one here.
ELGIN	m	You have proof of that?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	My journal is on the bunk in my  quarters. My orders are in the  journal. It will tell you everything.
ELGIN	m	Spivey, you and Edwards were here  first. Did you find anything... a  journal.
SPIVEY	m	We didn't see nothin' sir.
ELGIN	m	Where's Edwards?
SPIVEY	m	He's outside. But he didn't see  nothin' either.
SERGEANT BAUER	m	You turned Injun, din'cha?
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Din'cha?
ELGIN	m	What is your name?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Dunbar... D.U.N.B.A.R... John.
ELGIN	m	You say you are an officer?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Did you read my orders?
ELGIN	m	No.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	It was in my journal.
ELGIN	m	There are no orders and there is no  journal.
ELGIN	m	Why are you out of uniform?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I have to relieve myself.
GUARD	m	Here you... eyes front.
ELGIN	m	Why are you out of uniform?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	What is the army doing out here?
BAUER	m	Lieutenant's askin' the questions  here.
ELGIN	m	We are charged with apprehending  hostiles, recovering stolen property  and retrieving white captives taken  in hostile raidings.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	There are no hostiles.
MAJOR	m	We will ascertain that for ourselves.  Now if you guide us to these camps  and serve as an interpreter, your  conduct will be reevaluated.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	What conduct?
MAJOR	m	Your status as a traitor might improve  should you choose to cooperate with  the United States Army.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	There is nothing for you to do out  here.
ELGIN	m	Are you willing to cooperate or not?
MAJOR	m	Well, speak up...
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I am Dances With Wolves...
MAJOR	m	What's that?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I am Dances With Wolves... I have  nothing to say to you. You are not  worth talking to.
ELGIN	m	Sergeant... have a detail take him  down to the river... let him clean  up his face.
CRAPPER 	m	You got paper over there Spivey?
SPIVEY	m	What's it to you?
CRAPPER	m	Well gimme some shitbird.
SPIVEY	m	Can you read?
CRAPPER	m	Naw, I can't read. What the hell do  you care... you can't either.
SPIVEY	m	Alright... hold your horses.
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Lap it up Injun.
SERGEANT BAUER	m	Go on ahead Injun... You'll just get  hungrier is all... but mebbe that  don't matter. Word is they're gonna  ship you back to Hays. And they'll  hang you once you get there.
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	You will hold our horses... nothing  more.
SPIVEY	m	I don't see nobody.
SPIVEY	m	Lookit the stupid bastard... he ain't  even runnin'.
BAUER	m	Don't shoot, I seen 'em first...  it's my shot.
DRIVER	m	It's my shot goddamit.
SPIVEY	m	You dumb sons a bitches.
BAUER	m	He mighta killed you.
SOLDIER 1	m	I got him...
SOLDIER 2	m	The hell you did...
SOLDIER 1	m	I got him... dead shot boys.
SPIVEY	m	You want more?... get up... get up.
ELGIN	m	Spivey!
ELGIN	m	I see you bash the prisoner once  more and I'll put those shackles on  you...
ELGIN	m	You men! Get back to your places.
SOLDIER	m	All clear lieutenant...
SMILES A LOT	m	Dances With Wolves... look.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	We go South?
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	We will ride South for two days...  then turn East. No one must follow.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	You have nothing to say?
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	What can I tell you?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	What ever is on your mind.
STANDS WITH A FIST	m	We have decided. You are my husband.  I am your wife. That is all I know.
TEN BEARS	m	Dances With Wolves is quiet these  days.
TEN BEARS	m	Is his heart bad?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Killing the soldiers at the river  was a good thing. It made me free  and my heart was big to see my friends  coming to help me. I did not mind  killing those men. I was glad to do  it.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	But the soldiers hate me now like  they hate no other. I am more than  an enemy to them, I am a traitor.  They will hunt for me. They will not  give up. And when they find me they  find you and that cannot happen.
TEN BEARS	m	Quiet!... sit down Wind In His Hair.  You are hurting an old man's ears  with your loud talk.
TEN BEARS 	m	Dances With Wolves?
TEN BEARS	m	Ahh... this is a nice fire... at my  age a good fire is better than  anything.
TEN BEARS	m	I wondered how your bad heart was  doing and though I would come by and  see for myself. This place doesn't  look so bad-hearted.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	No, we are happy.
TEN BEARS	m	But you are leaving anyway?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I have talked with Stands With a  Fist and we will go together.
TEN BEARS	m	Have you told this to Kicking Bird  or to Wind In His Hair.
TEN BEARS	m	You are the only white man I have  ever known. I have thought about you  alot. More than you know.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	That does not surprise me.
TEN BEARS	m	You have always spoken with your  heart. And like all of us, you are a  free man and can do anything you  like. When I look across this fire,  I do not see a white soldier. I see  only a Sioux named Dances With Wolves.  And there is nothing they hate so  much as a Sioux.
TEN BEARS	m	You are making a pipe?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	Yes?
TEN BEARS	m	This might be a pretty good pipe...  how does it smoke?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I don't know, I haven't tried it  yet.
TEN BEARS	m	Let's smoke it awhile... it is good  to pass the time this way.
KICKING BIRD	m	You've finished your pipe? How does  it smoke?
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	I'm told it smokes well.
KICKING BIRD	m	It doesn't seem possible that we  could come this far.
DANCES WITH WOLVES	m	You were the first man I ever wanted  to be like. I will not forget you.
WIND IN HIS HAIR 	m	Dances With Wolves...
WIND IN HIS HAIR	m	I am Wind In His Hair...
WIND IN HIS HAIR 	m	Can you not see that I am your friend?
WIND IN HIS HAIR 	m	Can you not see that you will always  be my friend?
WIND IN HIS HAIR 	m	Dances With Wolves...
WIND IN HIS HAIR 	m	Dances With Wolves...
