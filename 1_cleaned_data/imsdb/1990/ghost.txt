MOLLY 	f	What a mess!
SAM 	m	I told you!
SAM	m	I can't breathe.
MOLLY	f	Use your mask, dummy.
SAM	m	"Volga boat..., man." Whoomph!
MOLLY	f	Sam, look, there's a whole eight  feet up there.
SAM	m	And about eighty years of dust.
MOLLY	f	We have all this height, Sam. We  could add a second floor and put our  bedroom upstairs. That would leave  all this space.
SAM	m	For what?
MOLLY	f	For space. Just space.
SAM	m	Be great for bumper cars.
CARL	m	Sam, this may be none of my business,  but I'm concerned you're doing too  much coke.
MOLLY	f	Hey, Sam, turn around.
CARL	m	How 'bout me?
CARL	m	I'll never wash again.
MOLLY	f	All together now. One, two, three.
SAM	m	Hey, look what I found. There's a  penny inside. For luck in our new loft. It's a  good omen.
MOLLY	f	You're the good omen.
MOLLY	f	It's gorgeous.
CARL	m	You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you  could sell it tomorrow and double  your investment.
MOLLY	f	Sell it? Carl, we just bought it.
CARL	m	What I wouldn't do for a place like  this.
SAM	m	It's gonna be great.
CARL	m	Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move  your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so  you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He  called yesterday and said he has to  see you today about the Danway stuff.  Three o'clock was the only time he  could make it. Also, the board meeting  in L.A. has been confirmed for the  12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.
CARL	m	Hey, Sam, relax. This isn't brain  surgery you're going into.
SAM	m	I hate pitching to these Japanese  guys. They make me nervous. I mean,  what am I supposed to say, "Who do  you think'll win that big Sumo  championship"?
CARL	m	Sam, you'll be fine. You're great  with people.
CARL	m	Hey, nice. I like those.
SAM	m	...Molly.
CARL	m	Jesus, look at that, a Testerossa.  That's the car I'm gonna drive when  I'm making two hundred grand.
SAM	m	Better pay off your Mustang first.
SAM	m	So Carl, what did the doctor say?
CARL	m	He said it was contagious. Very  contagious. I shouldn't be going  into work today. But what could I do?
SAM	m	And what about the rash?
CARL	m	Not good. It's spreading everywhere.
SAM	m	On your genitals again?
CARL	m	Everywhere. He said be sure not to  touch anyone.
ROSE	f	Morning, Mr. Wheat.
SAM	m	Morning Rose. Listen, when the  Kobiashi people arrive, have Elenore  take them right to the...
ROSE	f	They're already here.
SAM	m	They're early!
ROSE	f	I know. And Andy Dillon called. He  said they need $900,000 transferred  to Albany by noon.
SAM	m	Noon? Damn!
CARL	m	Hold on.
SAM	m	Listen, Dillon needs $900,000 in  Albany by noon. Can you transfer it  to his payroll account?
CARL	m	Sure. Just let me have your MAC code.
SAM	m	Discretion, huh?
CARL	m	You bet. I'll do it right away.
SAM	m	Good morning, Gentlemen. On behalf  of Market Security Bank & Trust, I  welcome you to our city.
MEN	m	Arigato.
SAM	m	I'm afraid that's the only Japanese  I know. But I realize it's not our  language fluency, or lack of it,  that brings you to Market Security.  Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking  expertise, our ability to represent  and anticipate all of your banking  needs. As you know, we are not the  largest banking establishment in New  York. But, with combined assets of over  200 billion dollars, we have a firm  commitment to the international  marketplace.
SAM	m	Excuse me. Hello?
MOLLY	f	A man and a woman are lying in bed  when the woman's husband suddenly  comes home. Frightened, she tells  the man he has to leave instantly  through the window. He has no time  to dress.
SAM	m	Uh hmm.
MOLLY 	f	It's raining outside. The man, running  naked along the street, sees some  joggers approaching.
MOLLY 	f	One of the joggers calls out. "Hey,  do you always go jogging naked?" And  the man says, "Yes, always."
SAM	m	Okay.
MOLLY 	f	And then the other jogger says, "And  do you always wear a condom?" The  man looks down, embarrassed, and  replies, "Only when it's raining."
SAM	m	Well, that's just fine.
MOLLY 	f	Now just relax and have fun, okay?  It's not the end of the world if you  lose this account. You've always got  me.
SAM	m	Thank you. I'll remember that.
MOLLY 	f	See ya.
MOLLY	f	Where you guys from, the New York  City Ballet?
SAM	m	Saved your life.
MOLLY	f	You bastard. Don't do that to me.  You scared me half to death.
SAM	m	Better than seeing this gorgeous  body splattered all over the street.  Here, look out.
CARL 	m	Sam? Molly? Anybody home?
MOLLY	f	Carl? Did you invite him?
SAM	m	I couldn't keep him away.
CARL	m	Hi, Moll. Hi, Sam. So, how's it goin?
WORKMAN 	m	Where do you want this?
MOLLY	f	In the bedroom.
CARL	m	Wow! The place looks great. Really  great.
MOLLY	f	You like it, huh?
CARL	m	"Like" is hardly the word. I never  imagined it would be this beautiful.  This is incredible.
MOLLY	f	Sam, you kept that chair?
SAM	m	What do you mean? It's comfortable.  For T.V. I love that chair.
MOLLY	f	But it doesn't go with anything.
SAM	m	It goes with me.
MOLLY	f	It's okay, I'll paint it.
SAM	m	It was the middle of December. I was  sitting in my old office, the one  Charlie's in. Suddenly, I heard this  woman screaming. I thought someone'd  been shot or something.
MOLLY	f	They took away my MasterCard. It was  Christmas, for godssake.
SAM	m	She was four thousand dollars over  her limit.
MOLLY	f	It wasn't four thousand. And I'd  already sent in the payment! You're  the ones that lost it.
SAM	m	She's still angry.
MOLLY	f	No I'm not.
SAM	m	Get outta here, Frank! You should have seen her. All pink  and flushed. Her skin was gorgeous,  like a rose. And she's screaming,  demanding to see the president. So  Wilton brought her to me.
CARL	m	You? You weren't even a VP yet.
SAM	m	She didn't know that.
MOLLY	f	Can you believe it? And the next  thing I know, he's telling me his  life story. I couldn't believe it.  Everything. About his divorce, how  he'd just arrived in New York, how  he didn't know any women. And all  with this Montana accent.
SAM	m	What's a Montana accent?
MOLLY	f	The one you always slip into it when  you get nervous. "Yes, Ma'am. Thank  you, Ma'am. Can I fondle your breasts,  Ma'am?"
SAM	m	I wasn't nervous.
MOLLY	f	Admit it. You liked me. You were  interested.
SAM	m	I thought you were cute.
MOLLY	f	Cute? Do you believe this? I should have  been Picasso's mistress. I should  have been living in Barcelona or  Paris. But no, I'm moving in with a  New York banker who thinks I'm cute.
SAM	m	What are you doing?
MOLLY	f	I felt inspired.
SAM	m	At 2:00 am?
SAM	m	You notice Carl's eyes today? They  were all over you.
MOLLY	f	What? Are you jealous? Sam, let me  tell you something. He's not even  looking at me. It's you he idolizes.  He doesn't see me at all... Anyway,  he's not my type.
MOLLY	f	What are you doing?
SAM	m	I feel inspired.
MOLLY	f	What's the matter?
SAM	m	The matter?
MOLLY	f	I can tell.
SAM	m	Nothing... really.
MOLLY	f	You're worried, aren't you? About  moving in together?
SAM	m	No. Not really.
MOLLY	f	Then what? The promotion?
SAM	m	I don't know. A lot of things. I  just don't want the bubble to burst...  Whenever something good happens to  me I'm just afraid I'm going to lose  it.
MOLLY	f	You know what?
SAM	m	What?
MOLLY	f	I love you. I really love you.
SAM	m	Ditto.
SAM	m	Oh Jesus. Another one.
MOLLY	f	Don't watch that stuff.
CORRESPONDENT	?	...It is estimated that 34 people  died in the crash, the second in  less than two weeks.
SAM	m	I should cancel my L.A. trip... These  things always happen in threes.
MOLLY	f	Threes? Sam, get serious. Besides,  you lead a charmed life.
SAM	m	Yeah. So did they.
SAM	m	Amazing, huh? Just like that. Blackout.
SAM	m	A glitch. What's up?
CARL	m	The Mark Greenberg and Larry White  accounts. I can't get in. Your MAC  code doesn't work.
SAM	m	I changed it.
CARL	m	Why? What's up?
SAM	m	Nothing. I just want to nose around  a bit... Can you keep your mouth  shut?
CARL	m	Yeah, sure. Tell me, what's going  on.
SAM	m	I think I've stumbled onto something.  There's too much money in these  accounts.
CARL	m	Too much money. That's ridiculous.  How could there be too much money?
SAM	m	That's what I keep asking myself.
CARL	m	It must be the computer.
SAM	m	I've been checking.
CARL	m	Yeah, Mr. Fixit. Come on, move over. Let me see what  I can do.
SAM	m	Not yet. I'm gonna dig around a bit.
CARL	m	Okay, okay. Just call me when you're  ready for help. So, what are you and Moll doing  tonight?
SAM	m	We're going to the theatre. She wants  to see "Macbeth" at the Spring Street  Repertory.
SAM	m	I loved it.
MOLLY	f	I could tell.
MOLLY	f	Did I tell you what Marcia said?
SAM	m	Six times.
MOLLY	f	Six? No I didn't. Sam, don't be so  blasï¿½. I'll have two major pieces in  the show. The New York Times reviews  her gallery all the time. This could  be huge.
SAM	m	Molly, the "New York Times" is some  frustrated little critic with pimples  on his ass who flunked out of art  school. Who cares what The New York  Times thinks?
MOLLY	f	Eight million readers, that's who.
SAM	m	Your work's beautiful. That's a fact,  Moll. It doesn't matter what anyone  thinks.
MOLLY	f	I want to marry you, Sam.
SAM	m	What?
MOLLY	f	I've been thinking about it for days.  More than thinking. I want to do it.  I want to jump in whole hog... What is that look for?
SAM	m	It's just been so long since... I  mean, you never wanted to talk about  it.
MOLLY	f	Do you love me, Sam?
SAM	m	What do you think, Moll?
MOLLY	f	How come you never say it?
SAM	m	What are you talking about?
MOLLY	f	You say "ditto". It's not the same.
SAM	m	People say "I love you" all the time.  It doesn't mean anything.
MOLLY	f	Sometimes you need to hear it.
MOLLY	f	What should we do?
SAM	m	Let me handle this.
WILLIE	m	Your wallet!
MOLLY	f	Give it to him!
SAM	m	Take the money. Just leave the wallet  and my...
MOLLY	f	Sam, No!
MOLLY	f	Sam!!!!!
SAM	m	Molly!
SAM	m	No!!!!!!
SAM	m	This isn't happening. It's not  happening.
SAM	m	Help me!
SAM	m	Do it! Do it!
SAM	m	Molly? Molly!
MOLLY	f	Sam? What's the matter? Is something  wrong?
SAM	m	Molly!
MOLLY	f	What is it, honey?
MOLLY	f	What is it, honey?
SAM	m	What's happening to me?!
MOLLY	f	Don't leave me. I need you, Sam.
SAM	m	Molly!
SAM	m	Molly.
SAM	m	Don't stop! I'm not dead!
MAN	m	So, what happened to you?
SAM	m	What?
MAN	m	You're new, huh? I can tell.
SAM	m	Are you talking to me?
MAN	m	Relax. It ain't like before, you  know. It's a whole new ball-a-wax.
SAM	m	Who are you?
MAN	m	I'm waiting for my wife. She's in  4C. Cardiac wing. She's fighting it.
MAN	m	Shot, huh? That'll do it every time.  Poor bastard. Well, get used to it.  You could be here a long time. I'll tell you a secret. Doors ain't  as bad as you think. Zip zap. They  ain't nothin' at all. You'll see.  You'll catch on.
MAN	m	He ain't gonna make it. I've seen it  a million times. He's a goner. See?  Here they come. Lucky bastard. Could  have been the other ones. You never  know.
DOCTOR	m	Hurry, we're losing him.
MAN	m	What'd I tell you? Bingo!
DOCTOR	m	He's gone.
SAM	m	Who are you? What's happening...?
SAM	m	No!
SAM	m	Oh God, help me.
MINISTER	m	As we say farewell to our friend Sam  Wheat, we are reminded of his  kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy  of spirit...
MINISTER	m	All that we treasure, our friends,  our loved ones, our body, our mind,  are but on loan to us. We must  surrender them all. We are all  travelers on the same road which  leads to the same end.
MINISTER	m	As our loved one enters eternal life,  let us remember that love, too, is  eternal, that although we will miss  him, our love will light the void  and dispel the darkness.
SAM	m	Molly.
MINISTER	m	...and into Your hands we commend  his spirit. May he rest in peace. In  the name of the Father, the Son, and  the Holy Ghost. Amen.
VOICES	m	What time you going back to work?...  What's the buzz on Digital? It's  sad. He was so young... How's your  new Honda?... Going away this weekend?
MOLLY	f	Oh God, Sam...
MOLLY	f	I picked up your shirts this morning.  I don't know why. Mr. Reynolds said  to tell you hello. I broke into tears.  It's so hard...
MOLLY	f	I think about you every minute. It's  like you're still here, like I can  feel you, Sam.
SAM	m	I am here, Moll. I am.
MOLLY	f	Frank, what's wrong? Frank?
MOLLY	f	Sam?
SAM	m	Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my  favorite...
SAM	m	Molly, don't.
SAM	m	Say something. Help her, Carl.
CARL	m	It's hard. It's very hard.
SAM	m	Oh good. That's really good.
MOLLY	f	Sam's address book.
CARL	m	Dave Brubeck. Newport '86. Should I  toss 'em?
MOLLY	f	No!
SAM	m	Molly, we hated that concert.
CARL	m	Oh, you want to save those?
SAM	m	Rolaids? What are you doin' Moll?
MOLLY	f	I miss him, Carl.
CARL	m	We all do.
MOLLY	f	Wait. Wait. Not that one.
CARL	m	Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I don't know  how that got in there.
CARL	m	Hey, Moll. Why don't you come? It's  like summer outside.
MOLLY	f	No.
CARL	m	Just for a stroll. It'd be good to  get out.
MOLLY	f	I can't do it Carl.
CARL	m	Molly... you're not the one who died!
MOLLY	f	Okay. Just a short walk.
CARL	m	Thata girl.
SAM	m	Hey, Molly! Wait!
SAM	m	"Singing bye bye, Miss American Pie.  Drove my Chevy to the levy, but the  levy was dry. Them good ol' boys  were drinkin' whiskey and rye, and  singing this'll be the day that I..."
SAM	m	You motherfucking bastard! What the  hell are you doing here? What are  you doing?
SAM	m	Molly, no! Get out!
MOLLY	f	Frank, what's wrong?
GHOST	m	Stay off! This is mine!
SAM	m	Damn!
WILLIE	m	She came home. I couldn't get it.  Give me a couple of days. I'll go  back.
SAM	m	Get what? Who the hell are you? What  were you doing at Molly's? What the  hell's going on?
SAM	m	Stay away from her!
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Sorry 'bout that.
WOMAN	f	Rosa Santiago.
WOMAN	f	Please be seated.
CLARA	f	My sister will be with us soon.
LOUISE	f	Sister Oda Mae. Grant us the gift of  your all-seeing presence. Appear for  us now.
ODA MAE	f	Mrs. Santiago.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Buenos dias.
ODA MAE	f	I understand you are hoping to contact  your husband.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Si. Si.
ODA MAE	f	Well, I believe he's gonna be with  us today.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Oh, tsank you, tsank you.
ODA MAE	f	But there's no telling about the  other world. You gotta cast out all  doubt. You gotta believe. Do you  believe?
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Si. Si. I believe. I believe.
ODA MAE	f	And remember, we don't make no  promises. I can phone up there till  I'm blue in the face, ...but it don't necessarily mean  he's gonna be home. Them folks go  shopping, they play bingo. It's just  like here. You can't always get 'em.
SAM	m	Sure lady!
ODA MAE	f	Okay, let's get ready then.
ODA MAE	f	We got a problem here. I don't think  he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did  he know someone who's passed over,  someone named Anna... Mary...  Consuela... Maria?
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Si, si! His mama. She's Maria.
ODA MAE	f	Ah! I knew it. He's with his mama.
SAM	m	Oh my God...
ODA MAE	f	I'm afraid this is gonna be too hard.  Now I got two souls I gotta contact.  I don't know about that. It's  difficult, you know. The pain. The  effort.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	I pay more. How much? How much?
ODA MAE	f	Twenty dollars.
SAM	m	Way to go. Milk her for every penny.
CLARA/LOUISE	?	Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
CLARA/LOUISE	?	Have mercy! Have mercy!
ODA MAE	f	Welcome, Rosa Santiago. You are  fortunate today. The channel is clear.  Many spirits are gathering.
SAM	m	Yeah? Where?
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	My husband?
ODA MAE	f	I can feel his vibration. Yes, yes,  he is drawing toward us now. I can  see him coming.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Julio! Julio! How is he? How does he  look?
ODA MAE	f	Oh, he is a very handsome man.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Handsome?
ODA MAE	f	In our Father's Kingdom we are all  handsome.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Julio!
ODA MAE	f	He is standing before me. He is  wearing a black suit.
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was  buried in that.
SAM	m	What a crock of shit!
ODA MAE	f	Who's there?
ODA MAE	f	Where are you?
SAM	m	Who?
MRS. SANTIAGO	f	Julio! Julio!
SAM	m	What's going on?
ODA MAE	f	Get out of here! Leave me alone!
SAM	m	Who are you talking to?
ODA MAE	f	Keep him away!
SAM	m	Are you talking to me?
ODA MAE	f	Do something. Help me.
SAM	m	I don't believe this. Hey you. My  name is Sam Wheat. Can you hear me?  Sam Wheat!
ODA MAE	f	Stop it!
SAM	m	Say my name! Sam Wheat! Say it!
CLARA	f	Talk to me, Oda Mae. Say something.
ODA MAE	f	Sam Wheat!
SAM	m	Jesus!
CLARA	f	Samweet?
CLARA/LOUISE	?	Oda Mae! Oda Mae!
ODA MAE	f	Lord, I swear, no more cheatin'. I  promise, Lord. I don't want to go to  hell. I'll do anything. Gimme a  penance. Just make him go away.
SAM	m	Go away. Hell no. I'm stayin' right  here!
ODA MAE	f	My mama, her mama, may they rest in  peace, they had de gift. Mama always  said I had it, but I never did. She  tol' me all about it, how it felt  an' all. But now that it's happenin'  I don't know what to do. You're  scarin' me half to death. Please,  you gotta go away, you gotta find  someone else.
SAM	m	Someone else? Are you outta your  mind?
ODA MAE	f	I'm gettin' there fast. Leave me alone.
SAM	m	Not till you help me.
ODA MAE	f	Where are you?
LOUISE	f	Where? I'm right here.
SAM	m	I'm standing right beside you.
ODA MAE	f	"I'm standing right beside you." Are you white?
SAM	m	What?
ODA MAE	f	Oh God, I knew it. He's white. Why  me?
SAM	m	Listen, damn it. You can help me.  There's a woman, Molly Jensen. She's  in terrible danger. The man who killed  me broke into our apartment. He's  going to go back. You've gotta warn  her.
ODA MAE	f	Why would she listen to me?
SAM	m	She has to! This man's a killer!  He's got a key.
ODA MAE	f	Forget it, mister. I can't.
SAM	m	It's just a phone call. You're all  I've got. Lookit. I'm not leavin'  till you help me. I don't sleep  anymore, so I can sit here day and  night. I don't care how long it takes.  I can talk forever.
MOLLY	f	Hello.
ODA MAE 	f	Molly? Is this Molly speaking?
MOLLY	f	Yes.
ODA MAE 	f	My name is Oda Mae. I'm a spiritual  reader and adviser. I'm calling for a friend of yours.  He asked me to call. This is  important. You gotta believe me.  Don't be afraid.
MOLLY	f	Who is this?
ODA MAE 	f	I got a message from Sam.
MOLLY	f	What?
ODA MAE 	f	Sam Wheat. He asked me to call.
ODA MAE	f	What'd I tell you.
SAM	m	You gotta go there.
ODA MAE	f	Look, I don't care what you do to  me, I'm not goin' nowhere.
SAM	m	"I'm Henery the Eighth I am / Henery  the Eighth I am, I am / I'm gettin'  married to the widow next door /  She's been married seven times before  / And every one was an Henery /  Wouldn't take a Willie or a Sam /  I'm her eighth old man I'm Henery /  Henery the Eighth I am, I am / Henery  the Eighth I am / Second verse same  as the first / I'm Henery the Eighth  I am..."
ODA MAE	f	Okay! Okay! I'll go. You just shut  your mouth.
ODA MAE	f	I can't believe I'm doin' this. I  gotta be a crazy lady goin' into the  city with you. I never go there.  What the hell you doin' in my life,  huh? Why me?
ODA MAE	f	There's nobody there.
SAM	m	Just wait.
ODA MAE	f	No, sir. I did what I promised. I  said I'd come and I'm here. I didn't  say anything 'bout waitin'.
SAM	m	Just one more time. Please. It's a  big place.
SAM	m	"Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the  wall, ninety nine bottles of beer,"
MOLLY 	f	Hello, who's there?
ODA MAE	f	Don't go away. It's Oda Mae Brown. I  called you last night. Your friend  Sam says you gotta talk to me.
ODA MAE 	f	Hey you, Molly! You gotta listen to  me! this is for real. Sam is here.  He needs to talk to you.
ODA MAE 	f	He says remember the starfish at  Montego Bay? Remember the picture he  took a' you in Reno? Remember his green underwear, the  pair you wrote your name on? She  wrote her name on 'em?
ODA MAE	f	Hey, do you mind? This here's a  private conversation.
SAM	m	Ask her about the sweater in the  closet, the one she knitted that's  too big.
ODA MAE	f	What about the sweater you knitted  that was too big?
SAM	m	Four sizes.
ODA MAE	f	Four sizes.
SAM	m	She couldn't throw it out. I saw. I  was there.
ODA MAE	f	You couldn't throw it out. He saw.  He was there. This is for real. Hey  do you hear me up there?
WORKMAN	m	I hear you.
ODA MAE	f	I'm not talkin' to you.
WORKMAN	m	Haven't you ever heard of phones?
ODA MAE	f	Kiss my behind! Listen, I'm not gonna stand here all  day.
WORKMAN	m	Thank God.
ODA MAE	f	Forget it. I've had enough of this.
ODA MAE	f	Molly? I'm Oda Mae Brown. You can call me Oda.
MOLLY	f	Why should I believe you? Why should  I believe any of this?
ODA MAE	f	Girl, if you think I'd come down  here for the fun of it, you got  another think comin'. This Sam of  yours... I don't know, lady. I mean,  you ever hear a whole night of "Henry  the Eighth I am?"
MOLLY	f	He did that? That's how he got me to  go out with him.
ODA MAE	f	And he cain't carry a tune.
MOLLY	f	I know. Oh God. This is all so crazy.  I can't believe I'm talking to you  like this. I don't believe in these  things. I don't believe in life after  death.
SAM	m	Tell her she's wrong.
ODA MAE	f	He says you're wrong.
MOLLY	f	You're talking to him right now?
ODA MAE	f	What? You think I'm makin' it up?
MOLLY	f	Where is he?
ODA MAE	f	How should I know? It's not like I  can see him. I just hear his voice.
SAM	m	I'm holding her hand.
ODA MAE	f	He says he's holding your hand.
MOLLY	f	I'm sorry. I don't believe you. Why  are you doing this to me? I don't  believe a word you're saying. Sam is  dead. He's dead.
SAM	m	I'm holding her hand.
ODA MAE	f	He says he's holding your hand.
SAM	m	God, I love her. I love her so much.
ODA MAE	f	He says he loves you... so much.
MOLLY	f	No. He would never say that.
SAM	m	Ditto. Tell her "ditto".
ODA MAE	f	Ditto? What's that mean, ditto?
MOLLY	f	Sam?
ODA MAE	f	To tell the truth, I don't know how  I'm doin' it. In fack, confidentially,  nothin' like this never happened to  me before. Now, all a sudden, I can't  turn it off. Is this you? Is this him?
ODA MAE	f	Hazel eyes, huh? You sound like they'd  be blue.
MOLLY	f	I don't understand. Why did he come  back? Why is he still here?
ODA MAE	f	Cause he's stuck, that's why. He's  between worlds. It happens sometimes,  when their spirits get out too quick.  He thinks he still has stuff t'do  down here.
SAM	m	Come on Oda Mae, stop rambling.
ODA MAE	f	Oh, oh, now he's got an attitude.
SAM	m	I do not have an attitude.
ODA MAE	f	We're having a discussion. Whataya mean, you're not angry? If  you weren't angry you wouldn't be  raisin' your voice like that.
SAM	m	Goddamn it, Oda Mae!
ODA MAE	f	Ah ah, baby. That does it. I don't  talk to anybody who takes the Lord's  name in vain.
SAM	m	Relax, Oda Mae.
ODA MAE	f	You relax. You're the dead one. You  want my help, then you apologize.  Nobody talks to me like that,  understand?
SAM	m	Jesus Christ!
ODA MAE	f	Excuse me, girl. Time for me to go.
MOLLY	f	I don't believe I'm watching this.
SAM	m	Damn it. All right. I apologize.
SAM	m	Please, Oda Mae, I need you to tell  Molly what I'm saying. You gotta  tell her word for word.
ODA MAE	f	Monsieur has a message for you.
SAM	m	Molly, you're in danger.
ODA MAE	f	You can't tell her like that. And  would you stop movin' all over the  place? You're makin' me sick.
SAM	m	Say it!
ODA MAE	f	He's sayin' you're in danger.
MOLLY	f	Danger?... What do you mean?
SAM	m	I know the man who killed me. Willie  Lopez. I know where he lives.
ODA MAE	f	He says he knows the man who killed  him, Willie Lopez. He's Puerto Rican.
SAM	m	Write it down.
ODA MAE	f	Write it down.
SAM	m	You do it!
ODA MAE	f	Now I'm a secretary.
SAM	m	321 Prospect Place. Apartment 4D.
ODA MAE	f	321? Hey, that's my neighborhood.
SAM	m	Molly, he's got my wallet and my  key. He was in here.
ODA MAE	f	He's got his wallet and key. He was  in here.
MOLLY	f	In here?
SAM	m	You have to go to the police. The  Mugger wasn't acting alone. It was a  setup, Moll. I was murdered.
ODA MAE	f	He says he was set up, that he was  murdered. He wants you to go to the  police.
ODA MAE	f	I'm sorry. I don't want nothin' to  do with this.
SAM	m	Where you going?
ODA MAE	f	Don't follow me! I've done all I'm  gonna do. I'm finished. And I ain't comin'  back. So don't you come botherin' me  again cause it's over. I mean it.  This is it. Have a nice life. Have a  nice death. I'm goin'.
CARL	m	Molly, there's no one on earth who'd  like it to be true more than me, but  you've got to be rational about this.  I understand your desire to hold on  to him, but this... this is absurd.
MOLLY	f	It was real, Carl. She was real.
SAM	m	Listen to her, Carl, goddamn it. She  needs some support here.
CARL	m	Molly, you're a grown woman. How can  you believe some fortune teller from  Brooklyn...?
MOLLY	f	She was in touch with him.
CARL	m	I don't believe it, Molly. Not for a  minute.
SAM	m	Come on, Carl. Open your mind.
MOLLY	f	Carl, she knew things.
CARL	m	What kind of things?
MOLLY	f	I told you, the picture in Reno, the  starfish,... damn it, Carl. She said Sam knew who killed him.  That he was set up... murdered.
CARL	m	Oh boy. This is getting deranged.  We're going off the deep end here.
SAM	m	Give him the address, Moll.
MOLLY	f	She had a name, an address -- Willie  Lopez, 321 Prospect Place. She said  he had Sam's wallet.
CARL	m	This is sick. This is really sick.  How can you swallow this crap? Who  knows if this guy exists? Maybe she's  just setting someone up.
MOLLY	f	That's what I have to find out.
CARL	m	Find out? What are you talking about?
MOLLY	f	Sam wants me to go to the police.
CARL	m	Sam wants you to go to the police?  Molly! Jesus! Are you outta your  mind? What are you gonna tell 'em?  Some storefront psychic's been getting  messages from the dead? Do you know  how that sounds? You're talkin' ghosts  here, for God's sake.
CARL	m	I'm sorry. This stuff just really  gets to me.
MOLLY	f	You don't believe me. You don't  believe any of this, do you?
CARL	m	I'm trying to, but... Look, if it'll  make you sleep any better, I'll check  it out, okay? Now why don't you go  to bed. Try and get some sleep.
SAM	m	Way to go, Carl!
WILLIE	m	Carl, what're you doin' here?
CARL	m	Who've you been talking to?
WILLIE	m	Talking to? What the hell do you  mean? What's going on?
CARL	m	Some woman knows all about you. The  murder, everything. Where's she  getting it from, huh?
WILLIE	m	What the hell are you talking about?  I haven't said a word.
CARL	m	She knows your name, goddamn it! She  knows where you live!
WILLIE	m	A lot of women know where I live.
CARL	m	This isn't a joke, man. You find  that bitch, whoever she is, and...  get rid of her, you hear me? I've  got four million dollars stuck in  that fucking computer. If I don't  get those codes, if that money's not  transferred soon, I'm dead. If I  lose Balistrari's money, we're both  dead.
WILLIE	m	Tell him you only wash dirty money  on the first of the month.
CARL	m	What is wrong with you? Is everything  a joke? You were supposed to steal  his wallet. You weren't supposed to  kill him. Was that a joke?
WILLIE	m	I did you a favor. Freebee.
CARL	m	Jesus! These are drug dealers, man. Don't blow this for me, Willie. I've  risked my job here. I could go to  jail. A hundred thousand of that  money goes to me. Now give me Sam's  key. I'll get that address book  myself.
SAM	m	You killed me, Carl. You had me  killed. Look what you've done to me!  Look what you've done!
SAM	m	You fucker! You mother fucker! I had  a life, Goddamn you. I had a life!
MOLLY	f	You white fascist bigot. Who do you  think you are? Bed Stuy's part of  New York, you know. This is America.
WOMAN	f	Hey, Snow, you lost or sumpin'?
MOLLY	f	Look, you've gotta believe me. I  don't even believe this stuff, myself.  But this is real. Do you think I'd  come here if it wasn't real? You  told me to come if I had any new  information. Well, here I am.
MOLLY	f	Don't look at me like that. You guys  use psychics all the time.
MOLLY	f	Damn it. I know how this sounds. I  hear myself saying it and I want to  cringe. But this woman knew things  she couldn't have known, intimate  details.
WALLACE	m	How intimate?
MOLLY	f	Things Sam only said to me.
WALLACE	m	Okay, let me get this straight.  According to this psychic lady, there  are ghosts and spirits all over the  place, watching us all the time,  huh?... I'm sorry. I've got important things  to do.
MOLLY	f	I'm telling you. The killer's name  is Willie Lopez. I've got his address.  You've got to check it out.
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	Okay. You just wait here. Let me see  if this guy's got a record.
MOLLY	f	What are you doing? Where's your  file on Willie Lopez?
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	There's no file for a Willie Lopez.  He was probably some old boyfriend  she was trying to get even with.  This psychic woman's record goes  back a long way. Fraud, numbers  rackets, you name it. She's a real  pro.
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	1967. Shreveport, Louisiana. Forgery,  selling false ID. Served one year.  1971. Baton Rouge. Arrested for fraud,  numbers racketeering. Served ten  months. 1974. Hattiesburg,  Mississippi. Fraud, seven months.  1984. Albany, New York. Petty larceny.  It goes on and on.
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	This woman's a charlatan. You can't  believe anything she said.
MOLLY	f	This isn't possible. There were words,  private things. How could she have  known all that?
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	They have ways.
MOLLY	f	Ways? What ways?
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	They've got a million cons. A lot of  times they read the obits. All she  had to do was see the word "banker".  Hell, they even go through your  garbage to find things they can use,  letters, old papers. They don't need  much.
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	I bet you threw stuff out, huh? It  could have been anything. What about  that underwear she knew all about?
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	Green underwear. I'll bet she zeroed  right in on that.
MOLLY	f	No! She was real. She said things.  She knew about a sweater I knitted,  about songs we sang... She knew about  this place we went, Montego Bay...
SGT. BEIDERMAN	?	I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People  want so much to believe. They're  grieving, vulnerable. They'd give  anything for one last moment... money,  insurance policies. Believe me, these  people know what they're doing. Look,  I know how you must feel. You know,  you can press charges.
MOLLY	f	Oh God, I wanted it to be Sam.
CARL	m	God, let this be it!
CARL	m	Oh God, yes!
CARL	m	Tony, this is Carl. I'm all set.  We're fine. Everything's fine. Just  tell me what you want me to do.
VOICE	m	We want you to transfer the money  from the 12 separate accounts into a  single account under the name "Rita  Miller". Tomorrow, at five minutes  before closing, 3:55 p. m., transfer  the full account to First Island  Bank of Nassau, registry number 486-
VOICE	m	Call us when it's done.
CARL	m	Tell Mr. Balistrari there won't be  any problems.
VOICE	m	I'll do that.
SAM	m	Why can't you hear me, Molly? I need  you.
MOLLY	f	Who's there?
CARL	m	Molly, it's Carl. Can I come up?
SAM	m	Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!
CARL	m	Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm  sorry to disturb you. I felt bad  about last night. This supernatural  stuff just makes me so uncomfortable.  I don't even read horoscopes.
MOLLY	f	Don't worry. It's okay.
CARL	m	No it's not. You needed me to hear  you and I didn't and that was wrong.  I want you to know that I'm your  friend, Moll.
SAM	m	You were never our friend.
CARL	m	Hey, I brought you some Japanese  apple pears. I know you like them.
MOLLY	f	Oh, that's so sweet.
CARL	m	Listen, can I come in for a minute?  I won't stay long. I've had one of  those days. Maybe a cup of coffee?
SAM	m	No, Moll. Don't do it. Don't let him  in!
MOLLY	f	Sure.
MOLLY	f	Are you alright? You look nervous,  upset.
CARL	m	What can I tell you. It's been tough.  Hell, you know. It still hurts so  much. Then on top of it all... it's the  responsibilities. They've given me  my own accounts, but I've had no  time to adjust. My mind has been  reeling.
CARL	m	Where were you this morning? I thought  you were coming to the bank to sign  those papers.
MOLLY	f	I didn't have time. I went to the police, Carl.
CARL	m	You're kidding. You really did it? I  don't believe... What did you tell  them? What did they say?
MOLLY	f	You were right, you know. I felt  like such a fool. They brought out a  file on this psychic woman ten inches  thick. It was awful.
CARL	m	A ripoff artist, huh?
SAM	m	Molly, no.
MOLLY	f	The sad part is that I believed her.  I believed her, Carl. It was all a sham.
CARL	m	Sometimes we need to believe.
MOLLY	f	Why?... I was a fool. I don't believe  anything anymore. Why would people  do such things?
CARL	m	It's hard to face reality, Moll, the  hard cold facts of it. What you have  to remember is the love you felt.  That's what's real. You have to  remember how good Sam was. How much  he loved you.
CARL	m	You were everything to him, Molly.  You were his life.
MOLLY	f	I feel so alone.
CARL	m	You're not alone. You're young. You've  got so much talent. You're  fantastically gorgeous.
MOLLY	f	Oh God, I don't know what's real  anymore. I don't know what to think.
CARL	m	Just think about Sam. Think about  what he meant to you, the years you  had together, how wonderful they  were.
CARL	m	Let your feelings out.
CARL	m	Life turns on a dime, Moll. People  think they have forever, that they'll  always have tomorrow. But it's not  true. Sam taught us that. We have to  live for now, for today.
SAM	m	No!!!
MOLLY	f	I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. It's  too soon... You've been great Carl,  but... I need you to leave. Please.  I need you to.
CARL	m	Sure. It's okay. I understand. I  really do.
CARL	m	Look, what if we have dinner tomorrow  night? Just talk. Can I interest you  in that?
SAM	m	NO!!!
GHOST	m	Get off my train!
SAM	m	Teach me how you do that! I want to  learn! I'm not leaving til you teach  me!
GHOST	m	You stubborn asshole.
GHOST	m	What are you doing? What are you  doing? You can't push it with your  finger. You're dead.
SAM	m	I don't get it.
GHOST	m	It's your mind, you idiot. It's all  in the mind. The problem is you think  you're still real, that you're  standin' on the floor, that you're  wearin' those clothes. Bullshit! You  don't even have a body anymore. It's  all up here. You wanna move things,  you gotta use your mind. You gotta  focus! You hear what I'm saying?
SAM	m	How do you focus?
GHOST	m	I don't know how you focus! You just  focus!
GHOST	m	It's all in the anger. You gotta  direct it. You gotta channel it.
SAM	m	I'm angry all the time. It doesn't  do a thing.
GHOST	m	Cause you're angry all over. You  gotta be angry here, in the pit of  your stomach. Bring it down here.  Let it explode. It's like a reactor, you know. Pow!
SAM	m	I did it!
GHOST	m	Way to go.
GHOST	m	From your gut. What do I keep tellin'  you?
GHOST	m	Give it time! What else have you  got?
SAM	m	How long have you been here?
GHOST	m	Since they pushed me.
SAM	m	Someone pushed you?
GHOST	m	Yeah, someone pushed me!
SAM	m	Who?
GHOST	m	What? You don't believe me? You think  I fell? You think I jumped? Well,  fuck you! It wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed  to go! I'm not supposed to be here!
GHOST	m	I'd give everything for a drag. Just  one drag.
GHOST	m	Who the hell are you? Why are you  hounding me like this? Leave me alone.
SAM	m	What the hell?
ODA MAE	f	Sam?
SAM	m	What is all this? What's goin' on?
ODA MAE	f	What'd you do, tell every spook in  town about me? I got spooks from out  of town here. There's stuff goin' on  you wouldn't believe. I can't hardly  believe it myself.
SAM	m	Oda Mae. You're doing it. This is  for real. How do you like that?
ODA MAE	f	I don't.
SAM	m	Come on. Look at this. You're doing  great.
GHOST	m	Can you hurry this up? My husband's  in the waiting room.
SAM	m	I need your help, Oda Mae. There's  something we need to do.
ODA MAE	f	Forget it. I'm not doin' anything.  You're holdin' on to a life that  don't want you no more. Give it up.
SAM	m	Give it up? I'm already dead.
ODA MAE	f	Dead, yeah, but you ain't finished  dyin'. Give up the ghost.
SAM	m	And how am I supposed to do that?
ODA MAE	f	You're asking me?
ORTISHA	?	Are you speaking to me?
ODA MAE	f	Does it look like I'm speakin' to  you? So, are you gonna leave or not? I've  got work to do.
ODA MAE	f	What's a matter? You're supposed to  be concentrating. How do you expect  me to do this if you're not  concentrating? Okay then. You ready?  Let's do it.
ODA MAE	f	Oh, Lord! Stop! Whatcha doin' to me?
ORLANDO	m	Ortisha?!
ORTISHA	?	Orlando! Is that you?
ORLANDO	m	Ortisha, where are you? I can't see  too good.
RELATIVES	?	Here! She's here!
ORTISHA	?	In front of you! I'm right here!
ORLANDO	m	Mother of God, what've you done to  your hair!?
ORTISHA	?	Orlando, do you like it? It's Autumn  Sunrise.
ODA MAE	f	Get out of here, you little shit!
ODA MAE	f	Lord oh Lord, don't you ever do that  to me!
ORTISHA	?	Orlando!?
ORLANDO	m	What happened to me? I can barely  move.
GHOST	m	You should know better than to try  that. It's not worth it. It'll wipe  you out for days.
SAM	m	That was incredible, Oda Mae.
ODA MAE	f	Never again. Never.
ORTISHA	?	Where's Orlando?
SAM	m	He spoke through you. It was amazing.
ODA MAE	f	No more, uh uh, no more.
ORTISHA	?	What happened to Orlando? Where'd he  leave the insurance policy?
SAM	m	You're great, Oda Mae! You're a real  medium. It's what you were born for.
ODA MAE	f	I want everybody out.
ORTISHA	?	Orlando?
ODA MAE	f	Now!
SAM	m	Oda Mae, what's wrong?
ODA MAE	f	Out! I said out! That means you,  too!
CLARA	f	Oda Mae, there's a man here who says  he has to see you right away.
ODA MAE	f	I ain't seein' nobody.
WILLIE	m	Are you the one that can talk to the  dead?
ODA MAE	f	I beg your pardon! I'm not seeing  customers right now.
WILLIE	m	I said I need to know if you're the  one.
ODA MAE	f	I'm the one. But not now.
WILLIE	m	This is important. I have a friend.  He died recently. Some say he was  mugged. I think he was murdered.
WILLIE	m	I'm told you can contact people like  that. Is that true?
ODA MAE	f	It's been known to happen. But it's  not gonna happen now, so come back  later.
WILLIE	m	I can't wait til later.
ODA MAE	f	What's your friend's name?
WILLIE	m	Good question. Why don't you tell  me?
WILLIE	m	You're the psychic, right?
ODA MAE	f	This ain't no guessin' game.
WILLIE	m	Then what is it, lady?
ODA MAE	f	Lookit, I don't know what your trouble  is... Who are you?
WILLIE	m	You're the mindreader. I hear you've  been tellin' people about me for  days. What's my name?
SAM	m	Willie!
ODA MAE	f	Willie!?
WILLIE	m	How'd you know that?
ODA MAE	f	Because I'm psychic.
ODA MAE	f	He tried to kill me! Why? Why?
ODA MAE	f	Talk to me!
SAM	m	Oda Mae, we're in trouble...
ODA MAE	f	We're in trouble? Who's we? You're  already dead.
SAM	m	I can stop them. But I can't do it  alone. You've gotta help me.
ODA MAE	f	Help you? It's me they're tryin' to  kill.
SAM	m	You're right. And they'll be back.  I'm your only chance.
ODA MAE	f	Why don't you go find a haunted house  and rattle some chains.
SAM	m	I need you Oda Mae. I need you to  get some fake ID's.
ODA MAE	f	Fake ID's? What for?
SAM	m	Help me now, they'll never bother  you again. I promise.
ODA MAE	f	Help you? Whataya talking about  exactly? What else do I have to do?
ODA MAE	f	This is crazy. This ain't gonna work.  I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'.
SAM	m	I'll teach you. You'll learn fast.
SAM	m	See where it says "New Accounts"?  That's where you're going.
ODA MAE	f	I'm not givin' 'em any money.
SAM	m	Just do what I say.
OFFICER	m	Can I help you?
SAM	m	Tell her you're here to fill out a  signature card for a new account.
ODA MAE	f	I'm here to fill out a signature  card for a new account.
OFFICER	m	And do you know your account number?
SAM	m	Yes. 926-31043.
ODA MAE	f	Yes. 926-31043.
SAM	m	Rita Miller.
ODA MAE	f	Who?
OFFICER	m	What?
SAM	m	Tell her Rita Miller.
ODA MAE	f	Rita Miller.
OFFICER	m	Didn't they have you sign a card  when you opened the account?
SAM	m	Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for  you by phone and asked you to come  in today.
ODA MAE	f	Carl Bruner opened it for me. He  asked me to come in today.
OFFICER	m	Ah.
SAM	m	Just sign you name at the bottom on  the first blank line.
SAM	m	No, no, no. Rita Miller.
ODA MAE	f	Can I have another one please? I  signed the wrong name.
SAM	m	Tell her to see that it goes right  up to the third floor file since you  have a transaction to make.
ODA MAE	f	I need you to put that in the third  floor file cause I got a transfusion  to make.
OFFICER	m	A what?
ODA MAE	f	You know what I mean. Umm, can I keep the pen?
OFFICER	m	...uh, sure.
ODA MAE	f	Thanks.
CARL	m	Hello. Carl Bruner speaking.
VOICE	m	Carl?
CARL	m	Mr. Balsitrari
VOICE	m	Balistrari? Carl, it's me, John.  I've got the info on the Bradley  portfolio.
CARL	m	Oh yeah, yeah. That's great. I'll  pick it up later.
SAM	m	Tell the guard you're here to see  Lyle Furgeson.
ODA MAE	f	Lyle Furgeson, please.
GUARD	m	Do you have an appointment?
ODA MAE	f	No. I'm here for the fun of it.
SAM	m	Don't say that! Tell him Rita Miller's  here.
ODA MAE	f	Tell him Rita Miller's here.
GUARD	m	Just one moment, please.
SAM	m	Don't embellish.
ODA MAE	f	Yes, Sir.
GUARD	m	Excuse me?
SAM	m	Now listen, this guy Furgeson's a  real jerk.
ODA MAE	f	Why are you whispering?
SAM	m	Just be quiet and listen. I've known  him five years and he still thinks  my name's Paul.
SAM	m	He's a social moron. You don't have  to worry about anything. Tell the  guard Furgeson knows you. You spent  time with him and his wife Shirley  at the Brewster's Christmas party  last year.
GUARD	m	What is this regarding?
ODA MAE	f	What? He doesn't remember me? We  were together at the Brewster's  Christmas party. With his wife  Shirley. They had that lovely tree...  all those presents. Why, I'll never  forget all those beautiful...
ODA MAE	f	Oops. Gas.
SAM	m	This'll be easy. Furgeson was so  drunk at that party, he could have  had a conversation with Tina Turner  and he wouldn't remember.
FURGESON	?	Hello, hello. Of course, of course.  It's been so long.
ODA MAE	f	A long time.
SAM	m	Ask how Bobby and Snooky are.
ODA MAE	f	How are Bobby and Snooky doin'?
FURGESON	?	Why, they're just fine, thank you.  Nice of you to ask. And how is your...  family?
ODA MAE	f	Couldn't be better.
FURGESON	?	Well, isn't that wonderful.
SAM	m	Tell him you've been wondering how  they did on the Gibraltar securities.
ODA MAE	f	So tell me, Fergie, how did you do  on the Gibraltar securities?
FURGESON	?	The Gibraltar securities! Well, it  looks like we topped out, huh?
SAM	m	"We sure did!"
ODA MAE	f	We sure did.
FURGESON	?	That was a wonderful tip.
SAM	m	"Good old Randy".
ODA MAE	f	Good old Randy. Got a real head on  his shoulders.
SAM	m	"Her" shoulders.
ODA MAE	f	"Her" shoulders.
FURGESON	?	Sure does. Well... well. So what  brings you here today?
SAM	m	You're closing an account.
ODA MAE	f	I'm closing an account.
FURGESON	?	Well... wonderful. Do you have your  account number?
SAM	m	926-31043.
ODA MAE	f	926-3143.
SAM	m	31-0-43.
ODA MAE	f	Make that 31-0-43... Numbers. I'm  dyslexic.
FURGESON	?	Well, Rita, you'll be withdrawing  four million dollars from us today,  is that correct?
ODA MAE	f	Four million dollars?!
SAM	m	Say "yes"!
ODA MAE	f	Yes! Four million. That's right.  That's right.
FURGESON	?	And how will you want that?
ODA MAE	f	Tens and twenties?
FURGESON	?	Pardon?
SAM	m	A cashier's check! Tell him a  cashier's check.
ODA MAE	f	A cashier's check.
FURGESON	?	Fine. Of course, you realize we're  required to get some identification  from everyone. It's just procedural.  You understand.
ODA MAE	f	Of course.
ODA MAE	f	You know, if you put that Brillo pad  in the freezer, it'll last twice as  long.
SECRETARY 	f	Yes, Mr. Bruner.
CARL	m	Get me the First Island Bank of  Nassau. It's on the rolodex.
FURGESON	?	I'll just need your signature right  here.
ODA MAE	f	Sure.
SAM	m	Sign Rita Miller.
SAM	m	I'll be back in a minute. You're on  your own. Don't say anything foolish.
FURGESON	?	Now you be careful with this. It's  like carrying cash, you know.
ODA MAE	f	I sure do.
ODA MAE	f	Then my mother took all the money  from the oil wells and put it in  gasoline pumps. Every gas station  has 'em you know, sometimes six or  more. It adds up.
SAM	m	Oda Mae, come on. We gotta get out  of here. Say goodbye.
ODA MAE	f	Well, I've got to leave. It's been a  pleasure doin' business with you.  Say "hi" to Shirley and Snooky for  me.
FURGESON	?	Thank you, Rita. I'll be glad to.
SAM	m	Hurry up, Oda Mae.
ODA MAE	f	What a day!
MOLLY	f	Lionel?
FURGESON	?	Molly. How are you?
MOLLY	f	Lionel, a woman who just left, a  black lady, about my height, did you  see her?
FURGESON	?	Well, yes. I just took care of her.
MOLLY	f	What did she want? Did it have  anything to do with me? Did she ask  about Sam?
FURGESON	?	Sam? No. Why?
MOLLY	f	Was her name Oda Mae Brown?
FURGESON	?	No, Rita Miller. She just closed an  account.
FURGESON	?	Is there a problem?
MOLLY	f	No. I guess not. Thanks.
LEEDEN	?	Carl, is something wrong?
CARL	m	Is someone playing with the computers?
LEEDEN	?	What?
CARL	m	Is this a joke? One of my accounts  is closed.
LEEDEN	?	Which account? What's wrong?
LEEDEN	?	You want me to call someone?
CARL	m	No, no. Never mind. It's okay. It's  all right. I can do it.
ODA MAE	f	$4,000,000. $4,000,000. Lord Almighty.
SAM	m	Oda Mae. Take the check out of your  purse.
ODA MAE	f	Take it out? Why?
SAM	m	Just do it.
SAM	m	Now endorse it. Sign Rita Miller.
ODA MAE	f	Endorse it? Why?
SAM	m	Do what I say.
ODA MAE	f	No!
SAM	m	That's blood money, Oda. I was killed  for that money. Endorse it now.
ODA MAE	f	What are you going to do with it?
SAM	m	We're giving it away.
ODA MAE	f	Away? What do you mean? To who?
SAM	m	Look to your left.
ODA MAE	f	Are you outta your mind?
SAM	m	Do what I tell you.
ODA MAE	f	No! I can't.
SAM	m	Yes, you can. If you don't do it,  they'll track you down. Your only  protection is to get rid of it, now.
ODA MAE	f	Sweet Jesus, you're killing me, Sam.
SAM	m	I'm saving you, Oda Mae. You'll go  to heaven for this.
SAM	m	Write "St. Joseph's Shelter".
NUN	f	Bless you, child.
SAM	m	I'm proud of you.
ODA MAE	f	Don't you talk to me. I don't want  you comin' round no more. I mean it.  Understand?
SAM	m	Come on, we're friends.
ODA MAE	f	Friends? Friends?
SAM	m	I think you're wonderful, Oda Mae.
SAM	m	Search, you bastard! You'll never  find it. It's gone. They'll kill you for this, Carl. You  and Willie. They'll wipe you off the  face of the earth.
CARL	m	What the...?
CARL	m	Who's doing that?
SAM	m	You bastard! You goddamn bastard!
CARL	m	Ah!
SAM	m	It's dinner time, Carl. Don't you  have a date with Molly, you creepy  son-of-a bitch?
CARL	m	Jesus! Oh God!
MOLLY	f	Carl? Where were you? I thought we  were having...?
CARL	m	I'm sorry. Things just got so crazy.  I completely forgot.
SAM	m	Old Carl had a little trouble at the  office.
MOLLY	f	Forgot? I was worried. Is everything  okay? Are you all right?
CARL	m	I'm okay. I'm alright. Look, can I  talk to you for minute? Can I come  in?
CARL	m	I need to ask you a question.
SAM	m	He needs to borrow four million  dollars.
CARL	m	Molly, I know what the police said,  but when you thought Sam was here,  when you thought he spoke to you,  what did you feel? What did he say?
MOLLY	f	Why? What happened?
CARL	m	Molly, that psychic woman, I want to  know what she told you. I want to  know what she said.
MOLLY	f	Carl, stop this. It was all a hoax.  I told you. It wasn't real. She's a  charlatan. Does this have anything to do with  her being at the bank today?
SAM	m	Oh shit!
CARL	m	At the bank?
MOLLY	f	I was sure I saw her. Furgeson says  she was taking out money. It turns  out her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown.  It's Rita Miller or something.
MOLLY	f	What's wrong?
CARL	m	Stomach. My stomach. Do you have  anything? Pepto Bismol.
MOLLY	f	Sure. Just a second. What's going  on?
CARL	m	What are you doing to me. Get away!  Get away!
CARL	m	You touch me again and I'll set her  on fire. I mean it. I'll kill her.  I'll blow up the whole building if I  have to. Stay away!
CARL	m	Go on, try it again. Let me see you  turn it off now.
CARL	m	Try and hurt me. I'll kill her if  you hurt me.
CARL	m	What's a matter? You believe me,  huh? You better believe me! I want  my money. I need that money and I  want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that  psychic lady doesn't bring it here,  Molly's dead.
MOLLY	f	Oh my God. Is that the gas?
CARL	m	You must have left the stove on.
CARL	m	Just glad I smelled it.
MOLLY	f	Me, too.
CARL	m	Molly, I'm sorry. I've got to go.  Look, there's something going on. I  can't talk now. Some trouble at the  bank.
MOLLY	f	Trouble? What kind of trouble? Is it  that woman, the psychic?
CARL	m	I don't have time to talk now. What  if I come back? Around 11:00?
MOLLY	f	Carl, what's going on? Let me help  you.
CARL	m	I can't. I'm sorry to do this, but  it's important. I'll be back.
CARL	m	Eleven!
ODA MAE	f	Sam!
CLARA	f	Not again!
ODA MAE	f	What're you doin' here?
SAM	m	Oda Mae! We're in trouble. They want  the check. They're comin' to kill  you. We gotta get outta here.
ODA MAE	f	The check? What do you mean, "the  check". You said they'd never find  out.
CLARA	f	What's happenin' Oda Mae?
SAM	m	It's them.
ODA MAE	f	They're comin' to kill me. What have you done?
SAM	m	They're heading for the door.
ODA MAE	f	Jesus have mercy.
ODA MAE	f	Emergency! Let us in!
WOMAN	f	Who you kiddin'?
ELDERLY WOMAN	f	What're you doin'? You can't come in  here. The cat don't like visitors.  She'll pee all over the couch. You  wanna pay for...
ODA MAE	f	They're gonna find us.
SAM	m	No they won't. I'm gonna get 'em.
ODA MAE	f	Oh yeah? And how you gonna do that?
SAM	m	Whataya mean? I'm a ghost, aren't I?
WILLIE	m	Looks like someone just left.
CARL	m	I'll check the building.
WILLIE	m	Damn!
WILLIE	m	Who's there? Who's doing that?
WILLIE	m	Oh God!
WILLIE	m	Let me outta here!
WILLIE	m	Help me!
CARL	m	Look out!
ODA MAE	f	Sam? What happened?
SAM	m	He's dead, Oda Mae.
ODA MAE	f	Dead! Oh, thank God. It's over.
SAM	m	No. It's not over, Oda Mae. There's  still Carl.
ODA MAE	f	Who's Carl?
SAM	m	Tell him to hurry!
ODA MAE	f	Can't you hurry up?
DRIVER	m	Listen, lady, I'm going as fast as I  can.
ODA MAE	f	Problems?
MOLLY	f	Carl, is that you?
ODA MAE	f	Molly, it's Oda Mae. I know what you  think of me, but your life is in  danger. You have to listen to me.  Sam's here, too. You gotta let us  in.
MOLLY	f	Get the hell out of here. I'm calling  the police.
ODA MAE	f	Go ahead. We want you to call 'em.  You're in trouble. Let us in.
MOLLY	f	No!
ODA MAE	f	Sam's death was no accident. He was  murdered, Molly. Carl was laundering  money at the bank. Sam found out.  He's dangerous. He tried to kill me.  He'll kill you, too.
MOLLY	f	Why are you doing this to me? Get  away from me! I know all about you.  You're a fake. You're just a fake.  Leave me alone!
SAM	m	Tell her she's wearing the blouse I  spilled the Margarita on and the  earrings I gave her for Christmas.
ODA MAE	f	Sam says you're wearin' the blouse  he spilled the Margarita on and the  earrings he gave you at Christmas.
ODA MAE 	f	See, I'm no fake.
MOLLY	f	Go away!
SAM	m	Gimme a penny quick.
ODA MAE	f	What?
SAM	m	Empty your purse. On the floor. Now.
SAM	m	Push a penny under the door.
SAM	m	Tell her it's for luck.
ODA MAE 	f	Sam says it's for luck.
MOLLY	f	Right. Yes, it's right on the corner.  We're a red brick building with the  entrance on the left side. Please  hurry. Thank you Sergeant. We'll be  waiting right here. Police are on their way.
MOLLY	f	What do we do now?
ODA MAE	f	Just wait.
MOLLY	f	Is Sam here?
SAM	m	I'm sitting beside you.
ODA MAE	f	Right here.
MOLLY	f	Can you feel me, Sam?
SAM	m	With all my heart.
ODA MAE	f	With all his heart, he says.
SAM	m	I'd give anything to be alive again,  just to feel you once more.
ODA MAE	f	He wishes he could touch you, just  one more time.
MOLLY	f	Oh, Sam.
ODA MAE	f	Okay, damn it, you can use me if you  want.
ODA MAE	f	Come on. Before I change my mind.
MOLLY	f	Sam!
MOLLY	f	I love you so much.
MOLLY	f	The police!
SAM	m	No!
ODA MAE	f	Wait!
SAM	m	What's happening to me?
CARL 	m	Molly, open up. It's me.
MOLLY	f	It's Carl!
SAM	m	Get out of here! The fire escape.
ODA MAE	f	Come with me.
CARL 	m	Molly. Open up. Are you there?
CARL	m	Molly!
ODA MAE	f	Back to the fire escape. Head for  the roof.
MOLLY	f	This way!
ODA MAE	f	Help us, Sam!
CARL	m	I want the check. Just give me the  check.
MOLLY	f	God almighty, Carl! What are you  doing? What have you done!?
CARL	m	Don't interfere! She's a thief. It's  not her money.
CARL	m	Keep out of this, Molly!
CARL	m	Where is it?
ODA MAE	f	In my purse.
CARL	m	Where?
ODA MAE	f	Over there.
CARL	m	Where is it, goddamn it? Where is  it?
ODA MAE	f	I gave it away.
CARL	m	You're lying! Don't lie to me!
CARL	m	I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll  kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give  me the check.
CARL	m	Sam, please. I didn't mean for him  to kill you. It's not my fault. Come  on, Sam, give me the check. Give it  to me and I'll leave her alone.
CARL	m	Sam? Sam?
CARL	m	Sam?
SAM	m	Goodbye, Moll.
MOLLY	f	Sam? Is that you?
SAM	m	Molly?!
MOLLY	f	I hear you, Sam.
MOLLY	f	Oh God!
SAM	m	I can't stay anymore.
ODA MAE	f	They're waiting for you, Sam.
SAM	m	I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae. Thank you. Your mama would be proud.
SAM	m	I love you, Molly. I've always loved  you.
MOLLY	f	Ditto.
SAM	m	It's so amazing, Moll...
SAM	m	The love inside.
SAM	m	You take it with you.
MOLLY	f	See ya.
