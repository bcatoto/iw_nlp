MRS. PRESCOTT	f	Why do they always put braces on  teenage girls at the exact moment  when they're the most self-conscious  about their appearance?
MR. PRESCOTT	m	I don't know.
MRS. PRESCOTT	f	Tom --
MR. PRESCOTT	m	I see him...
MRS. PRESCOTT	f	Tom!
MR. PRESCOTT	m	Jesus!
MRS. PRESCOTT	f	Tom!
SHERIFF	m	Hello, Amy.
AMY	f	Hi, Darryl.
SHERIFF	m	Amy, would you please tell the kids  you'll be right back, and then shut  the door and come outside to talk to  us for a minute?
AMY	f	OK.
SAMMY	m	You're not supposed to go out, Amy.
TERRY	m	She's going to smoke a cigarette.
SAMMY	m	Rudy, come on! I'm really late!
SAMMY	m	How was school?
RUDY	m	Stupid.
SAMMY	m	Why do you say that?
RUDY	m	We're supposed to write a story for  English homework, but they didn't  tell us what it's supposed to be  about.
SAMMY	m	What do you mean?
RUDY	m	I mean they didn't tell us what it's  supposed to be about. They said do  whatever you want.
SAMMY	m	So what's wrong with that?
RUDY	m	Nothing. I just think it's  unstructured.
SAMMY	m	Well, I'm sure you'll be able to  think of something. If you can't,  I'll help you.
SAMMY	m	Don't forget your backpack.
RUDY	m	It's not a backpack, it's a knapsack.
SAMMY	m	Don't forget your knapsack.
SAMMY	m	Give me a kiss.
MABEL	f	Guess who's been asking for you?
SAMMY	m	Oh no, really?
BRIAN	m	Yeah, come in!
SAMMY	m	Mr. Everett?
BRIAN	m	Yeah: Brian.
SAMMY	m	Brian. Hi. I'm Samantha Prescott --  I'm the lending officer?
BRIAN	m	Yeah, hi, how are you? Come on in.  Sit down.
SAMMY	m	I am so sorry I was late...
BRIAN	m	Yeah, we missed you before...
SAMMY	m	I got held up. Believe me, it is not  something I make a habit of...
BRIAN	m	I'm sure it's not. Actually -- could  you just, could you close that door  for me? Thanks.
SAMMY	m	-- so I always just run out at 3:15  to pick him up and then run him real  quick over to the sitter's house.  Anyway, Larry never minded about it  and I was just hoping it would be OK  with you too...
BRIAN	m	Well -- Samantha -- I realize that  Scottsville is not exactly a major  banking center...
SAMMY	m	No it's not...
BRIAN	m	No -- I know it's not... But it's  kind of a personal challenge to me  to see what we can do to bring local  service up to the same kinds of  standards we'd be trying to meet if  we were the biggest branch in the  state. And that means I don't want  anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30,  or whenever the bus happens to come  in that day. Now is there anybody  else who can pick your son up after  school? Does your husband work in  the area? Do you --
SAMMY	m	Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the  scene." So to speak.
BRIAN	m	Well, I can give you a couple of  days to make some other arrangement,  but...
SAMMY	m	Well -- Brian? I understand what  you're saying, and I think it's great.  I do. Because there's a lot of things  around here that could use some  attention. Believe me. But I've  honestly been meeting that bus every  day for four years now and it really  does take just fifteen minutes, and  if I take the time out of my lunch  hour...
BRIAN	m	I'd really prefer it if you would  make some other arrangement. OK?
SAMMY	m	I'll do my best...!
BRIAN	m	How old's your son?
SAMMY	m	He's eight.
BRIAN	m	That's a terrific age.
RUDY	m	You got a letter from Uncle Terry.
SAMMY	m	What?!
RUDY	m	Whose room is he gonna stay in?
SAMMY	m	He can stay in the little room. But you know what? He's not going to  live here. He's only gonna stay for  a little while... And it's OK if you  don't remember him, because you were  only six the last time he was here...  But it'll be nice if you got a chance  to get to know each other a little  bit. Don't you think?
SAMMY	m	Rudy? Would it distract you if I put  on some music?
RUDY	m	No.
SAMMY	m	Did you think of a story?
RUDY	m	Uh huh.
SAMMY	m	What's it about?
RUDY	m	My father.
SAMMY	m	What about your father?
RUDY	m	It's just a made-up story about him.
SAMMY	m	Can I read it when you're done?
RUDY	m	It's not very good.
SAMMY	m	Don't say that.
SAMMY	m	Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this  adventure story, and Rudy's father  is this secret agent or something,  working for the government... And it  just made me feel weird. You know?  Because I never really say much to  him about Rudy Sr., because I don't  know what to say. And I don't know  whether I should just let him imagine  whatever he wants to imagine, or  whether I should sit him down sometime  and tell him, you know, that his  father is not such a nice person.  You know?
BOB	m	Well... I don't know, Sammy. What  have you told him already?
SAMMY	m	Not much. He knows I don't have the  highest opinion of him. And he knows  I don't want to see him or know  anything about him, ever. But I tried  to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway...  I could go into a lot more detail,  believe me.
BOB	m	Well... It's an interesting problem.  But I don't really know what to tell  you... It's a little outside my  personal field of expertise...
SAMMY	m	All right.
BOB	m	I'd be glad to give it some thought...
SAMMY	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	What?
BOB	m	Nothing... I'm just glad to see you...  I'm glad you called me.
SAMMY	m	I bet you were surprised...!
BOB	m	Um -- a little.
SAMMY	m	I should get going...
BOB	m	Really?
SAMMY	m	Yeah... I've got the baby-sitter...  But... Thanks for a lovely evening.
BOB	m	Oh. Thank you.
SHEILA	f	Hey, Terry.
TERRY	m	Hey.
SHEILA	f	Where'd you get the hat?
TERRY	m	Oh, I got it on the street for a  dollar.
SHEILA	f	It's nice.
TERRY	m	Well, you know, it's pretty much  your standard woolen hat.
SHEILA	f	Yeah, I had a very similar reaction  to it.
TERRY	m	Can I get that money from you?
SHEILA	f	Yeah. Sorry.
TERRY	m	Is that all you have?
SHEILA	f	Yeah.
TERRY	m	Can you borrow some cash from your  brother?
SHEILA	f	Um, yeah, but that would involve  speaking to him.
TERRY	m	Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone  for a couple of days at least, Sheila.
SHEILA	f	Why do you have to stay so long?
TERRY	m	Because my sister is not a bank, you  know? I can't just show up and ask  her for --
SHEILA	f	You seem to think my brother's a  bank!
TERRY	m	Oh Sheila can we just cut out the  puerile crap?! I'll be back just as  soon as I can. OK? I am not the kind  of man that everyone says I am.
SHEILA	f	I know you're not.
TERRY	m	I'll call you tonight.
SHEILA	f	Don't you wanna tell me you love me?
TERRY	m	I love you.
SHEILA	f	That was really convincing.
TERRY	m	Well... I think after this is over  you should seriously consider moving  back home.
SHEILA	f	Oh, yeah.
TERRY	m	All right...
SHEILA	f	You gonna call tonight?
TERRY	m	Definitely.
SAMMY	m	Hello?... TERRY!...
SHERIFF	m	Whoa there!
TERRY	m	Sorry.
SHERIFF	m	God damn! Terry Prescott! How you  doin'? Gimme a cuddle!
TERRY	m	How you doin', Darryl?
SHERIFF	m	Which way you headed?
TERRY	m	I'm just goin' to see Sammy at  Dawson's...
SHERIFF	m	Can I walk with you a little?
TERRY	m	Sure, yeah --
SHERIFF	m	So Sammy says you been out in  Alaska...?
TERRY	m	Yeah, I was workin' out there for a  little while...
SHERIFF	m	-- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards  from all across the country.
TERRY	m	Yeah, I've been all over the place...
SHERIFF	m	Well, it's good to have you back  here, I'll tell you that.
TERRY	m	Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the  peace.
SHERIFF	m	Well, that'll be a little harder now  that you're home, but I'll do what I  can.
TERRY	m	No, man, I'm reformed.
SHERIFF	m	Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.
TERRY	m	Thanks, Darryl.
TERRY	m	Sorry about yesterday --
SAMMY	m	I don't care --
TERRY	m	I was studying the bus description...  and I just... I got on the wrong bus --  I mean I missed my stop --
SAMMY	m	I don't care, Terry. I'm just so  glad to see you...!
TERRY	m	I'm glad to see you too, Sammy. Um...  are you coming from work?
SAMMY	m	Um, no, it's Saturday...
TERRY	m	Yeah, no, it's just... you're dressed  so formally...
SAMMY	m	Oh. No. You know, I just thought I'd --  You know I thought it was a special  occasion... which it is...
TERRY	m	No, it's good. I thought I'd dress  up too.
SAMMY	m	That's OK. You look fine.
TERRY	m	Yeah, this is the haute cuisine of  garments.
SAMMY	m	What?
TERRY	m	Nothing, nothing... Um... So how are  you?
SAMMY	m	I'm fine.
TERRY	m	How's Rudy?
SAMMY	m	We're fine, Terry. How are you? I mean --
TERRY	m	Yeah...
SAMMY	m	-- Where have you been lately, Terry?
TERRY	m	-- I know, I haven't been --
SAMMY	m	I got a postcard from you from  Alaska...?
TERRY	m	Yeah, I was up there for a while...
SAMMY	m	But that was in the Fall, Terry...
TERRY	m	Yeah, I know I've been out of touch...
SAMMY	m	I was a little worried. I mean --
TERRY	m	Oh, I been a lotta different places...  Um... I went down to Florida for a  while... I was doing some work in  Orlando... I've been all over the  place.
SAMMY	m	Well... I just wish you would have  let me know you were OK...
TERRY	m	Yeah. I didn't realize it'd been so  long...
SAMMY	m	Are you gonna stay in town for a  while?
TERRY	m	Well, I don't know... I got all these  things I gotta do back in Worcester...
SAMMY	m	Oh...
TERRY	m	...Yeah, so I'm probably not gonna  be able to stay more than a day or  so...
SAMMY	m	Oh... Well... That's all right...!
TERRY	m	...I'm kind of trying to keep to a  schedule of sorts. It's a long and  worthy story but I won't trouble you  with it right now.
SAMMY	m	Are you expecting someone?
TERRY	m	Who would I be expecting here?
SAMMY	m	You just keep looking around, that's  all.
TERRY	m	No, I was just wondering if we could  get some more refreshments, actually.
TERRY	m	I've actually got to confess to you,  Sammy... that the reason you may not  have heard from me for a little while  is that I've been kind of unable to  write... on account of the fact that  I was in jail for a little while.
SAMMY	m	You were what?
TERRY	m	Well, I did a little time, I guess,  in Florida. For, uh, just for  bullshit...
SAMMY	m	What?!
TERRY	m	It was just bullshit...
SAMMY	m	What did you do?
TERRY	m	I didn't do anything. Does it occur  to you that maybe I was wronged?
SAMMY	m	No!
TERRY	m	Well, could I please --
SAMMY	m	Oh my God! --
TERRY	m	Would you please let me --
SAMMY	m	-- What happened?!
TERRY	m	I got into a fight in a bar down in  Florida. Which I was not the one who  instigated it, at all. But they worked  up all this bullshit against me and  they threw me in the pen for three  months. I didn't write you because I  didn't want you to get all upset  about it. I just figured you'd figure  I was on the road for a little while.  I know it was stupid and I'm sorry.  I really didn't mean to make you  worry. But you know what? I can't  run around all the time doin' stuff  or not doin' stuff because it's gonna  make you worry! Because then I come  back here, and I tell you about my  fuckin'... traumas, and I get this  wounded little "I've Let You Down"  bullshit, over and over again, and  it really just -- cramps me! Like I  just want to get out from under it!...  And here I am back in this fuckin'  hole explaining myself to you again!
SAMMY	m	OK -- Can you please stop cursing at  me?
TERRY	m	I mean, I realize I'm in no position  to, uh, basically say anything, ever --  But it's not like I'm down there in  some redneck bar in Florida having  an argument with some stripper's  boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey!  Maybe this'd be a good time to really  stick it to Sammy and get myself  locked up for a few months."
SAMMY	m	I'm sorry.
TERRY	m	Me too, man. I mean "welcome home."
SAMMY	m	Hey -- You don't write me for six  months, I have no idea where you are --
TERRY	m	I'm sorry --
SAMMY	m	-- I don't know if you're alive or  dead --
TERRY	m	I'm sorry --
SAMMY	m	-- and then you show up out of nowhere  and tell me you were in jail?
TERRY	m	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,  Sammy, I'm really sorry...!
TERRY	m	Sammy...
SAMMY	m	What?
TERRY	m	Um... I'm in the midst of a slight  predicament...
SAMMY	m	What do you need? Money?
TERRY	m	Um... Yeah... I'm broke. I gotta get  back to Worcester tomorrow. I got  this girl there, and she's kind of  in a bad situation...? I just need  to borrow some money. Whatever you  can spare. I'll pay you back... I'll pay you  back, man.
SAMMY	m	I really wish Mom was here.
TERRY	m	So do I, man.
SAMMY	m	Nobody knows what to do with you.
TERRY	m	I know how they feel, man.
SAMMY	m	Terry? Can I ask you something?
TERRY	m	Sure.
SAMMY	m	Well -- I mean, do you ever go to  church anymore?
TERRY	m	Come on, Sammy, can we not talk about  that shit?
SAMMY	m	Do you?
TERRY	m	Um -- No, Sammy. I don't.
SAMMY	m	Can you tell me why not?
TERRY	m	Um, yeah. Because I think it's  ridiculous.
SAMMY	m	Well -- can you tell me without like,  denigrating what I believe in?
TERRY	m	Because I think it's primitive, OK?  I think it's a fairy tale.
SAMMY	m	Well -- I mean, have you ever  considered that maybe that's part of  what's making things so difficult  for you?
TERRY	m	No.
SAMMY	m	-- That you've lost hold of -- well,  not just your religious feeling, but  lost hold of any kind of anchor, any  kind of trust in anything... I mean  no wonder you drift around so much.  What could ever stop you? How would  you ever know if you had found the  right thing?
TERRY	m	Well, uh, I'm not really looking for  anything, man. I'm just, like, trying  to get on with it.
WAITRESS	?	Here we go...
TERRY	m	Thank you, Sammy... I'm really gonna  pay this back.
TERRY	m	Where we going?
SAMMY	m	To pick up Rudy.
TERRY	m	Well... do you not even want me to  visit now? 'Cause I can catch the  bus at five o'clock if that's what  you want.
SAMMY	m	Well, of course I want you to visit,  you idiot! I've been looking forward  to seeing you more than anything!  I've been telling everyone I know  that you were coming home! I cleaned  the whole fucking house so it would  look nice for you! I thought you  were gonna stay for at least a few  days! It didn't occur to me that you  were just broke again. I wish you  would have just sent me an invoice!
TERRY	m	Hi, is that Malcolm?... Hi, this is  Terry Prescott?... I been trying to  get ahold of Sheila and there's no  answer, and I was just wondering if  she -- She what?...
TERRY	m	When?... Well -- Is she all right?...  Well, could I talk to her?... Well,  could you give her a message that I --
TERRY	m	That girl I'm with tried to kill  herself.
SAMMY	m	What?
TERRY	m	She tried to kill herself.
SAMMY	m	Do you have everything you need?
TERRY	m	I think so.
SAMMY	m	What are you going to do?
TERRY	m	I don't know. Send the money I guess.
SAMMY	m	Maybe you should stay home for a  little while, Terry.
TERRY	m	Yeah, maybe that'd be a good idea.
SAMMY	m	I'm going to bed. Do you have  everything you need?
TERRY	m	Yeah. Thanks.
SAMMY	m	Good night.
TERRY	m	Good night.
SAMMY	m	Terry, I'm really glad you're home.
TERRY	m	Yeah, me too, Sammy.
SAMMY	m	OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the  bus, then all you have to do is drop  me off at the bank, and just pick  Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town  hall, and drive him over to Carol's  house. And that's it. She's on Harvey  Lane, right past where the Dewitts  used to live.
TERRY	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	Rudy knows where she lives.
TERRY	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	God, Mabel, don't those colors hurt  your eyes?
MABEL	f	Oh no, they keep me fresh.
BRIAN	m	Yeah! Hi, Sammy. What can I do for you?
SAMMY	m	Um, Brian? Did you want us to turn  this time sheet in at the end of the  day, or do you want it at the end of  the week...?
BRIAN	m	Oh, yeah, end of the day'll be fine.
SAMMY	m	Seems like an awful lot of extra  paperwork...
BRIAN	m	I like paperwork.
RUDY	m	You showed up.
TERRY	m	Looks that way.
TERRY	m	Put on your seat belt.
RUDY	m	It pushes on my neck.
TERRY	m	What?
RUDY	m	It pushes on my neck. It's  uncomfortable.
TERRY	m	Well, when somebody slams into us  and you go sailin' through the  windshield, that's liable to be  uncomfortable too. So put on your  seat belt.
RUDY	m	Mom's parents died in a car accident.
TERRY	m	I know. They're my parents too.
RUDY	m	They are?
TERRY	m	Well, yeah. Your mom is my sister.
RUDY	m	Yeah, I know.
TERRY	m	So that means we have the same  parents.
RUDY	m	Oh yeah.
MABEL	f	Um -- Carol just called. She said  Terry and Rudy never showed up at  her house?
SAMMY	m	You've got to be kidding me.
BRIAN	m	Hey, Sammy?
TERRY	m	Hey. Look.
TERRY	m	You hold it further down, you're  gonna get a lot more power. You should  be able to put that nail down with  two or three hits. Look:
TERRY	m	Try it.
RUDY	m	That's not the way I hold it.
TERRY	m	Well, the way you hold it is wrong.
RUDY	m	Why can't I just do it my own way?
TERRY	m	You can.
SAMMY	m	Brian? Did you want to see me?
BRIAN	m	Yeah. I was kind of wondering what  happened to you today.
SAMMY	m	Oh -- Didn't Mabel -- I had a false  alarm about my son...
BRIAN	m	Yeah, I kind of thought you were  gonna work that out.
SAMMY	m	Well, I did work it out -- more or  less --
BRIAN	m	Then why're you running outta here  in the middle of the day without a  word of explanation to me, Sammy?
SAMMY	m	Brian, don't yell at me.
BRIAN	m	I'm -- I'm not yelling. I'm just  gettin' a little frustrated here.
SAMMY	m	Well Brian:
BRIAN	m	Sorry, could you close the door  please?
SAMMY	m	...And Eddy Dwyer lives in Buffalo,  with his wife and two sons, if you  can believe it.
TERRY	m	That is depressing.
SAMMY	m	Why?
TERRY	m	He just never struck me as the  marrying type, that's all.
RUDY	m	Who are you talking about?
TERRY	m	Wild kids we used to know.
RUDY	m	Were you a wild kid?
TERRY	m	Not compared to your Mom.
RUDY	m	Yeah, right.
TERRY	m	You don't believe me?
RUDY	m	No.
TERRY	m	Ask her.
RUDY	m	Mom, were you?
SAMMY	m	No comment.
RUDY	m	What are you doing?
TERRY	m	Oh -- Just readin' some of your  compositions.
RUDY	m	Why are you smoking?
TERRY	m	Um... Because it's bad. Don't ever  do it.
RUDY	m	I won't.
TERRY	m	You know this used to be my room?
RUDY	m	Yeah... Do you want it back?
TERRY	m	No.
RUDY	m	Did you fight in Vietnam?
TERRY	m	No. I wasn't even born yet.
RUDY	m	Were you ever in the army?
TERRY	m	No.
RUDY	m	My father was in the army.
TERRY	m	I know. Unfortunately he didn't fight  in Vietnam either.
RUDY	m	Were you friends with him?
TERRY	m	Not really. We had some friends in  common, I guess... I didn't like him  very much.
RUDY	m	Why not?
TERRY	m	Well, he wasn't very likable.
RUDY	m	Why do you say that?
TERRY	m	I don't know. He was always -- He  always had to be better than you at  everything. You know. Like if you  were all playing basketball or  something, everybody's havin' like a  friendly game and he's like ready to  kill somebody if his team didn't  win. Or like if you told like a joke  or a story, he always had to tell a  better one? Kinda gets annoying after  a while. Plus it was pretty scummy  how he split on your mom and you...  He was a prick. Probably still a  prick. Fortunately for you though,  your mom is like, the greatest. So  you had some bad luck and you had  some good luck. You mind if I ask you a personal  question?
RUDY	m	I don't know.
TERRY	m	Do you like it here? I mean, in  Scottsville?
RUDY	m	Yeah...?
TERRY	m	Why?
RUDY	m	I don't know. My friends are here...  I like the scenery... I don't know.
TERRY	m	I know, I know, but it's so... There's  nothing to do here.
RUDY	m	Yes there is.
TERRY	m	No there isn't, man! It's narrow.  It's dull. It's a dull, narrow town  full of dull, narrow people who don't  know anything except... what things  are like right around here. They  have no perspective whatsoever. No  scope. They might as well be living  in the nineteenth century because  they have no idea what's going on,  and if you try to tell 'em that,  they wanna fuckin' kill you.
RUDY	m	What are you talking about?
TERRY	m	I don't know...
TERRY	m	You're a good kid.
BRIAN	m	Yeah. This doesn't apply to you  directly, Sammy, but I've noticed  that some of the employees have their  PC monitors set with all kinds of  crazy colors... Purple and polka  dots or what have you. And it's not  a big deal, but really, this is a  bank. You know? It's not really  appropriate. So I'm just asking that  people stick to a more quote unquote  normal range of colors in future...
BRIAN	m	Like I say, it doesn't really apply  to you.
SAMMY	m	No, my computer palette's pretty  conservative.
BOB	m	Bob Steegerson.
SAMMY	m	What are you wearing?
BOB	m	Mom?
SAMMY	m	What's up?
TERRY	m	Do you know you have an enormous  leak from the upstairs hall?
SAMMY	m	Um, yeah, thanks, I did.
SAMMY	m	Are you guys sure you're gonna be
TERRY	m	Yes. Yes.
SAMMY	m	What is happening here?
TERRY	m	It's just -- The problem is that the  pipe is corroded all the way along  the length of the hall. So every  time I put in a new piece it starts  leaking further down.
SAMMY	m	Why don't I just call the plumber?
TERRY	m	Why? He's not gonna do anything  different than what I'm doing.
RUDY	m	Yeah. We're making it worse!
TERRY	m	No we're not. Shut up.
SAMMY	m	Thank you. Thank you both.
SAMMY	m	Now, call if there's any problem,  and if I'm not there, I'm either on  my way or on my way back home.
TERRY	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	So lights out at ten... and don't  spend the whole night watching TV.
TERRY	m	Nice to meet you, Bob.
BOB	m	You too.
TERRY	m	What's your idea of the whole night?
SAMMY	m	Two hours tops.
TERRY	m	What's your feeling about Bob?
RUDY	m	I don't really know him that well.
TERRY	m	I have bad news for you.
RUDY	m	No...!
RUDY	m	Great. What are we supposed to do  now?
TERRY	m	Do you know how to play pool?
RUDY	m	I've played it.
RUDY	m	I don't think they let kids in there.
TERRY	m	Well, we're not allowed to watch any  more TV, so it's this or nothing...  But if we run into any trouble, let  me do the talking.
RUDY	m	OK.
TERRY	m	I got a hundred bucks here says me  and my nephew can beat anybody in  here. Only we gotta get the next  game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by  ten o'clock.
TERRY	m	Just hit it nice and soft... Nice  and soft.
RUDY	m	Sorry.
TERRY	m	God damn, Rudy. I thought you said  you could play.
TERRY	m	Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.
SAMMY	m	Bob... Are you serious?
BOB	m	Yeah.
SAMMY	m	I... I don't know what to say. I --
BOB	m	I mean, I know I haven't exactly  been the most... decisive... guy. In  the past... I don't know: I'm tired  of foolin' around. And I love you.
SAMMY	m	I... I'm totally... I don't know  what to say.
BOB	m	Well, you could always say "Yes." Or you could think about it first.
SAMMY	m	That's it: I want to think about it.
BOB	m	OK... Fair enough.
TERRY	m	Ohhhh!
TERRY	m	It's all yours, baby.
TERRY	m	Just make sure to hit it really  gentle. But firm. And hit it a little  low so you get some backspin. Don't  even hit it. Just kiss it.
RUDY	m	What do you mean, kiss it?
TERRY	m	I mean tap it. Firm but very, very  softly. And don't shoot until you  know it's going in. OK?
RUDY	m	OK.
TERRY	m	That was great!
RUDY	m	We creamed those guys! We creamed  them!
TERRY	m	Ssh...! Don't move.
TERRY	m	It's them!
TERRY	m	Go! Go! Go!
TERRY	m	Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!
TERRY	m	What are you doing?
RUDY	m	I can't get my sleeve out...!
SAMMY	m	What is going on in here?
TERRY	m	Um -- We were just out doing some  star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track  of the time. Which I totally warned  him about. You are a bad kid.
TERRY	m	Hey: I think it's OK. Just don't  tell her where we went, 'cause she'll  be really mad at me. OK?
RUDY	m	I won't.
TERRY	m	Hey -- I'm not kidding, Rudy.
RUDY	m	I won't!
SAMMY	m	Did you know my Mommy used to take  me and Uncle Terry out at night to  look at the constellations?
RUDY	m	Yeah.
SAMMY	m	Did you see that one, what's the one --  It looks like a big "W"? Cassiopeia?
RUDY	m	Yeah.
SAMMY	m	Ow! Shit!
SAMMY	m	I've got a great idea. Why don't you  let me call the plumber?
TERRY	m	Do whatever you want.
SAMMY	m	Oh, does that make you mad?
TERRY	m	No...
SAMMY	m	Brian, get off my ass!
BRIAN	m	Excuse me?
SAMMY	m	I didn't change the colors on your  stupid computer screen.
BRIAN	m	Well, that's all you gotta say!
SAMMY	m	There is nothing wrong with the work  I do here. I have been doing just  fine, the whole time before you came  here -- And if you think that riding  people in this petty, ridiculous way  is the way to improve service in  this bank or anywhere else I think  you're out of your mind!
BRIAN	m	I didn't say there was. Could I please --  Could I please -- May I respond?
SAMMY	m	No, that's really all I have to --
BRIAN	m	May I respond? First of all, I don't appreciate  being spoken to with that kind of  language. That's not the way I talk  to you, and I'd appreciate it if you  wouldn't talk that way to me --
SAMMY	m	Well --
BRIAN	m	Second of all, if you say you didn't  change the colors on my computer  screen, then of course I accept your  answer. But you and I are gonna have  to find a way to work together --
SAMMY	m	Brian --
BRIAN	m	But that's not gonna happen with the  attitude, it's not gonna happen with  the lateness, it's not gonna happen  by fighting me every step of the way --  OK, well not you, you're not late,  but too much of that stuff goes on  around here --
SAMMY	m	I am not late and I do not have an  attitude -- Well then don't tell me  I'm late if I'm not late!
BRIAN	m	I'd really like to finish!
SAMMY	m	They were where?
PLUMBER	m	OK, you're all set.
BRIAN	m	This is Chuck. Chuck, this is my  wife, Nancy.
CHUCK	m	Hello.
NANCY	f	Nice to meet you.
BRIAN	m	This is Mabel...
MABEL	f	Hi.
NANCY	f	Nice to meet you.
BRIAN	m	This is Sammy, our lending officer.  Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.
SAMMY	m	Hi. It's nice to meet you.
NANCY	f	Brian -- I gotta sit down.
BRIAN	m	Sure -- Let's go in my office.
NANCY	f	I'm fine...!
SAMMY	m	Brian...?
BRIAN	m	Yeah.
RUDY	m	Mom!
SAMMY	m	Rudy!
SAMMY	m	Look, I'm glad you guys are getting  along so well -- like, you have no  idea -- but if I can't rely on you  to remember to get him once a day...
TERRY	m	You can!
SAMMY	m	-- And what are you doing taking him  to play pool in the middle of the  night, and then telling him to lie  to me about it?
TERRY	m	I don't know.
TERRY	m	Get out of the car.
RUDY	m	What are we doing?
TERRY	m	You're going to Carol's house and  I'm going home.
RUDY	m	Why can't I come with you?
TERRY	m	Because if you're such a baby you  gotta tell your Mommy about us playin'  pool when I totally asked you not  to, and I gotta listen to her shit  all day, then you're goin' to the  baby-sitter's so you can stay at the  baby house.
RUDY	m	But I didn't tell her!
TERRY	m	You know what? Don't even fuckin'  talk to me.
RUDY	m	I didn't!
TERRY	m	Just get out of the car.
BRIAN	m	You're working late.
SAMMY	m	How did your wife like the bank?
BRIAN	m	Oh, fine. She wasn't feeling so great.
SAMMY	m	That's too bad.
BRIAN	m	No -- I don't mean -- She's not ill.  She's just... I don't know...
SAMMY	m	Pregnant?
BRIAN	m	That's it. She's pregnant.
SAMMY	m	It can make you kind of cranky.
BRIAN	m	Yeah...
BRIAN	m	Listen, I'm sorry we've been stepping  on each other's toes -- I -- I'm not  actually that bad a guy --
SAMMY	m	Yeah, I am too... I know you're not,  Brian, but you're driving everybody  crazy.
BRIAN	m	Well, I -- I'm just trying to do my  best here -- And I'm gettin' it from  all sides.
SAMMY	m	I know you are...
BRIAN	m	Anyway... We'll work it out...
SAMMY	m	Well... I could use a beer.
BRIAN	m	I could use a tranquilizer.
SAMMY	m	Last I heard, Rudy's Dad was living  over in Auburn. But that was last  year.
BRIAN	m	Must be so tough raising a kid on  your own... Although I'm beginning  to get the idea my wife wouldn't  mind a crack at it.
SAMMY	m	Oh... It's just the hormones.
BRIAN	m	Well, no, it isn't. But never mind.
BRIAN	m	Well, here's to improved employee- management relations.
SAMMY	m	Amen.
SAMMY	m	You can't judge all of Scottsville  by the people in that bank, believe  me.
BRIAN	m	Well -- Let's -- Let's not talk about  the bank.
SAMMY	m	OK.
BRIAN	m	Let's just forget about the bank for  tonight.
SAMMY	m	Good idea.
BRIAN	m	Sammy?
SAMMY	m	Yeah?
BRIAN	m	I want you to tell me who changed  the colors on my computer screen.
SAMMY	m	I'll never tell.
TERRY	m	Where were you?
SAMMY	m	Nowhere. I had dinner with my boss.
TERRY	m	Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?
SAMMY	m	Yeah. How was Rudy?
TERRY	m	Fine.
SAMMY	m	Did the plumber come?
TERRY	m	Yes, the fucking plumber came.
SAMMY	m	Terry -- Give me a break!!!
TERRY	m	What's the matter with you?
SAMMY	m	Nothing. I'm just tired.
TERRY	m	You want to smoke some pot?
SAMMY	m	No I don't. Why, you got some?
SAMMY	m	So... Bob asked me to marry him.
TERRY	m	Wow. Are you going to?
SAMMY	m	I don't know. If he'd've asked me  this time last year I would have  probably said yes. But the minute he  said it, I don't know, I felt like  somebody was trying to strangle me.
TERRY	m	Well... bad sign.
SAMMY	m	I know. Plus, Terry... I fucked my boss...!
TERRY	m	What?
SAMMY	m	I know! And his wife is six months  pregnant.
TERRY	m	Jesus Christ, Sammy...!
SAMMY	m	I know, I know.
SAMMY	m	Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before.  I just don't want him, you know --  terrified of "telling," if there's --
TERRY	m	Uh, well, that's not really his  problem, Sammy.
SAMMY	m	Oh really? What's his problem?
TERRY	m	His problem is that he's like totally  sheltered because you treat him like  he's three, instead of eight, so  that's how he behaves.
SAMMY	m	Oh yeah? And how do you think he  should behave?
TERRY	m	I think he shouldn't have to run and  tell his Mommy every time he does  something she might not like, for  one thing.
SAMMY	m	Uh huh. And what do you --
TERRY	m	I mean I took him to play pool! It  was a little clandestine thing we  did for fun! It wasn't like a big  secret, I mean who cares? I was  actually trying to be nice to him.  But he's so freaked out that he  disobeyed your orders that he has to  fuckin' squeal on me and I have to  listen to your fuckin' shit all day  when I didn't even fuckin' do  anything!
SAMMY	m	First of all, he didn't tell me  anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of  all, I don't really give a shit if  you took him to play pool: I was mad  at you because you left him standing  at the bus stop in the rain. But no,  I don't want you telling him not to  squeal, because I don't want him put  in that position!
TERRY	m	Well... that... is a perfect example  of what I'm talking about.
SAMMY	m	You are in idiot.
TERRY	m	Darryl told you?
SAMMY	m	Yes!
SAMMY	m	Morning.
BRIAN	m	Yeah, good morning. Could you get  the door?
SAMMY	m	Listen -- I just --
SAMMY	m	Brian, that's enough.
BRIAN	m	OK. Sorry.
BOB	m	You're awfully quiet.
SAMMY	m	I'm sorry.
BOB	m	Um... Have you thought at all about  what I said?
SAMMY	m	Of course I've been thinking about  it.
BOB	m	So... Any decisions? Or -- do you  still want to think about it some  more...?
SAMMY	m	Well -- I mean -- I don't know, Bob.  I mean, we haven't exactly been going  steady the last few months, if you  know what I mean --
BOB	m	Yeah, no, I know --
SAMMY	m	-- and then we see each other twice  and you suddenly say you want to get  married? I mean...
BOB	m	No, you're right, you're right --
SAMMY	m	What are you talking about?
BOB	m	I don't know... I... Maybe this is...  Last year I sort of thought you were  possibly interested in that... idea...  but I was the one who, you know,  wasn't "ready" at that point -- So  that's why I thought things kind of  slowed down with us...
SAMMY	m	Don't make me feel bad for you.
BOB	m	I don't want you to feel bad for me.
SAMMY	m	Hello?
BRIAN	m	It's Brian.
SAMMY	m	Brian. Where are you?
BRIAN	m	I'm buying milk. I just thought I'd  say hello.
BRIAN	m	Look, I know it's probably too late,  but is there any way you can come  out for a little while?
SAMMY	m	Brian, I think you're going crazy.
BRIAN	m	I know I am. Can you meet me?
SAMMY	m	Um, OK.
SAMMY	m	Um -- I have to go out for a minute.  Do you want anything?
TERRY	m	Like what?
SAMMY	m	I don't know.
RUDY	m	Where are you going?
TERRY	m	Yeah, where are you going?
SAMMY	m	I just have to go out for a little  while.
RUDY	m	Where?
TERRY	m	Yeah, where?
SAMMY	m	I just have to go to Mabel's house.
RUDY	m	Why?
SAMMY	m	You know what, Rudy? It's personal.  This is a personal matter that has  to do with Mabel. I just have to go  see her for a little while.
TERRY	m	Listen. Listen. I'm sorry I said you  squealed on me. I was totally out of  line, and I really owe you an apology. Did you hear what I said?
RUDY	m	I don't care.
RON	m	What's on your mind, Sammy?
SAMMY	m	Well, a lot. But principally... I  was just wondering if you had an  opinion. If you know someone, in  your family, or just someone you  really care about, and they just  can't seem to get ahold of  themselves...
TERRY	m	You know who this is for?
RUDY	m	Me!
TERRY	m	That's right, my little friend. Hello. We're going fishing.
RUDY	m	I got a new rod and reel, five lures,  I got a hat, I got a knife and I got  a fish scaler.
SAMMY	m	That's great, honey.
TERRY	m	I'll get it.
TERRY	m	Well... I'm not really sure why you're  here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't  exactly been a model citizen since I  got here, but compared to how things  have been goin' for me lately, I  thought I was doing pretty well.
TERRY	m	And I also find it kind of  discouraging that you seem to think  I need some kind of spiritual  counseling or what have you, so much  so that you're willing to disregard  the fact that I don't believe in any  of this stuff at all --
SAMMY	m	Well... I didn't mean to discourage  you --
TERRY	m	I mean it's really kind of insulting.
RON	m	Can I say something here? Sammy asked me to come and talk to  you, because it's her opinion that  you're not gonna find what you're  looking for the way you're looking  for it --
TERRY	m	How would she know?
RON	m	But I'm really not here to try to  get you to do anything, or to believe  anything. And I'll tell you the same  thing I told her, which is that as  far as I'm concerned the only way  she can help you is by her example --  by trying to be a model for you, by  the way she lives her life...
RON	m	And that doesn't mean she's supposed  to be a saint, either, if that's  what you're smiling about.
TERRY	m	I didn't realize I was smiling.
RON	m	You know, Terry, a lot of people  come to see me with all kinds of  problems. Drugs, alcohol, marital  problems, sexual problems, health  problems --
TERRY	m	Great job you got.
RON	m	Well... I like it. Because even in  this little town, I feel like what I  do is very connected with the real  center of people's lives. I'm not  saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but  I don't feel like my life is off to  the side of what's important. You  know? I don't feel my happiness and  comfort are based on closing my eyes  to trouble within myself or trouble  in other people. I don't feel like a  negligible little scrap, floating  around in some kind of empty void,  with no sense of connectedness to  anything around me except by virtue  of whatever little philosophies I  can scrape together on my own...
TERRY	m	Well --
RON	m	Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think  your life is important?
TERRY	m	You mean -- Like, me personally, my  individual life?
RON	m	Yeah.
TERRY	m	Well... I'm not sure -- What do you  mean? It's important to me. I guess.  And like, to my, you know, the people  who care about me...
RON	m	But do you think it's important?
TERRY	m	I --
RON	m	Do you think it's important in the  scheme of things? Not just because  it's yours, or because you're  somebody's brother. Because I don't  really get the impression that you  do.
TERRY	m	Well, I don't think... I don't  particularly think anybody's life  has any particular importance besides  whatever -- you know -- whatever we  arbitrarily give it. Which is fine.  I mean we might as well... I think  I'm as important as anybody else...
TERRY	m	I don't know: A lot of what you're  saying has a real appeal to me, Ron.  A lot of the stuff they told us when  we were kids... But I don't want to  believe something or not believe it  because I might feel bad. I want to  believe it because I think it's true  or not... I'd like to think that my  life is important... Or that it's  connected to something important...
RON	m	Well, isn't there any way for you to  believe that without calling it God,  or religion, or whatever term it is  you object to?
TERRY	m	Yes. I believe that.
TERRY	m	So Sammy, what example will you be  setting for us tonight?
RUDY	m	What time are we getting up to go  fishing?
TERRY	m	We're not going fishing.
SAMMY	m	What do you mean?
RUDY	m	Why not?
TERRY	m	I think you should go fishing with  Father Ron.
RUDY	m	I don't want to go fishing with Father  Ron.
TERRY	m	Well, I'm not takin' you.
SAMMY	m	I'll take you, sweetie.
SAMMY	m	I realize that you're mad at me --
TERRY	m	I'm not mad at you...
SAMMY	m	-- but he didn't do anything to you.  And you cannot promise a little boy  that you're gonna --
TERRY	m	...I just, you know, after all that  religious conversation, I just  realized it's probably not so good  for him to be spending so much time  with someone like me who doesn't  believe his life is important in the  scheme of things --
SAMMY	m	Would you please...
TERRY	m	I'm serious.
SAMMY	m	Listen. I am sure, if you put your mind to  it, you can think of some other way  of getting back at me besides this.  So would you please just give it  some thought, and take him fishing  tomorrow?
TERRY	m	I would, Sammy, I just don't think  it'd be good for him.
SAMMY	m	You suck.
NANCY	f	Hello?
BOB	m	Hello?
SAMMY	m	Anyway... I don't know what the  church's position is on adultery and  fornication these days, but I felt  really hypocritical not saying  anything to you about it before,  so... What is the official position  on that stuff these days?
RON	m	Well... it's a sin.
SAMMY	m	Good: I think it should be.
RON	m	...but we don't tend to focus on  that aspect of it, right off the bat --
SAMMY	m	Why not?
RON	m	Well --
SAMMY	m	I think you should.
RON	m	Well --
SAMMY	m	Maybe it was better when you came in  and they screamed at you for having  sex with your married boss, and were  really mean to you, and told you  what a terrible thing it was. Maybe  it'd be better if you told me how  I'm endangering my immortal soul,  and if I don't quit I'm going to  burn in hell. Don't you ever think  that?
RON	m	Um... No.
SAMMY	m	Well, it's a lot better than all  this "Why do you think you're in  this situation" psychological bullshit  you hear all the time.
RON	m	Well... Why do you think you're in  this situation?
SAMMY	m	With which one?
RON	m	All of them.
SAMMY	m	I feel sorry for them. Isn't that ridiculous?
RUDY	m	I've never been so bored in my life.
TERRY	m	Yeah... We really shoulda been out  here around seven or eight A.M.
RUDY	m	What time is it now?
TERRY	m	Two-thirty.
RUDY	m	Was my father a good fisherman?
TERRY	m	Yeah, your father was good at all  that stuff. He knew everything about  the woods, everything about fishing,  everything about hunting and  everything about cars. If he wasn't  such a pain in the ass he would've  been a lot of fun to be around.
RUDY	m	Maybe he's nicer now.
TERRY	m	I doubt it.
RUDY	m	Well, I think he is.
TERRY	m	How would you know? Did you ever  meet him?
RUDY	m	No.
TERRY	m	Were you ever curious to meet him?
RUDY	m	I guess so.
TERRY	m	Well, he doesn't live very far from  here.
RUDY	m	I thought he lived in Alaska.
TERRY	m	No -- I lived in Alaska. Your dad  lives in Auburn. Far as I know. We could look him up in the phone  book. Wanna try?
RUDY	m	All right.
TERRY	m	OK -- But -- I'm sure I don't have  to say this, but I'm not kidding,  man: Don't -- tell -- your -- mother.
BOB	m	Do you want to go for a walk, or a  drive? It's really nice out.
SAMMY	m	No. I'm not gonna stay long. Bob, I  don't want to get married.
BOB	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	I've really thought about it a lot,  and if you had asked me last year  I'm sure I would have said yes.
BOB	m	Oh. Thank you.
SAMMY	m	But I'm not sure it would have been  a good idea then either. I'm going  through a really hard time right now  and I just think that getting engaged  to you or anyone would be just about  the stupidest most self-destructive  thing I could possibly do.
BOB	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	And I really think you have to grow  up.
BOB	m	Well, how about we fix up my  personality some other time?
SAMMY	m	OK.
BOB	m	Oh, yes, me too.
SAMMY	m	Bob... This is so crazy... I mean...  I don't even understand why you... I  don't even get it.
BOB	m	What do you want me to say? Everything  you said about me was true, Sammy. I  was just a big chickenshit jerk, and  now I'm payin' the price.
SAMMY	m	Bob...!
BOB	m	What?
SAMMY	m	Well -- I don't know...
BOB	m	I don't know. Sammy, I love you. I  wish I could say it in a more  interesting way. I just -- I love  you.
SAMMY	m	Well -- I mean -- I love you too --
SAMMY	m	Oh shit.
BOB	m	What's the matter?
SAMMY	m	I gotta go. I'm sorry --
BOB	m	Where do you have to go?
SAMMY	m	I'm supposed to -- I gotta get Mabel  back her car.
BOB	m	Well... I don't understand. How are  we leaving things?
SAMMY	m	Oh God, I don't know. Call me later.
SAMMY	m	Sorry I'm so late.
BRIAN	m	Yeah, I was just about to give up on  you.
SAMMY	m	Well -- maybe it would've been better  if you had...
SAMMY	m	I mean -- Look, I don't mean to be  unsympathetic about your domestic  situation, whatever it is, but I'm  just beginning to think that if people  tried a little harder to stick to  their commitments and started taking  a little responsibility for their  actions, they might end up having a  lot less trouble generally. That's  all.
BRIAN	m	Hey, that's what I've been trying to  tell you guys at the bank.
SAMMY	m	Well, I really don't think I can do  this anymore.
BRIAN	m	OK.
SAMMY	m	This is incredible.
BRIAN	m	Mmmm.
SAMMY	m	That is not what I mean.
RUDY	m	Maybe we should call first.
TERRY	m	Well -- We're right here.
TERRY	m	Come on.
TERRY	m	There he is.
RUDY	m	His last name is Kolinski?
TERRY	m	Yeah. Ring the bell.
JANIE	f	Yes?
TERRY	m	Hi. We're looking for Rudy?
JANIE	f	Who should I say is calling?
TERRY	m	An old friend.
RUDY SR.	m	Who is it?
JANIE	f	He says an old friend!
RUDY SR.	m	How old is he?
RUDY SR.	m	Hey!
TERRY	m	Hey, Rudy.
RUDY SR.	m	Hey.
TERRY	m	Hi, I'm Terry.
JANIE	f	Hello.
TERRY	m	And this is Rudy.
JANIE	f	You don't say.
TERRY	m	Rudy, meet Rudy.
JANIE	f	I'll just be in the kitchen.
TERRY	m	Nice to meet you.
TERRY	m	OK if we come in for a minute?
RUDY SR.	m	What the hell are you doin'?
TERRY	m	What do you mean what am I doin' --
RUDY SR.	m	Could you step away from the door  please?
TERRY	m	Well we just wanna --
RUDY SR.	m	Could you step away from the door  please?
TERRY	m	All right, all right.
RUDY SR.	m	What are you doin' here?
TERRY	m	I just wanted the kid to see you --
RUDY SR.	m	Well, now he saw me. Now you saw me. OK? Now would you mind?
TERRY	m	Man, you are really --
RUDY SR.	m	Look: I'm tryin' to be polite. So  would you just take off? It's OK:  Just take off.
TERRY	m	I just wanna --
RUDY SR.	m	Do you know what you're doin'? Just  get outta here!
TERRY	m	You know what, man? You're still a  fuckin' asshole.
RUDY SR.	m	I'm an asshole? Get outta here!
JANIE	f	Get your fuckin' hands off him...!
1ST COP	m	And you're not the boy's legal  guardian?
RUDY SR.	m	I don't even know if that's my kid!
JANIE	f	They just showed up! We never seen  them before...
RUDY SR.	m	I used to know his sister --
TERRY	m	I just came down here to talk to the  guy and all of a sudden he starts  shovin' me!
2ND COP	m	Listen up. Listen up. You're gonna  have to step back and just calm down --
TERRY	m	You're a lyin' fuckin' piece of shit.
2ND COP	m	You're gonna have to step back.
JANIE	f	We have a right to protect ourselves.  What else do you need to know?
2ND COP	m	Now give me your right hand...
TERRY	m	This is such bullshit. He started  the whole thing and you're arresting  me?
2ND COP	m	Listen up. Now -- Listen up! Stop  talkin'. Terry, stop talkin'.
2ND COP	m	-- idea where we might be able to  contact his mother?
RUDY SR.	m	No, because he's not my Goddamn kid.
SAMMY	m	What time is it?
BRIAN	m	What's the matter?
SAMMY	m	Oh my gosh.
BRIAN	m	Hey, you know, Nancy's gonna be gone  for the rest of the week...
SAMMY	m	You know... Brian...
BRIAN	m	Yeah?
SAMMY	m	Well, I don't want to... I mean,  couldn't we just... I mean, could we  give it a rest?
BRIAN	m	Um -- Yeah. Sure. If you want to.
SAMMY	m	I mean... I just think... I don't  know: We had a great little fling.  You know? Let's not push it. I mean, is that OK? I just --
BRIAN	m	Yeah. Sure. OK. You're right.
SAMMY	m	So are we still friends?
BRIAN	m	Mm hm. Sure.
SAMMY	m	All right. Good...!
SAMMY	m	Around two o'clock this afternoon...  Yeah, a ninety three Toyota Tercel.  New York plates V127AC... Please.
SAMMY	m	Thanks for coming over. I just want  to have a car handy just in case.
BOB	m	No problem.
SAMMY	m	Well -- what about other towns?...  Yes! Yes! I called the highway patrol  four times... Well what am I supposed  to do all night?
SAMMY	m	Hello?
BRIAN	m	Anyone hear from Sammy this morning?
MABEL	f	I didn't.
BRIAN	m	Uh huh. Well, if anyone ever hears  from her ever again, will you let me  know?
MABEL	f	Yes.
SHERIFF	m	It's gonna be all right... We got on  the phone and talked to Rudy Sr. a  little bit and he's calmed down,  just wants to forget about the whole  thing...
SAMMY	m	Darryl, I really appreciate this...
SAMMY	m	Hello?
BRIAN	m	Yeah, it's Brian.
SAMMY	m	Brian --
BRIAN	m	What the hell happened to you today,  lady?
SAMMY	m	Hello?
BRIAN	m	You're fired!
SAMMY	m	GOOD!
SAMMY	m	Rudy?
RUDY	m	Yeah?
SAMMY	m	Is there anything you want to ask  me, about your father?
RUDY	m	Oh, that wasn't my father.
SAMMY	m	What?
RUDY	m	That wasn't him. I heard him tell  the cops.
SAMMY	m	No -- Rudy -- that was him. But that  was him. I wish it wasn't, but it  was.
RUDY	m	No it wasn't.
SAMMY	m	Rudy. Yes it was. Your father's name  is Rudy Kolinski. He lives in  Auburn...
SAMMY	m	Could you turn that off for a minute  please?
TERRY	m	You don't have to say anything, Sammy.
SAMMY	m	I want you to leave.
TERRY	m	What do you mean?
SAMMY	m	I mean I don't think you should live  here anymore. I don't think you know  how to behave around an eight-year- old and I don't know how to make you  stop, so I think you shouldn't live  here. I don't know what else to say.
TERRY	m	I don't know how to behave around an  eight-year-old?
SAMMY	m	That's right --
TERRY	m	I think you don't know how to behave  around an eight-year-old.
SAMMY	m	Are you out of your MIND!?!
SAMMY	m	Now you just listen to me. I may not  be the greatest mother in the world,  but I'm doing the best I know how.  And he doesn't need you to rub his  face in shit because you think it's  good for him. He's going to find out  the world is a horrible place and  that people suck soon enough, and  without any help from you. Believe  me!
SAMMY	m	I think you should get your own place.  I thought, if you want, you could --  I'll be glad to help you out  financially --
TERRY	m	What do you mean, Get my own place?
SAMMY	m	I mean I --
TERRY	m	You mean in Scottsville?
SAMMY	m	Yes.
TERRY	m	Why would I do that? Why don't I  just leave, period?
SAMMY	m	Well... If that's what you want to  do, that's fine. But that's not what  I'm saying. You are a very important  person to Rudy, and you are the most  important person to me. But I'm saying  that I can't take any more of this --
TERRY	m	Well --
SAMMY	m	-- I thought -- maybe you could sell  your half of the house to me, and I  could pay you whatever it is over a  certain amount of time, and that way --
TERRY	m	No, you know what? I'll just go.
SAMMY	m	Well -- that's not what I'm saying.
RUDY	m	Where are you going?
TERRY	m	I don't know. I just want to get out  of this town. And if you've got any  sense when you get old enough you'll  get out of here too. Your Mom's gonna  live in this town for the rest of  her life, and you know why? Because  she thinks she has to. Don't ask me  why, but that's the truth. She thinks  there's all these things she has to  do, but you want to know one thing  about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck- up than I ever was. I mean, I know I  messed up. You think I enjoy getting  thrown in jail because I wanted you  to face that prick your Dad like a  little man and see what kind of a  guy he is? I know I got a little  carried away, and I lost my temper  just a little bit -- which is not  the end of the world either, by the  way, just for future reference --And  now she's kickin' me out of my own  house because -- you know, because I  fucked up a little bit. Which I  totally admit. I was like -- totally  ready to admit that.
RUDY	m	I could go with you.
TERRY	m	Well, thanks, man. But I, uh, I can't  really take care of you.
SAMMY	m	Is that for you?
TERRY	m	Yeah, I'm just gonna stay at Ray's  till I take off.
SAMMY	m	You don't have to do that.
TERRY	m	Yeah. Well, that's what I wanna do,  so --
SAMMY	m	Well but -- Are you gonna come back  to say good-bye?
TERRY	m	No -- I'm just gonna take off. I'll  see you later.
SAMMY	m	Well --
SAMMY	m	Look. I know you're upset about Uncle  Terry leaving, and so am I. But he's  just not in control of himself, and  I don't want him hurting your feelings  anymore -- or mine. And you may not  like it, but that's how it's gotta  be. OK?
RUDY	m	I don't care.
SAMMY	m	You don't care. I don't care either.
BRIAN	m	Well... I'm sorry you're havin' all  this trouble...
SAMMY	m	Thank you.
BRIAN	m	But you made a pretty good speech to  me yesterday about people sticking  to their commitments...
SAMMY	m	Yeah...?
BRIAN	m	Well... you made a commitment to  this bank, Sammy. To this job.
SAMMY	m	I know I'd --
BRIAN	m	And to working things out with this  tough new son of a bitch boss of  yours. And whatever might have passed  between us after hours doesn't mean  you just walk away from that  commitment -- yeah, even when you  have a legitimate family emergency.
SAMMY	m	I'm really sorry I didn't --
BRIAN	m	Which is why I think in the calm  cold light of day, we should both  think real hard about whether or not  you really want to continue on here  at Merchants National Trust.
SAMMY	m	You're not serious.
BRIAN	m	...you're not happy, I'm not happy,  it's not good for you and it sure as  heck isn't good for the bank.
SAMMY	m	You know you're the worst manager  we've ever had?
BRIAN	m	Come on, Sammy...
SAMMY	m	By far the worst.
BRIAN	m	...I don't wanna trade insults with  you.
SAMMY	m	Well, I don't want to be fired, Brian.  I've been working here for seven  years.
BRIAN	m	Well --
SAMMY	m	And if I were you I'd be a little  nervous about firing an employee I  just had an affair with. OK?
BRIAN	m	That's -- Don't threaten me, Sammy:  I'm not threatening you. I -- It's  just an area I think we should  explore.
SAMMY	m	I'm not thr -- You explore it. I'm  going back to work.
SAMMY	m	Oh, and I have to pick up Rudy today  because there's no one else to do  it. But I'll find someone as soon as  I have time.
BRIAN	m	Yeah. Fine. Why don't you just take  over the whole bank?
SAMMY	m	Well, I called where Uncle Terry  said he was gonna stay, and there  was no answer, so I don't know if  he's still in town or not.
SAMMY	m	Rudy? Are you not speaking to me?
SAMMY	m	Well, I'm sorry you're so mad at me,  but I only did what I thought I had  to do, and I hope you don't stay mad  at me for the rest of your life.
SAMMY	m	Rudy, that's too much.
SAMMY	m	You gotta cut this out!
RUDY	m	What did I do?
SAMMY	m	You don't know what you're talking  about! There was nothing else I could  do! I can't explain it better than  that, but you can't go on like this  because you don't know anything about  it and you don't know what you're  doing!
RUDY	m	OK, I'm sorry!
SAMMY	m	I don't want you to be sorry, I just  want you to STOP IT!
RUDY	m	I will! I will! I'm stopping, I'm  sorry.
RUDY	m	See? I'm stopping! I'm not doing it.  See? I'm not.
TERRY	m	Ray's house.
SAMMY	m	Hi.
SAMMY	m	I didn't know if you left yet.
TERRY	m	No -- I'm leavin' tomorrow.
SAMMY	m	Well -- What time?
TERRY	m	There's a bus at nine.
SAMMY	m	Well -- Can I -- I'd like to see you  before you go. I mean, can I give  you a lift? Or do you want to have  breakfast or anything? And I think  Rudy would really like to say good- bye.
TERRY	m	Yeah -- I don't know... I mean --
SAMMY	m	Terry, you can't just leave like  this. I --
TERRY	m	All right, all right. I'll come by  in the morning.
SAMMY	m	All right -- But just -- We have to  be out of the house by eight, so --  I don't want to tell Rudy you're  coming unless you really think you  can make it --
TERRY	m	Yeah -- No -- I'll be there.
SAMMY	m	All right.
TERRY	m	All right.
SAMMY	m	You should get your sneakers on.
SAMMY	m	Sweetie, I'm sorry, we have to go.
RUDY	m	Why can't I miss school one day?
RUDY	m	Hi!
TERRY	m	Hey, how's it goin', man?
TERRY	m	Sorry I'm late.
TERRY	m	So Rudy... If I write you a letter,  will you write me back?
RUDY	m	Yeah.
TERRY	m	OK, well, that's gonna be pretty  nice for you, because I write a pretty  Goddamn interesting letter.
RUDY	m	Yeah, we'll see.
TERRY	m	All right. Well, say good-bye.
RUDY	m	Bye.
SAMMY	m	Do you need some cash for the bus?
TERRY	m	No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you  gonna be late for work?
SAMMY	m	Oh -- Yeah. That's OK. Terry, I don't even know where you're  going.
TERRY	m	Oh, well, I didn't really have a  concrete plan yet. I have to go back  to Worcester and get my stuff...
SAMMY	m	Oh, are you gonna try to see that  girl?
TERRY	m	Well... Yeah... You know... Thought  maybe I'd try to show my face... Let  her brother have a crack at me...
SAMMY	m	What?
TERRY	m	No...
SAMMY	m	...I don't want anyone to have a  crack at you.
TERRY	m	I'm just kidding. I just thought...  Just thought I'd check up on her... Anyway, after that, I don't really  know. I've been thinking about Alaska  a lot. I still got some friends out  there. I don't really know. Anyway,  I'll write you.
SAMMY	m	You will?
TERRY	m	Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You  know that.
SAMMY	m	What is gonna happen to you?
TERRY	m	Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell  you, I know things didn't work out  too well this time...
SAMMY	m	Well, Terry --
TERRY	m	...but it's always really good to  know that wherever I am, whatever  stupid shit I'm doing, you're back  at my home, rooting for me.
SAMMY	m	I do root for you.
TERRY	m	Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna  be all right... Comparatively... And  I'll be back this way...
SAMMY	m	I feel like I'm never gonna see you  again...!
TERRY	m	Of course you will, Sammy. You never  have to worry about that.
SAMMY	m	Please don't go till you know where  you're going. Please...!
TERRY	m	I do know where I'm going. I'm going  to Worcester and I'm gonna try to  see that girl. And then depending on  what happens there, I thought I'd  try to see if there's any work for  me out West. And if there is, I'm  gonna head out there for the summer  and try to make some money. And if  there isn't, I'll figure something  else out. Maybe I'll stay around the  East. I don't know... I really liked  it in Alaska. It was really beautiful.  You just -- It made me feel good.  And before things got so messed up I  was doin' pretty well out there.  Seriously. But I couldn't stay here  long, Sammy: I don't want to live  here. But I'm gonna stay in touch.  And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to  see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll  come home for Christmas. How about  that? We'll have Christmas together. Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...
TERRY	m	Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look  at me...
TERRY	m	Hey, Sammy... Remember when we were  kids, remember what we always used  to say to each other . . .? Remember when we were kids?
SAMMY	m	Of course I do...!
