MONSIGNOR	m	Thank you Father Macklepenny, for  coming all the way across town to be  our guest speaker today. I hope you  found our little parish to your  liking.
ANNABELLE MACMANUS	f	They've never been like anyone else.  From the moment they were born, of  the same womb, on the same day, they  just had their own way, my boys did.  And I always knew that one day they  would do something of true greatness.  I just never expected they would  bring about such a... such a  reckoning.
MONSIGNOR	m	...and I am reminded of this holy  day of the sad story of Kitty  Geneviese. This poor soul cried out  time and time again for help but no  person answered her calls. Though  many saw, not one so much as called.  Her assailant wiped the bloody knife  off on her lifeless little body.  They watched as he simply walked  away. Nobody wanted to get involved.  Nobody wanted to take a stand... We  must fear evil men and deal with  them accordingly but what we must  truly guard against, what we must  fear most Is the indifference of good men.
CONNOR	m	I do believe the Monsignor finally  got a point.
MURPHY	m	Aye.
CONNOR	m	What?
MCGERKIN	?	Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle...  Gurtle.
ROZ	f	Rozengurtle Baumgartner.
MCGERKIN	?	You'll be training her today, and do  a good job.
BOTH BOYS	m	Aye.
CONNOR	m	Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.
ROZ	f	I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by  men.
CONNOR	m	Okay then... let's get ya started.
MURPHY	m	Christ, that's the largest woman  I've ever seen.
MCGERKIN	?	It's self-imposed affirmative action.  If we hire big, fat, angry lesbians,  then the leftist groups representing  big, fat angry lesbians, won't think  we're violating their rights.
MURPHY	m	Well, how politically correct you  are. That's good stuff.
MCGERKIN	?	Hey, those people can shut ya down.  They'll sue you into the ground  claiming they were put under mental  duress, inner pain. and sufferin'.
MURPHY	m	Well, as long as we're hirin' fat  lesbians, give your ma a call.
MCGERKIN	?	Fuck you Murphy.
CONNOR	m	Okay, just cut off as much fat as  you can as it goes by and the rule  of thumb here is...
ROZ	f	Rule of thumb?
CONNOR	m	Yeah?
ROZ	f	Do you know where that term comes  from? In the early 1900's it was  legal for men to beat their wives as  long as they used a stick no wider  than their thumb.
CONNOR	m	Can't do much damage with that.  Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of  wrist. Ha! Rule of wrist.
CONNOR	m	Hey Murphy?
MURPHY	m	Aye.
CONNOR	m	How many feminists does it take to  screw in a light bulb?
MURPHY	m	How many?
CONNOR	m	Two. One ta screw it in and one ta  suck my cock.
ROZ	f	I knew you two pricks would give me  problems. Give me shit cause I'm a  woman. I'm not gonna take your male  dominance bullshit!
CONNOR	m	Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was  just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
MURPHY	m	Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice  is all.
ROZ	f	Fuck you... ...and fuck you!
MURPHY	m	Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day.  It's all in good fun.
ROZ	f	Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck  face?
CONNOR	m	Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry.  Just relax.
CONNOR	m	Why don't you save all your aggression  for protests and marches and what  not.
ROZ	f	You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the  needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck  up! Leave him there.
MURPHY	m	Guess you'll have ta change that  tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!?
CONNOR	m	Fuck you.
CONNOR	m	Hello.
MOM	f	Connor, is that you?
CONNOR	m	Mother, is that you?
MOM	f	Is that worthless brother of your  there? I want you both ta hear this.
CONNOR	m	Ma, what's wrong?
MURPHY	m	No fuckin' hot water man. That...
CONNOR	m	Shut it. It's Ma.
MOM	f	It's all your fault. Both you little  bastards. I was a fool to believe  you would bring me any peace. The  day your Da left us when you were  almost too young to remember, he  said the two of you would do me right  and make me proud, but he was wrong  and I got nothin' ta live for.
CONNOR	m	Mother, what are you sayin'? You're  talkin' crazy here.
MURPHY	m	What's the matter with her?
MOM	f	I finally found your Da's army  revolver, Connor.
CONNOR	m	What the hell are you doin' with  Da's gun!?
MURPHY	m	What the...?
MOM	f	I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
CONNOR	m	What?! What are you doin'?
MOM	f	I want ta tell ya one last thing  before I pull the trigger.
CONNOR	m	Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it  woman?! Now just calm down here.
MURPHY	m	Oh my god!
MOM	f	I...
CONNOR	m	No ma! No!
MOM	f	BLAME...
CONNOR & MURPHY	m	Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma!
MOM	f	YOU...!
CONNOR	m	Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
MURPHY	m	Lord have mercy. That was a good one  ma.
MOM	f	Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No!
MURPHY	m	Oh, she's quite proud of herself.
MOM	f	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta  me now.
CONNOR	m	All right, we're both here.
MOM	f	It's only 11:00 here boys so I got  lot's more drinkin' ta do with your  worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
MURPHY	m	Just called ta torture us did ya?
CONNOR	m	How's Uncle Sibeal?
MOM	f	Well, you know how it is with him.  Always complainin' he's never turnin'  a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn  family goes down there with no money,  cause we know he can't bear ta charge  us.
MOM	f	But he's been havin' himself a nip  or two as well... Been up the  waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
MURPHY	m	Well you tell him ta take it easy  with that. He's gotta learn ta respect  women the way Connor does.
CONNOR	m	Oh, Jesus.
MURPHY	m	I gave him his first lesson in  sensitivity toward the fairer sex  just today.
CONNOR	m	Don't even do it, ya bastard.
MURPHY	m	He got beat up by a girl.
CONNOR	m	If that was a girl I want ta see  some papers. She had ta be just  preoperative for Christ sakes.
MOM	f	Lord's name.
BOTH	m	Mother Mary, full of grace.
MOM	f	What did you do, Connor?
CONNOR	m	Well, we tried ta make friends and  she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
MOM	f	What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya  trounced her a good one!
CONNOR	m	Well, I didn't but...
MURPHY	m	Don't worry, I respected the hell  out of her for ya, Ma.
MOM	f	Well listen, I know how my boys take  ta scrappin' when they take ta  drinkin'.
BOTH	m	Yes mother.
MOM	f	I mean it now. I carried the two of  you little bastards around in my  belly at the same time you ungrateful  pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure  in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked  me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles.  I trip over em for Christ sakes, now  ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
MOM	f	Promise me boys.
MURPHY	m	We promise.
CONNOR	m	Yeah, we promise.
MOM	f	Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused  a ruckus with that shot. Half the  damn neighborhood is comin'.
MURPHY	m	All right, love ya ma. Listen, before  ya go just give us the goods, eh?
CONNOR	m	Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
MOM	f	Still bickerin' over that, huh?
CONNOR	m	Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came  out first?
MOM	f	All right, I suppose you have the  right ta know.
MOM	f	Are ya ready?
BOTH	m	Aye.
MOM	f	The one with the biggest cock!
CONNOR	m	Crazy woman.
CONNOR	m	Don't start. I've had ice on mine.
GREENLY	?	...so these guys are just kickin'  the shit out of each other. This guy  Picks up an old kitchen sink that  some one threw out and crushes this  guy  With it. All right, so it makes a  big bang and alerts their friend,  who's standin' look out around the  corner. So he comes over and gets  into it with this guy,  He's angry at him, right? They get  into an altercation in which the  look out guy crushes this guy by  jumpin on him. And look at the damage  here. I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger  man. His spine is crushed. He's all  twisted and shit. That guy had to be  one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400  pounds, fuckin huge.
GREELY	?	Or, okay. Check this out. Say these  two don't even know the huge guy.  They're just staggerin' home from a  bar this morning, still all fucked  up from St. Patty's last night. So  they figure they'll take a short cut  down the alley and this big mother  fucker, he's just waitin'. And what  could be more perfect for strong arm  robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged  up. They're already injured for Christ  sakes. He takes a blunt object and  whacks the guy with the bandage on  his head, right? Cause he's smart.  He knows the guy with the bandage on  his ass, he ain't going nowhere.  Matter of fact, this guy's probably  helping his friend with the rectal  problem along. They're limping around  like a couple of decrepit old broads.  So once this guy's out of the picture this poor asshole, he tries to run.  But look how far he gets fore the  huge bastard catches up with him.  Only a few yards. And what does he  do? He gets creative. He picks up a  sink and crushes the poor mother- fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He  comes over here, jumps on this guy's  back and crushes him to death. He steals their shit and beats it!  Thanks for comin' out! And look at this print...
GREENLY	?	That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and  think about it. Of all the ways to  kill a guy, crushin' him to death.  That's very particular. You don't  get many of those. I dunno. I feel  something big here. I wouldn't be  surprised if we see more of these  turning up.
SMECKER	?	Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy  theory and Serial crusher theory.  Top fucking notch. What's your name?
GREENLY	?	Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are  you?
SMECKER	?	That's who the fuck I am.
CHIEF	m	Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on  this one. I.D. just came back on  these guys. They've got connections  to the Russian mob. That makes it a  federal matter and Agent Smecker,  here, is heading up the investigation  with our full cooperation.
SMECKER	?	Why don't you get me a cup of coffee.
GREENY	m	What the fuck?
SMECKER	?	Cafï¿½ latte.
GREENLY	?	Who the...
SMECKER	?	Twist of lemon!
GREENLY	?	Chief, what the fuck is this?
SMECKER	?	Sweet-n-low!
SMECKER	?	Mitchell, Langley!
MITCHELL	m	Yes sir.
SMECKER	?	Find the manager of this building.  See if he has had any complaints of  water coming down in any apartments,  starting just this morning. If he's  not there, knock on every door  starting from the third floor up.  Langley, you take this building,  same thing.
SMECKER	?	Chaffey, Newman.
CHAFFEY	?	Yes sir.
SMECKER	?	Look in the trash around their hands.  See if you can find me two bullet  casings. 45's, if my eye serves me  right. Don't disturb them. Mark them  as they lay. Newman, root through  this shit. If this was a sink find me some metal  parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain  cover or something.
CHAFFEY	?	Got it. It's a 45.
SMECKER	?	Chief, could you get ballistics down  here and tell them they have to dig  a 45 slug out of a brick wall.
SMECKER	?	...and locate another that's been  fired through a dumpster.
CHIEF	m	I got the best ballistics guy in the  world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff  right in the van. Can have him down  here in 10 minutes.
DOLLY	f	How did you know that?
SMECKER	?	Paraffin came up positive. And bullet  holes are usually a big clue.
CHAFFEY	?	I can't find the second one, sir.
SMECKER	?	Look under the body.
CHAFFEY	?	Got it.
SMECKER	?	You guy's ready for this?
SMECKER	?	This was no gangland assassination.  Though creative, it was way too  sloppy. Something went wrong here.  This has personal written all over  it. Now, these men were crushed and  the first natural reaction the body  has to such trauma is to tense up.  So now the two shots fired here were  reflex rounds. These guys weren't  shooting at anything, but they were  just about to.
MITCHELL	m	Agent Smecker, This is all illegal loft housing so  there's no manager on the premises  but I found a lady on the fourth  floor said she's had water dripping  down on her whole place. Started  just this morning.
SMECKER	?	Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading  to the fifth. Let's go up and see  just how right I am.
DUFFY	m	So what are you thinkin' here?
SMECKER	?	Really want to know?
GREENLY	?	No way. You know how big a guy's  gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.
SMECKER	?	Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel  with my coffee.
GREENLY	?	I ain't getting him no fuckin' bagel.
SMECKER	?	We'll start the ass kissing with  you.
MITCHELL	m	Agent Smecker. I know this  neighborhood pretty good. There's a  bar called McGinty's down the block.  It's a good bet they were there last  night.
SMECKER	?	Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that  out myself.
REPORTER	m	Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened  here? You owe me. This is the one I  want.
DUFFY	m	Let's go get a cup of coffee. You  ain't gonna fuckin' believe this  one.
SMECKER	?	I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more  uniforms on the streets. One thing's  for sure, wherever these guys are  they're hurting.
MURPHY	m	Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy.  He'll have his day. He'll have his
MURPHY	m	Thanks for comin', Doc.
DOC	m	J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are  ya b-boys all right?
CONNOR	m	We're alive.
DOC	m	An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He  left me his c-c, he left me his c-c,  he left me this.
DOC	m	Fuck!..........Ass!
DOC	m	What are you going to do?
CONNOR	m	We're going to turn ourselves in. It  was self defense.
DOC	m	y-y-yeah that's what he said.
MURPHY	m	How the fuck's he know that? We  haven't spoken to anyone yet.
DOC	m	Don't know. He didn't say.
MURPHY	m	Listen Doc, we need a favor.
DOC	m	A-anything.
CONNOR	m	Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be  comin back for it when we get out.
DOC	m	Right.
SMECKER	?	First of all, I'd like to thank  whichever one of you donut munching,  barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this  to the press. That's just what we  need now, some sensational story in  the papers making these guys out to  be super heroes, triumphing over  evil. And let me squash the rumors  now. These two aren't heroes. They are two ordinary men who were  put in an extraordinary situation  and they just happened to come out  on top. Yes, nothing from our far  reaching computer system has turned  up jack shit on these two. All we  know is what we found out from their  neighbors. And the general consensus  is that they're... angels. But angels don't kill and we got two  bodies in the morgue that look like  they've been...
SMECKER	?	...serial crushed by a huge fuckin'  guy.
CHAFFEY	?	Are these me considered armed and  dangerous?
SMECKER	?	Well, not armed. If they had guns,  they'd have used them. But dangerous?  Oh yeah.
MITCHELL	m	What makes you think they're  dangerous? They were just protecting  each other.
SMECKER	?	Look, look! I'm not saying one way  or the other. Just be careful and go  by the protocol on this one.
CHAFFEY	?	Any tips on where these guys may be?
SMECKER	?	Any word back from the E.R.s?
MITCHELL	m	No help at all. Swamped from St.  Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody  Irish.
SMECKER	?	Just hit the bricks nice and hard.
GREENLY	?	These guys are miles away by now.
GREENLY	?	But if you want to beat your head  against a wall, then here's what you  look for. These guys are scared like  two little bunny rabbits. Anything  in a uniform or flashing blue lights  will spook them. So the only thing  we can do is put a potato on a string  and drag it through South Boston.
MURPHY	m	You'd probably have better luck with  a beer.
SMECKER	?	What the fuck is this!? This isn't a  fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only  thing I want in here is them.
SMECKER	?	This conversation is going to be  recorded. Just answer to the best of  your knowledge.
MURPHY	m	Excuse me, sir.
MURPHY	m	"What do we tell him about the guns  and money?"
CONNOR	m	"We just got up and left. Bum musta  rolled them before the police got  there."
MURPHY	m	Okay. We're ready.
SMECKER	?	You guys are not under oath, here. I  am assuming you knew these two guys  from before, huh?
CONNOR	m	We... met them last night.
SMECKER	?	They had some pretty interesting  bandages. Know anything about that?
CONNOR	m	Would someone please come over here  and...
DOC	m	Fuck!
CONNOR	m	me up the...
DOC	m	Ass!
ROCCO	m	Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer!
ROCCO	m	...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm  just afraid of faggots.
DOC	m	I got some bad news. Looks like I'm  gonna have ta close d-down the bar.  The Russians have been buying up  buildings all over town, including  this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're  not letting me renew my lease. I got  'til the end of the week to come up  with 26,000 dollars, or they take  the place. I left them a note telling  them not to show their faces t- tonight. They been pressuring me ta  close and take the last few days ta  get all my shit outta here but it's  my right to stay open ta the last.
ROCCO	m	Let me talk to my boss, may I can...
DOC	m	L-l-listen I don't want anyone ta  know until the last possible moment.  So you guys keep your traps shut. ya  know what they say; People in glass  houses sink ships.
ROCCO	m	Y'know Doc, I gotta get you a, a,  like a proverb book or something.  This mix and match shit's gotta go.
DOC	m	What?
CONNOR	m	A p-penny saved is worth two in the  bush.
MURPHY	m	Don't c-cross the road if ya can't  get out of the kitchen.
CHECKOV	?	I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing  now.
MURPHY	m	This is McCoy... we find Spock and  we got enough for an away team.
CHECKOV	?	Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of  Irishmen... and they are being drunken  idiots. You are killing the  stereotype. I'm in no mood for  discussion. You! You stay. The rest of you go  now.
DOC	m	Why don't you make like a tree and  get the fuck outta here!
CONNOR	m	Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're  reasonable fellows.
CONNOR	m	Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til  this week's end. Ya don't have ta be  hard asses, do ya?
MURPHY	m	Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's  Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya  pull up a stool and have a drink  with us?
CHECKOV	?	You insult me. I would never drink  that sewage. Especially with you  people. You are fools.
CHECKOV	?	This is no game! If you won't go, we  will make you go!
CONNOR	m	If ya want a fight, you can see you're  outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil  here, so I suggest you take our offer.
CHECKOV	?	I make the offers, ass-hole.
ROCCO	m	Hey, there Boris. What would you say  if I told you that your pinko, commie  mother sucked so much dick...
CONNOR	m	"Now, that wasn't too polite, was  it?"
MURPHY	m	"I'm afraid we can't let that one  go, Ivan."
CONNOR	m	I don't think Ma would mind.
CONNOR	m	Let the boy go. He knows what the  fuck he's doing!
CONNOR	m	Nicely done, boy!
CONNOR	m	Now, like my fine brother says, on  St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And  this piece of shit is about to be  initiated.
FRIEND #1	m	Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck?
CHECKOV	?	I was going to kill you. But I'm  not... I'm going to kill your brother.  I'm going to take him down to the  dumpster and I'm going to shoot him  in the head. Then I'm going to throw  his dead body in the garbage. Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes,  gotta go.
MURPHY	m	It was just a bar fight. You guys  are fuckin' pussies!
CHECKOV	?	I hope your conscience is clear,  Irishman.
SMECKER	?	So, how is it that you guys are fluent  in Russian?
CONNOR	m	We paid attention in school.
SMECKER	?	Know any other languages?
MURPHY	m	Aye. Our mother insisted on it.  French.
MURPHY	m	How do you think he figured all this  out without talking to us?
CONNOR	m	Italian.
CONNOR	m	I have no idea. Maybe someone saw  and talked.
MURPHY	m	German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A  hundred percent Irish. No one talks  to cops. Period.
CONNOR	m	Spanish. Then I guess he's just real... real  good.
SMECKER	?	What are you guys doing working at a  fucking meat packing plant?
CHAFFEY	?	Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
SMECKER	?	What?
CHAFFEY	?	The press is everywhere outside.  They're going nuts for these guys.  What do you want to do?
SMECKER	?	You're not being charged. It's up to  you. Do you want to talk to them?
CONNOR	m	Absolutely not.
MURPHY	m	No pictures, either.
SMECKER	?	Well, we could try the bag over the  head thing. Walk you right out the  front.
CONNOR	m	Our mother can see through bags.
MURPHY	m	Aye, she can.  Any way we can stay here?
CHAFFEY	?	Sure, we have an empty holding cell,  They can... can they stay?
SMECKER	?	Well, we'll have to check with your  mother, but it's ok with me if your  friends sleep over.
SMECKER	?	Time to feed the dogs.
CONNOR	m	He's a nice guy.
MURPHY	m	Yes... he is.
CHIEF	m	This is our official statement. The  MacManus brothers are not being  charged with a crime. It was a clean- cut case of self defense. We have  thanked them for their cooperation  and we thank you, the media, for  your tireless pursuit of the truth.
CONNOR	m	Destroy all that which is evil...
MURPHY	m	...so that which is good may flourish
CONNOR	m	Be right back...
DUFFY	m	We would be honored, sir, if you  would join us peasants, in a donut.
MURPHY	m	Saints?   I will not accept this pizzle until  my feet have been properly anointed.
VINCENZO	m	Well, it's the funny man. Give it  here, package boy.
ROCCO	m	Joey Bevo said it was important.  Said I had to give it to him myself.
VINCENZO	m	Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the  fuck down!
VINCENZO	m	I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee  Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
ROCCO	m	Fuck you Vincenzo.
VINCENZO	m	Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
ROCCO	m	I caught your show down at the velvet  room at the Holiday Inn, loved it  when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
ROCCO	m	Hey, hey, hey...
YAKAVETTA	?	Fuck you! I could snap my fingers  and have you dead in four hours,  rotting in a truck off of Boyleston!  You insignificant little fuck! I  always get my fuckin' money!
YAKAVETTA	?	Fuckin' 90's are killin' me. I  shouldn't a done that. You're not  supposed to tell a guy you're gonna  kill him anymore. I gotta tip-toe  through the tulips with these  assholes. I prance. I'm a prancer.  It's what I do... sucked all the fun  right out of this job.
ROCCO	m	Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
YAKAVETTA	?	Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
YAKAVETTA	?	Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
ROCCO	m	Yeah boss?
YAKAVETTA	?	I always see you talking to the boys  and making them laugh. They always  come around telling me what a crack  up you are. What is it they call  you?
ROCCO	m	The... The funny man.
YAKAVETTA	?	The funny man. Well, I got a new job  for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having  a real shitty day. I'm depressed.  Tell me a funny story or a joke.
ROCCO	m	Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one  about the, no fuck that one... uh...  oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's  a white guy. He's walkin' along the  beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know  and ah, he rubs it and this genie  pops out. But this genie, he's a  ni... he's a black guy.
YAKAVETTA	?	He's a nigger.
ROCCO	m	Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He  says, "Why you crackers always gotta  find my mother fuckin' pot? And he  tells him he's gonna grant all his  three wishes but he's gonna give all  the black guys...
VINCENZO AND YAKAVETTA	m	Niggers!
ROCCO	m	Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the  planet get double what he wishes  for. "I'll take a million dollars,"  he says. Genie give it to him and  says every nigger on earth just got  two million. "I don't care gimme a  yacht." Poof there it is. E-every bl... every nigger just got  two yachts. Genie goes... I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This  joke sucks.
YAKAVETTA	?	Continue the joke.
ROCCO	m	He says, "What's your third wish?"  And the guys says, "I-I want you to  beat me half to death."
YAKAVETTA	?	Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good  stuff. Tell me another one.
CONNOR	m	Know what we need, man?... some rope.
MURPHY	m	For what?
CONNOR	m	Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
MURPHY	m	What?
CONNOR	m	Yeah, these guys always got a lot of  rope strapped around em in the movies  and they always end up using it.
MURPHY	m	Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
CONNOR	m	I'm serious.
MURPHY	m	Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing  we're gonna need it for.
CONNOR	m	I don't know they just always need  it.
MURPHY	m	What is all this "they" shit? This  ain't a movie.
CONNOR	m	Is that right, Rambo?
MURPHY	m	All right, get the stupid fuckin'  rope.
SMECKER	?	Uh,huh.  Room number.
SMECKER	?	We got a time of death?
SMECKER	?	What's the body count?
SMECKER	?	Uh, huh.
SMECKER	?	I'll be down there in a bit. Keep  the press out.
SMECKER	?	What are you doing?
REUBEN	m	I was just trying to cuddle.
SMECKER	?	Cuddle?...  What a fag!
SMECKER	?	He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
GREENLY	?	Why do you always disrespect me like  that?
SMECKER	?	Respect is earned, Greenly, never  given. Guys like you should have to  follow me around squabbling for the  scraps from my table.
SMECKER	?	How many bodies, Greenly?
GREENLY	?	Eight.
GREENLY	?	No! Shit! I didn't see that one.  Nine! Nine!
SMECKER	?	While Greenly's getting coffee,  anybody else want anything?
GREENLY	?	Shit! Shit!
SMECKER	?	So Duffy, got any theories to go  with that... tie.
DUFFY	m	These guys were pros. I think they  were coming for one target, the fag  man, he was the...
SMECKER	?	The what man?
DUFFY	m	The fat man.
SMECKER	?	Well, Freud was right. So you think  they came for the fag man, huh? And  what do you base this upon?
DUFFY	m	He was the only one done right. Two  in the back of the head.
SMECKER	?	And the pennies?
DUFFY	m	New hitman wants to leave his mark
SMECKER	?	That's a possibility. Y'know you  Boston cops are perking up. That's  two sound theories in one day, neither  of which deal with abnormally sized  men.  Another possibility is that they  were placed there with religious  intent.
DUFFY	m	Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies  in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
SMECKER	?	The Greeks. The Italians.
DUFFY	m	The Sicilians.
DOLLY	f	What's the symbology there?
SMECKER	?	Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has  relinquished his King Bone Head crown  I see we have an heir to the throne.  I'm sure the word you were looking  for was symbolism. What's the  symbolism there? Let me explain it  to you. In Greek and Roman mythology  when you died you would have to pay  the toll to Charon, the boatman who  ferried you across to the gates of  judgment. This made sure the dead  came to atone for what they did during  their lives, Detective...
SMECKER	?	Dollapoppaskalious.
DOLLY	f	Holy shit. You're the first one that's  ever got that.
SMECKER	?	Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology.
SMECKER	?	I've seen burns like these before.  They used silencers. Look at these  entry and exit wounds. They're  identical.
SMECKER	?	The two bullets went in here, through  the top of the skull, criss-crossed  and exited through the eyeballs.  This one clue tells us three distinct  facts. Number one... Duffy.
DUFFY	m	They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees.
SMECKER	?	Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
GREENLY	?	Uh.  Shit, I, uh...
SMECKER	?	It tells us that he was the last to  die. All these men  Were carrying. They came in, dropped  all in seconds and then took their  time with fag man. Didn't they,  Duffy?! They sure as fuck did!
SMECKER	?	And number three, Dolly.
DOLLY	f	Uh... two shooters!
SMECKER	?	Fan-fuckin-tastic!
SMECKER	?	Now stay with me, boys. What did  they do to make two such identical  wounds? Did one guy put him on his  knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up  and shoot him again the same way?  No. Two men of similar height dropped  this guy down, each put some iron to  his head and boom! That's all she  fuckin' wrote!
DUFFY	m	What about one guy with two guns?
SMECKER	?	Possible, but unlikely. The angles  are too extreme. A guy holding two  guns to the back of your head is  gonna shoot straight ahead. He  wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes  no sense. Besides, you telling me  one guy came in here and killed eight  men with eight extremely well aimed  shots in just a few seconds? No way.  Had to be at least two.
SMECKER	?	Television,... television is the  explanation for this.
SMECKER	?	You see this is bad television. The little assault guys creeping in  through the vents and coming in  through the ceilings. That James  Bond shit never happens in real life.  Professionals don't do that. So we've  got this up here, which has novice  written all over it. And all this  down here that's simply a perfect  textbook assassination. So here's  our two possibilities. We either  have rank amateurs that got lucky or  consummate professionals that fucked  up.
SMECKER	?	Join me in a drink, gentlemen.
SMECKER	?	With the exception of my coffee boy,  you Boston detectives are starting  to show signs of intelligence. So, I  am going to make you privy to some  information that you would not  normally be. These men are all Russian  mob. Not like those two peons in the  alley the other day. These guys are  all syndicate bosses and underbosses.  I have a dossier on every man in  this room. Since the Iron Curtain  has gone down, the Russian syndicates  have started to come here. And in  the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets  have opened their borders to the  mafia. But the Italians, they're not  convinced that the grounds in mother  Russia are fertile enough for  organized crime yet. So they ain't  ready to commit. The Russians are  coming here anyway. They are  unwelcome. What we have here,  gentlemen, is possibly the beginning  of the first international mob war...  unless I've totally missed something.
SMECKER	?	Now, what is this going to look like  to those who do not know what I just  told you?
DUFFY	m	It's gonna look like the bad guys  are killing each other.
SMECKER	?	And is there an American, shit is  there a man seated among us that  hasn't thought about it many times,  let's just put them all on an island,  give them guns and let them kill  each other. This is our wet dream  come true. You can expect federal  and local law enforcement to go only  deep enough to satisfy the law, then  bury it from here on out.
DOLLY	f	So, what do we do now?
SMECKER	?	That depends. You either do your job  or get ethical.
ROCCO	m	This better be good.  Talk!
MURPHY	m	Nervous?
CONNOR	m	A bit.
MURPHY	m	Me, too.
MURPHY	m	You and your fucking rope.
CONNOR	m	See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
MURPHY	m	Just like on TV.
MURPHY	m	Where the fuck are you going?
CONNOR	m	We'll find it. Just calm down.
MURPHY	m	No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit.  I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'  this stupid thing around. Must weigh  30 pounds.
CONNOR	m	We're doing some serious shit here.  Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
MURPHY	m	Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin'  Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's  getting' us lost!
CONNOR	m	Sh, sh! Fuck you!
MURPHY	m	No, fuck you!
BOTH	m	And shepherds we shall be. For thee,  my Lord, for thee. Power hath  descended forth from thy hand that  our feet may swiftly carry out thy  command. So we shall flow a river  forth to thee and teeming with souls  shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et  Fili e spiritu sancti.
CONNOR	m	That was some good fuckin' rope.
MURPHY	m	That was way easier than I thought.
CONNOR	m	Aye.
MURPHY	m	On TV ya always get that asshole  that jumps behind the couch.
CONNOR	m	Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for  ten minutes.
MURPHY	m	Oh, we're good man.
CONNOR	m	Yes, we are.
MURPHY	m	I love our new job.
ROCCO	m	Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the  same side! The boss musta sent you  in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please!  I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin' man!
CONNOR	m	Where's your gun?
ROCCO	m	Chest pocket.  Shit!
CONNOR	m	This is a six-shooter.
MURPHY	m	Nine bodies.
CONNOR	m	Oh, you're good. What were you gonna  do? Laugh the last three to death,  funny man?
ROCCO	m	Poppa Joe said there was only two.  In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job.  You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd  you get them?
CONNOR	m	Let's do him right here.
MURPHY	m	Right now.
ROCCO	m	Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no.  I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the  funny man... the funny.
ROCCO	m	What did you do?! Fuckin'... what  the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked  this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two  fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!
CONNOR	m	Certainly illustrates the diversity  of the word.
ROCCO	m	What the fuck are you doing here?  What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS!
CONNOR	m	Get a hold of yourself, man.
MURPHY	m	Yeah, get a hold of yourself.
CONNOR	m	Listen, we gotta get outta here now.  We'll take separate exits and meet  at Rocco's.
ROCCO	m	Fuck!
ROCCO	m	Anybody you think is evil?
CONNOR	m	Yes.
ROCCO	m	Don't you think that's a little  psycho? A little weird?
CONNOR	m	Weird, huh?... Know what I think is  weird? Decent men with loving families  go home every day after work. They  turn on the news and see rapists,  murderers, and child molesters all  getting out of prison.
MURPHY	m	Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos  and walkin' on bail the same day.
CONNOR	m	Little girls catchin' stray bullets  in their heads, playin' hopscotch in  their front yards. And everyone thinks  the same thing... Someone should  just go kill those motherfuckers.
MURPHY	m	Kill em all. Admit it, even you've  thought about it.
ROCCO	m	You guys should be in every major  city.
ROCCO	m	This is some heavy shit. This is  like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it!  There's so much shit that pisses me  off. You guys should recruit 'cause  I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin'  down the street waitin' for one of  these assholes to get me, y'know?
MURPHY	m	Hallelujah, Jaffar.
ROCCO	m	So you're not just talkin' mob guys.  You're talkin' anyone, right? Even  like pimps and drug dealers and all  that shit?
ROCCO	m	Well fuck, you guys could do this  every day.
MURPHY	m	We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always  doing business, but we're always  open.
CONNOR	m	Nicely put.
ROCCO	m	You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm  fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.
MURPHY	m	Who says that? You could take credit  on it.
ROCCO	m	What are you serious?
MURPHY	m	Yeah, fuck it. If you think about  it, it's all you can do really. You  can't tell him it was us. Go in  braggin' and shit.
CONNOR	m	Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don  Rocco.
ROCCO	m	Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it.  I've been working for those fat  bastards since I was in high school  and look at this place.
ROCCO	m	They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they  can suck my pathetic little dick.  And I'll dip my nuts in marinara  just so the fat fucks can get a taste  of home while they're at it. That's  it, it's done, I'm doing it.
MURPHY	m	I can't fuckin' believe that just  happened!
CONNOR	m	Donna's gonna be angry about her  cat.
ROCCO	m	Shit. She's on every drug know to  man. She'd have sold that thing for  a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
CONNOR	m	You sound real remorseful.
ROCCO	m	She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
CONNOR	m	Listen. Something's been bothering  me about last night.
ROCCO	m	What?
CONNOR	m	Well... what if your boss knew how  many guys were supposed to be there...  in that room?
ROCCO	m	What are you saying?
CONNOR	m	Think about it man. Nine men, six  bullets.
ROCCO	m	You think they sold me out? No way.
CONNOR	m	He probably knew you'd end up nailing  the fat guy, maybe one or two more,  but he had to know you weren't walking  out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's  dead on the scene. No in-depth  investigation. It'd slide right off  his back. 'Cause as much as I love  ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone.  What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
ROCCO	m	No, no. That's just not the way things  are done. Besides, how's he know I  don't just get in there see there's  too many and just serve em their  fuckin' food and beat it?
CONNOR	m	He knows you, man. He knows all you  want is to move up. That's all. A  smooth hitter woulda gone in there,  seen it was a wash and slipped out.  But a guy like you? Knowin' this is  your only chance? Waitin' eighteen  years?
ROCCO	m	No. No man. That's... that's... you  don't know what you're talking about.  That's bullshit. I know these guys.  I mean, thanks for your concern, but  that just ain't the thing of it.
CONNOR	m	Do me a favor and roll it around for  a bit on your way in.
ROCCO	m	No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs  to be rolled.
MURPHY	m	Where are you goin'? Did you tell him?
CONNOR	m	Yes.
MURPHY	m	Then what the fuck?
ROCCO	m	Hey. You don't know that shit for  sure.
MURPHY	m	Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin'  retard!
ROCCO	m	Fuck you!
MURPHY	m	Use your brain for once. Is it so  unbelievable they don't care about  you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in  there today. Dead!
ROCCO	m	Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know  what's going on, huh? Fuck you!
CONNOR	m	Hey, this ain't a thing you should  gamble on, Roc.
MURPHY	m	Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya  want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop.  This is the last time I'll see you.  Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
ROCCO	m	I'll be back at 9:00.
CONNOR	m	Hey. You get in there and start  getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out  quick.
MURPHY	m	Hello?
ROCCO	m	Hey Murph.
MURPHY	m	Roc. You okay?
ROCCO	m	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY	m	No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO	m	I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.
DONNA	f	Here kitty, kitty...... kitty.
DOLLY	f	She was in here when it went down.
SMECKER	?	Can she I.D. them?
DOLLY	f	They were wearing masks.
SMECKER	?	Of course they were. How many?
DOLLY	f	Three.
DOLLY	f	Only two did the shooting. So what are you thinking, Russian  retaliation?
SMECKER	?	Nah, too quick half their  infrastructure got taken out at the  Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a  hitter, you're either working for  the Russians or the Italians. There's  no riding the fence. Our little theory  from last night just got blown to  shit. Something... new is going on  here.
SMECKER	?	Probably shouldn't work another shift  for awhile.
DANCER	m	Fuck this job. I'm getting out of  the porno business and I don't care  who I gotta blow to do it.
SMECKER	?	After talking to the dancer we know  that their mark was the guy in the  middle booth. After she watches them  whack him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims?
GREENLY	?	Witness?
SMECKER	?	No way they could have seen it.
SMECKER	?	Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen  to the protocol of the porno industry,  as I'm sure you've never been in one  of these places before. A man goes  into the booth, puts the money in  the slot. The dancer gets it on the  other side. She hits the button,  door goes up, now there is only glass  between you and it's little fireman time.
DUFFY	m	No way they could have seen it?
SMECKER	?	Those doors were down... which means  this. They looked down in through  the peep hole, saw these guys and  opened the doors from the inside.  Pop, pop, pop, right through the  glass. Why?
DOLLY	f	Maybe the three of them had something  in common.
SMECKER	?	No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum.
GREENLY	?	Then that's what they had in common.  They were all bad guys... now they're  all dead bad guys.
SMECKER	?	We got another thing to think about  here. We got us a genuine Kennedy  assassination style bullet theory.  Two guns were used here, guns A and  B. The guy in the middle was done  with both. But this guy... ...he was killed with bullets from  gun A only. And this guy... ...gun B only. But ballistics dug  two slugs out of the wall from over  here where the victim was done with
SMECKER	?	And it's the same story over here.  Why the crossover? Theories.
DOLLY	f	That's just fucking weird. I have no  idea.
DUFFY	m	Jesus. I just can't think anymore.  That scene over at the coffee shop  today tapped me out.
SMECKER	?	What?
DUFFY	m	A guy went nuts over off of  Commonwealth today. Shot three guys  to death in a coffee shop in broad  daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have  much on him.
SMECKER	?	Why was I not informed of this?
GREENLY	?	They weren't related. The guy used a  38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
SMECKER	?	Who were the victims?
GREENLY	?	A couple of peons for the mob and...
SMECKER	?	Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the  scumbags in the quiet city of Boston  start dropping dead and you think  it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I  want the Boston Police doing my  thinking for me, I will have a fucking  tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad  car and get me over there. I want  the crime scene photos and any witness  statements. NOW!
SMECKER	?	Oh... it looks like we got us a  cowboy.
SMECKER	?	The shooter knew these guys, huh?
DOLLY	f	How do you figure?
SMECKER	?	Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.
SMECKER	?	These guys were packing. Not one  hand near a gun. It's simple human  behavior. Someone you don't know  approaches you, you put your hand on  it. This guy's got his hands on the  table. He's eating his food, for  Christ sakes. They were friends.
SMECKER	?	These two fucking scenes are related.  Too many coincidences. Same day?  Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on  both scenes. Now, why did he kill  the bartender?
DUFFY	m	Crime of passion. He just went nuts.  He would have shot everyone in here.  He just ran out of bullets.
SMECKER	?	Duffy. This look like a fucking post  office to you? This guy came in here  with intent. Maybe he didn't know  exactly what he was gonna do but he  had a pretty good idea. The bartender  wasn't a fucking accident.
DUFFY	m	Well, we didn't get any help on that.  A lot of people saw it. Nobody's  talking.
SMECKER	?	Fucking figures. Look, are you guys  seeing the pattern here? We got big  questions at both of these crime  scenes, with no answers. WHY did  they kill the guys in the other two  booths? WHY did he do the bartender?  It would seem unnecessary, even  stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm  fucking leaving now. And do me a  favor, tell me when the next guy  dies, cause these guys are not done  yet.
MURPHY	m	Hello?
ROCCO	m	Hey, Murph.
MURPHY	m	Roc. You okay?
ROCCO	m	Yeah. Anybody call for me?
MURPHY	m	No. You sure you're okay?
ROCCO	m	I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side.
ROCCO	m	Pack your shit! We gotta get outta  here! We gotta get out!
CONNOR	m	What happened?
ROCCO	m	I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em  all!!
DONNA	f	Rocco?
MURPHY	m	Hey, hey. Just calm down. Tell us  what happened!
ROCCO	m	No! Fuck you! You start getting  excited! We gotta fucking go!
DONNA	f	Rocco!
CONNOR	m	Who did you kill?
MURPHY	m	Holy shit. Who? How many?
ROCCO	m	Hurry the fuck up!
MURPHY	m	This is some crazy shit, man!
ROCCO	m	Those cocksuckers sold me out!
CONNOR	m	Did I fuckin' tell ya, Rocco? They  pull on you first?
DONNA	f	ROCCO!
ROCCO	m	What did I fuckin' do?... in the  middle of the Lakeview.
CONNOR	m	Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
MURPHY	m	Ha! Ha! Roc, you got a jumbo set of  coconut balls man!
DONNA/RAYVIE	?	ROCCO!
ROCCO	m	What?
DONNA	f	Where's my cat?
ROCCO	m	I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie  bitch!
DONNA	f	You... oh god, why?
ROCCO	m	I felt it would bring closure to our  relationship!
DONNA	f	You killed my... my...
ROCCO	m	Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
DONNA	f	My, my...
ROCCO	m	Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself  in the head, you can tell me that  cats name! Go ahead... Your what?  Your precious little...
DONNA	f	Pee...Per...Man.
ROCCO	m	Peeperman? WRONG? What color was  it?!!!
DONNA	f	It was... It was...
ROCCO	m	Male or female, bitch?!!
RAYVIE	m	Don't you yell at her you fuckin'  prick!
ROCCO	m	Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't  buy a pack of smokes without running  into nine guys you fucked.
DONNA	f	Don't you yell at her!
ROCCO	m	All right, let's get the fuck outta  here!
RAYVIE	m	Is my... I mean it's not really...?
DONNA	f	No. No. It's not fat.
ROCCO	m	Those rat fucks! All of them were  all laughing at me man!
MURPHY	m	You sure you killed them?
ROCCO	m	Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam  turkey shoot over there.
VINNIE	m	I'll bet it was a test. Vincenzo  came in here shooting his mouth off.  He was makin' sure we knew. But we  did what we were supposed to, eh? We  kept our mouths shut. You did your  part. They know we're goodfellas  now. We'll get taken care of.
ROCCO	m	What? Did everyone know? Next thing  you'll tell me Sal was in on it.
OLY	f	Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That  fat fuck knew before we did.
OLY	f	At least we got our funny man back.
CONNOR	m	Anybody see ya?
ROCCO	m	Fuck, man! I may as well have posted  flyers. Right out in public, man.
MURPHY	m	Liberating isn't it?
ROCCO	m	Y'know it is, a bit.
ROCCO	m	Stop the car!
ROCCO	m	Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker,  Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one  who set me up. Then he went around  shooting his mouth off, telling  everyone I was as good as dead. He  goes in there every Wednesday night  around 10:00, he jerks off in the  same booth to the same titty dancer.  Never misses.
MURPHY	m	So?
ROCCO	m	So let's kill the motherfucker. I  mean, what are you guys... like that's  your new thing right?
CONNOR	m	Yeah, well...
ROCCO	m	Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys  decide who you're... I mean, who  makes the cut? Is there a raffle or  something?
MURPHY	m	Well, truth be known, those first  ones just kinda fell into our laps.
ROCCO	m	Well, what'ya do?
CONNOR	m	I guess we really don't have a system  of deciding who.
ROCCO	m	MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know  everyone, their habits, where they  hang out, who they talk to. I know  where they fuckin' live. We could  kill everyone!
MURPHY	m	So what do you think?
CONNOR	m	I'm strangely comfortable with it.
MURPHY	m	Okay Roc, this is...
ROCCO	m	What? You guys got masks.
MURPHY	m	You look like Mush Mouth from Fat  Albert.
ROCCO	m	Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she  can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin'  to be professional, but no...
CONNOR	m	No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it  back on. It's good.
CONNOR	m	Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B?
ROCCO	m	Which one is he in?
ROCCO	m	What's his routine?
DANCER	m	H... h... he jerks off in there.  Th... then he puts money through the  slot and I raise the door.
MURPHY	m	How?
ROCCO	m	Then what?
DANCER	m	He watches me do my thing and f- finishes himself off.
VINCENZO	m	Don't you talk to me like that, you  dirty little... give it to daddy...  give it ta da King... garbage mouth,  garbage mouth.
ROCCO	m	Oh man. He is some sicko.
CONNOR	m	You've earned this.
CONNOR	m	What the fuck are you doing?
ROCCO	m	I-I'll tip her.
MURPHY	m	We've teamed up with a sex offender.
CONNOR	m	So, when are you getting a plastic  fuck doll?
ROCCO	m	All right. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.
ROCCO	m	What? What is it?
CONNOR	m	This place is like a scumbag yard  sale.
MURPHY	m	We gotta come down here once a week  and clean house.
ROCCO	m	You sure about this guy?
ROCCO	m	Oh man. You gotta let me do these  guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make  up for the tit thing.
CONNOR	m	No way. I've been waitin' for this  asshole.
ROCCO	m	Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family  name here. I've brought shame to the  house of Della Rocco.
MURPHY	m	Give the guy a shot.
CONNOR	m	Rocco, this is the real deal. We  must kill without hesitation, without  guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead  man.
ROCCO	m	Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man!
ROCCO	m	You guys gotta teach me that prayer,  man. That's some good shit.
CONNOR	m	Forget it. It's a family prayer. My  father, his father before him that  sort of shit.
ROCCO	m	C'mon!
AUGUSTUS	m	Fuck you.
YAKAVETTA	?	Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I  got a serious problem here. I'm not  screwing around.
AUGUSTUS	m	I bounced you on my knee at family  reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad  and me ran the whole east coast  syndicate you snot-nosed little prick.  And when you took the wheel, who was  beside you?
YAKAVETTA	?	Hey, I just...
AUGUSTUS	m	Don't start with your shit. Don't  you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy,  thanks for years of service. Here's  a gold watch and a job sniffing other  guys' shit eight hours a day. What  am I, a retired bus driver?
YAKAVETTA	?	I need Il Duce.
AUGUSTUS	m	The Duke?  What did you do?
YAKAVETTA	?	This kid, this package boy could  bring down the whole east coast. If  he decides to turn states he could  dismantle us... totally. But it looks  like for now, he's content with just  killing us one by one. And even worse  the kid is good at it. I mean I had  a prodigy on my hands the whole time  and didn't even know it.
AUGUSTUS	m	Listen kid, I think you better  understand who you're dealing with  here.
YAKAVETTA	?	Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen  when you guys used to talk about  him, like he was a ghost or something.
AUGUSTUS	m	Your dad and I used him three times  over twenty years, only when  everything went totally fucked.  Believe me kid, you don't want this  guy unless you are 100% sure you  need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
MR. COBB	m	Do you feel you have been  rehabilitated?
AUGUSTUS	m	I've had this guy in front of me,  and I couldn't tell you what he looks  like, sounds like. He is the Picasso  of assassins, kid. He plants hair  samples, blood. Puts skin under  fingernails. He is a fucking genius.  Only one problem. He's been rotting  in prison for twenty-five or thirty  years. Don't even know if he's still  alive. Or if he's even up to it.
YAKAVETTA	?	There's ways around that.
AUGUSTUS	m	Go find one.
ROCCO	m	Let's talk some business here. I  know a sick fuck... makes the ones  we been doing look like altar boys.  Worst night of my life when I met  this guy.
ROCCO	m	The guy never says a fuckin' word to  me. We're driving for 25 minutes.  Never a sigh, no throat clearing,  nothing. And his face, blank man.  Just nothing there.
ROCCO	m	I didn't see what he was doing while  he was in there.
THE MAN	m	I have a poker game at the house  every Saturday with a couple of guys  you know. Why don't you come down?  Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que.
ROCCO	m	Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me  something. What did they do?
THE MAN	m	I don't know.
ROCCO	m	Worst day of my life, man.
MURPHY	m	Well, I'm sold.
CONNOR	m	Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy  right and you'll feel a lot better.
CONNOR	m	Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know  you fuckin' know!
ROCCO	m	Fuck you! I told you I never saw him  before!
MURPHY	m	Well he sure as fuck knew you!
ROCCO	m	Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was  aiming at you!
SMECKER	?	Okay. Here's what happened.
SMECKER	?	They waited in a parked car down the  street for the kid to leave.
MURPHY	m	There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to  bring this man into the light? Are  we ready to truly do the work of the  Lord?
CONNOR	m	A-fuckin'-men!
ROCCO	m	This is so fuckin' cool!
SMECKER	?	They went in through the garage. The  kid says he leaves it open when he  takes his bike out.
SMECKER	?	Now, they know the wife is the gate  keeper. She knows the code.
ROCCO	m	Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill  you.
SMECKER	?	The wife says she doesn't know what  happened after she hit the code. She  just remembers going down. But,  judging by the burn mark on her back,  I think what they did...
SMECKER	?	...was use a stun gun on her.
SMECKER	?	Now the guy knows a friend is coming  to the game. And they know that this  door can only be opened from the  inside. So they wait... and when  that door opens, man...
ROCCO	m	All of them.
SMECKER	?	Nobody was ready for it. Devastation,  panic! This was like shooting fish  in a fuckin' barrel!
SMECKER	?	Now these guys dove under the table.  The trajectory on the bullets show  they came from straight across. So  this means one of our shooters...  dropped to his knees...
ROCCO	m	Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.
MURPHY	m	What the fuck do you mean?
ROCCO	m	I mean he ain't here.
CONNOR	m	Look again for fuck sake!
ROCCO	m	I know what the fuck he looks like!
SMECKER	?	Something went wrong. Right here.
CONNOR	m	Let the boy go!
MURPHY	m	C'mon Roc!
SMECKER	?	Now, one of these guys is a real  sicko. He knew this man. He wanted  him to suffer, to feel every second  of a painful death.
ROCCO	m	Help me you assholes!  He's gonna fuckin' kill me!
SMECKER	?	This guy is one bad motherfucker.
ROCCO	m	I don't wanna die!!!!!
SMECKER	?	I've never seen wounds like these  before, but whatever he used on this  guy, it was a blunt object and they  took it with them.
SMECKER	?	They exited out the front door. And  they had no fucking idea what they  were in for.
SMECKER	?	Now they are staring at six guys  with guns drawn. It was a fucking  ambush.
SMECKER	?	And this was a fucking bomb dropping  in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few  seconds this place was Armageddon!  There was a fire fight!
IL DUCE	m	No!... No! No!...
GREENLY	?	What if it was just one guy with six  guns?
SMECKER	?	Why don't you let me do the thinking,  huh, genius?
SMECKER	?	What is taking so long with those  blood samples?
FORENSICS WOMAN #1	f	I can't get a good sample. There is  variable here I'm not seeing.
SMECKER	?	They used ammonia... none of this  shit is any good... Fuck... You know  what this means?! Even if we get  suspects in this case, we got  nothing... Nothing!
SMECKER	?	Who the fuck are they?! I've never  seen any-fucking-thing like this in  my whole fucking life. Who the fuck  are they?!!
DUFFY	m	What? That's it?!
CONNOR	m	Shit.
ROCCO	m	What? What, that guy?
MURPHY	m	That's the guy that got us off the  hook with the "Checkov" thing.
CONNOR	m	And he is one smart man.
ROCCO	m	They got nothing.
CONNOR	m	This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't  figured us out yet, he will.
MURPHY	m	You bet your ass he will.
ROCCO	m	Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
CONNOR	m	He isn't to be touched.
MURPHY	m	He's a good man.
ROCCO	m	Okay... whatever. My Mom's gonna kill me.
SMECKER	?	No. This is all wrong. David Della  Rocco?
MARIA	f	Boston Police Department.
SMECKER	?	Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could  you find me the visitor's list for  the day the MacManus brothers were  in and read me all the names?
SMECKER	?	Okay, thank you.
BARTENDER	m	You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are  you sure you...
SMECKER	?	Pour the drink, faggot-ass!
SMECKER	?	Okay... But I don't cuddle.
ROCCO	m	Hey! We gotta talk about this early  morning church shit.
MURPHY	m	We have to go now. We're on the lamb.
ROCCO	m	You gonna do what I say, got it?
PRIEST	m	Yes.
ROCCO	m	I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see  this. Don't look at me!
PRIEST	m	I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
ROCCO	m	Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
PRIEST	m	Don't do this my son.
ROCCO	m	Open it!
PRIEST	m	Have you no fear of God?
ROCCO	m	That's who I'm doing this for, now  open the fuckin' thing.
ROCCO	m	Father, I'll do you right here.
PRIEST	m	God have mercy on my soul.
CONNOR	m	You little fuck. Let him go. I'll  drop you right here.
ROCCO	m	Okay, just calm down. He could hurt  us, brother. He could ruin the whole  thing.
CONNOR	m	Let him go or I will deliver you,  right now.
ROCCO	m	You won't do it Connor, you won't.  You love me man.
SMECKER	?	Hello? You there?
PRIEST	m	Y-Yes my son.
ROCCO	m	Do your thing Father. Don't fuck  this up.
PRIEST	m	What do you want me to say?
ROCCO	m	Just be natural, goddamit.
PRIEST	m	How long since your last confession,  my son?
SMECKER	?	Oh, Christ, uh, I've never confessed.
SMECKER	?	According to the dogma of the Catholic  church, I should probably burst into  flames right here in this booth. But  I've come here for advice, not  salvation.
PRIEST	m	Why have you come to a church for  council if you're not religious?
SMECKER	?	Why have I come to a church? I never  have before. I guess I just... felt  I should.
PRIEST	m	What is it my son?
SMECKER	?	It's ethics. I put evil men behind  bars, but the law has miles of red  tape and loopholes for these...  cocksuckers to slip through. I've  found out there are these two young  men who fix the situation with an  iron fist. As if they have God's  permission. But what they do is wrong  and I should arrest them...  technically.
PRIEST	m	God's permission? God doesn't...
SMECKER	?	But in this day and age I believe  what they do is... necessary. I feel  it is... correct.
PRIEST	m	You believe?
SMECKER	?	Yes.
PRIEST	m	You feel?
SMECKER	?	Yes.
PRIEST	m	You feel? A soul is what gives you  feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or  wrong. It is a conduit through which  the Lord speaks to us. You felt that  your answers would be here in the  house of God today. You feel these  men are necessary. The Lord has spoken  to you twice this day.
SMECKER	?	Has he now?
PRIEST	m	You have entered the house of the  Lord of your own free will speaking  of beliefs and feelings. Is it so  much to believe that God has brought  you here?
SMECKER	?	I guess not.
PRIEST	m	It is easy to be sarcastic about  religion. It is harder to take small  hints from God, your feelings and  listen to them... to take a stand.
SMECKER	?	You're right.
PRIEST	m	Those who do not act are in a constant  state of ethical indecision.
SMECKER	?	I want to stand for what I believe  in, father.
PRIEST	m	Then you must find out what your  beliefs are.
SMECKER	?	I believe these young men are right.
PRIEST	m	You know them personally?
SMECKER	?	Yes.
PRIEST	m	Do you think they would harm an  innocent man, for any reason?
SMECKER	?	No. They would never do that.
SMECKER	?	Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't.  But the Italian guy, he might. He's  kind of an idiot.
ROCCO	m	Goddam right, I am.
SMECKER	?	I'm beginning to see. I've been doing  my job... well for fifteen years and  it's just not enough. All the things  I wish I could do, these guys are  doing. Millions of dollars in tax  payers' money wasted on shit like  wire taps and surveillance. Theses  boys go in and take care of it for  the price of a bullet. Ww-what do you think I should do?  Because I'm a law man.
PRIEST	m	The laws of God are higher than the  laws of man.
SMECKER	?	Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too.  No. I was feeling it. All I needed  was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll  help them.
PRIEST	m	Forgive me father.
SMECKER	?	Thank you, Father, thank you. Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
ROCCO	m	I wouldn't have, uh, killed you,  Father.  Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're  bound. You can't talk about this...  to anyone.
PRIEST	m	Just go!
ROCCO	m	The Lord works in mysterious ways.
SMECKER	?	That's all you can give me?
CONNOR	m	Well, the light caught the side of  his face for a second. And it looked  like he had a gray beard, maybe...  late fifties, early sixties.
SMECKER	?	So you're telling me it was one guy  with six guns? A-and he was a senior  fucking citizen?
CONNOR	m	I think it's better if we find this  man before he finds us again.
SMECKER	?	I'll see what I can do. How do I get  in touch with you?
CONNOR	m	We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight,  right in the comfort of his own home.  Then we move on to New York. It's  getting a bit hot for us here.
SMECKER	?	Be careful.
CONNOR	m	I'll call you tonight, afterwards.
AUGUSTUS	m	I don't know who he is. Nobody does.
SMECKER	?	What did he bring him in for?
AUGUSTUS	m	Needed an outsider. The package boy  knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters  a mile away.
SMECKER	?	Just for him?
AUGUSTUS	m	Well he's the one shooting up all  his guys, right? He's scared of the  kid. Says he's real good, got every  available gun in the city up there.
SMECKER	?	Up where?
AUGUSTUS	m	Up his house. I don't know what's  going on but I know it's gotta have  something to do with this kid.
SMECKER	?	Oh fuck!
YAKAVETTA	?	You gonna tell me what's going on  here?! Huh! You little fuck! Gimme  some answers!
YAKAVETTA	?	What do you guys think?
GENO	?	They're tough. No way they're gonna  talk.
HOJO	m	I know Rocco. He ain't smart enough  for this shit. These other guys are  the brains. He's just a player.
YAKAVETTA	?	There's only one way to get them to  talk.
ROCCO	m	You guys?
CONNOR	m	We're here brother.
ROCCO	m	You gotta keep going.
MURPHY	m	We'll keep going, Roc.
ROCCO	m	You'll make it outta here. You can't  ever stop, not ever.
CHAPPY	m	Once you set him in motion, you can't  call him off. He thinks it's still  on.
YAKAVETTA	?	Oh Jesus Christ!
HOJO	m	What? I...
YAKAVETTA	?	Hey, I don't have my name spray  painted on the front of this house.  There are no big pictures of me  anywhere. If this guy thinks the job  is still a go then I got green money  says the mother fucker's out in the  bushes already. I'm fucking gone!  I'm leaving you guys to deal with  this.
GENO	?	One fucking guy, so what.
HOJO	m	Why don't you take the front. You guys cover those other exits and  if you see him, don't flag him down,  just kill the mother fucker. I'm  going back down to work on these  pricks.
SMECKER AS WOMAN	f	Joey Bevo sent me over. As  entertainment.
GENO	?	Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night  for this shit.  Bevo's so great. Always sending us  hot girls.
SMECKER	?	You look like you could use a quickie.
GENO	?	Hey, Chappy!
CHAPPY	m	What the fuck?
GENO	?	I ain't been laid in a week. Take  five minutes.
CHAPPY	m	If I die cause you're getting a piece  of ass, I'll come back and beat you  to death with a big rubber dick.
GENO	?	Don't worry about it.
CONNOR	m	How far are we going with this, Da?
FATHER	m	The questions is not, "how far?" The  question is, "Do you possess the  constitution, the depth of faith to  go as far as is needed?"
MEDIA MAN 1	m	Look at his charisma. He's the next  John Gotti.
MEDIA MAN 2	m	He'll walk. Even with all this  evidence.
MEDIA MAN 1	m	Look. All Yakavetta's people are on the  right. All the families of the men  he has killed are on the left.  Everyone wants some justice.
MEDIA MAN 2	m	Look at him. He doesn't have a care  in the world. He's gonna walk.
FATHER	m	How long do these put a man down  for?
MURPHY	m	Ten minutes.
FATHER	m	Twenty is a bit better.
JUDGE	m	Due to the lack of hard evidence......
FATHER	m	All media to the back! Drop the  cameras! Drop 'em!
FATHER	m	You people have been chosen to reveal  our existence to the world. You will  witness what happens here today and  you will tell of it afterwards.
YAKAVETTA	?	Fuckin' do something!
FATHER	m	You must watch dear. It'll all be  over soon.
CONNOR	m	Now, you will receive us.
MURPHY	m	We do not ask for your poor or your  hungry.
CONNOR	m	We do not want your tired and sick.
MURPHY	m	It is your corrupt we claim.
CONNOR	m	It is your evil, who will be sought  by us.
MURPHY	m	With every breath we shall hunt them  down.
CONNOR	m	Each day we will spill their blood  till it rains down from the skies.
MURPHY	m	Do not kill, do not rape, do not  steal. These are principles which  every man of every faith can embrace.
CONNOR	m	These are not polite suggestions.  They are codes of behavior and those  that ignore them will pay the dearest  cost.
MURPHY	m	There are varying degrees of evil.  We urge you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross  over into true corruption... into  our domain.
CONNOR	m	For if you do, there will come the  day when you look behind you and see  we three. And on that day you will  reap it.
MURPHY	m	And we will send you to whatever God  you wish.
REPORTER 2	m	Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss?  Did you see?
WOMAN	f	Yes. I was there.
REPORTER	m	How do you feel about what they did?
WOMAN	f	I guess we all know what is right  and wrong. We all know. Nobody needs  to be convinced of what he was...  I'm going home now to have my first  real full night's sleep.
