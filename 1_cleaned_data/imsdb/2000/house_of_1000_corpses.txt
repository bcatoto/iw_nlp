GIRL	f	Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest  little guy. Then one day he got sick  and died. My heart was broken. My  whole body hurt.
GIRL	f	After that, I saw things differently,  everything could be summed up with  three simple words... fuck the world.
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's  Halloween monster weekend. I'm Jimmy  Ray and I'll be bringing you the  oldies, the goldies and sometimes  the moldies. The good, the bad and  the uglies straight from the WJRC  vaults.

STUCKY	m	Well, yeah... I think that if you  knew him... I mean if you'd understand  his urges, shit the guy's like forty  or something.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
STUCKY	m	Yeah, I guess, you know next to  wacking his weasel his other favorite  thing is twisting sharpened pencils  in the corner of his eyes.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	What?
STUCKY	m	Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just  spins it around next to his eyeball.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	I'm sure that ain't the only place  he's sticking those pencils.
STUCKY	m	Naw, he don't do anything else with  'em, but he did get caught once with  a Planet of the Apes doll hanging  out his asshole.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Goddamn.
STUCKY	m	Had to take him to the hospital. Kid  had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his  butt, couldn't get it out.

RICH	m	Yeah, don't move or I'll blast a  hole the size of a Kansas City melon  through your ugly-ass Bozo face.
KARL	m	Go get that other asshole out of the  shitter and drag his ass back in  here.

CAPT. SPAULDING	m	That's what you bitches need. A  reality check courtesy of my boot in  your ass. That'll be a fucking cash  box you can cry to mamma about.
RICH	m	Come on, fatboy!

CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Fuck your grandmother.
STUCKY	m	Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the  shop teacher use'ta call you Little  Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song  we made up to go with that?
RICH	m	Shut up!
STUCKY	m	Little Dick Wick, play with his prick  Don't his smell, just make you sick.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	And most of all... fuck you!
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	God damn it, that motherfucker got  blood all over my best clown suit.
JERRY	m	Alright then, out of all of Charlie's  chicks who do you think is the  hottest?
BILL	m	I guess if I had to choose I'd say...  mmmmmm... Sandra Good. She seemed  like a nice girl, I mean in a psycho  kind of way.
JERRY	m	Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd  say Lynette Fromme. She's got that  snooty vibe I know you dig.
BILL	m	Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
JERRY	m	She's pretty cute.
BILL	m	Yeah but, she reminds me of this  chick that I remember from fourth  grade... called a... shit, what did  we call her? Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when  ever she got called on by Miss  Chumski, this chick would piss in  her pants and start bawling.
JERRY	m	There always one kid with no bodily  controls. We had this dude, Jeff  Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker  would just sit there puke all over  himself.
BILL	m	Better than pissing... anyway so,  what's your choice?
JERRY	m	If we're talking cute... like regular  cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but  cute ain't hot.
BILL	m	Yeah, no shit.
JERRY	m	As far a hot... goes I gotta go  with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
BILL	m	Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was  pretty hot.
JERRY	m	Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult  to get some of that... and the best  part is she didn't try to kill the  President or nothing, so that baggage  ain't hanging around.
BILL	m	I thought she tried to murder a  witness for the prosecution.
JERRY	m	I'll let it slide, she was only  seventeen.
BILL	m	Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't  no carry-on shit, that's some heavy  duty Samsonite shit.
JERRY	m	Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always  nuts.
BILL	m	Hot has got nothing to do with it.
BILL	m	Hold on, I've heard this before...  but I can't remember the end.
JERRY	m	So, the guy goes to Hell and the  devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy  say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great  cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest  Cuban cigars you ever had."
BILL	m	Shit, we really need to find some  gas.
JERRY	m	Then the devil asks, "do you drink?"  Guy says, "yeah"... devil say,  "wonderful, Wednesday is free drinks  night, best booze you ever had...  all made from the finest stuff."
BILL	m	Yeah.
JERRY	m	Then the devil says, "are you gay?"  Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says,  "Well then, I guess you're gonna  hate Thursdays."
BILL	m	Oh yeah, I remember now.
JERRY	m	Yeah, no shit I just told ya. Hey, you think this place called  Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is  still around? It says, "Where the  Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
BILL	m	I dunno... we'll ask around as we  get closer. Man, I really don't want  to run out of gas out here in the  middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
JERRY	m	Don't panic yourself, way too much  caffeine guy... I see a sign. Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen  and Monsters... cool. Also... fried  chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
BILL	m	Perfect.
JERRY	m	I hope this place is cool. We could  use something interesting to liven  up chapter 12.
BILL	m	I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see  if it's worth thinking about.
JERRY	m	OK, Boss.
JERRY	m	Holy crap. You gotta see this place.  It's awesome.
BILL	m	How awesome?
JERRY	m	Really fucking awesome.
BILL	m	Wake up the chicks and bust out the  camera awesome?
JERRY	m	Hell yeah.
JERRY	m	Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.
JERRY	m	Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a  kick ass place.
DENISE	f	Huh?
JERRY	m	Grab Mary and come inside.
DENISE	f	Come on sleeping beauty, time to go  to work.
MARY	f	Sleeping.
DENISE	f	Rise and shine.
MARY	f	No please, let me sit this one out.
DENISE	f	Let's go. You're the one who wanted  to be a photographer.
MARY	f	I resign.
DENISE	f	Too late. You're in for life, let's  move it out Private Shutterbug.
MARY	f	Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy  folk art. It's so quaint... it's so  primal... it's so crap.
DENISE	f	Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute. ...and really who are we to judge  the artistic merit of the tin-can  Mona Lisa?
MARY	f	Aw, shit... I gotta pee anyway.
LEWIS	m	I ain't no rich man, but I see the  truth. You do not have to go to Hell.  You are in Hell. This is Hell. All  American Hell. ...true heaven in my hands... I'm  gonna blow Satan back through the  door to Hell.
BILL	m	How long have you been running this  place?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	How long is a piece of string? Too  God damn long, that's how long.
BILL	m	No, really.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Shit, I don't remember exactly. I  took over for my Pa just after the  Duke nabbed the Oscar.
BILL	m	The Duke?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head  after that.
BILL	m	You mean John Wayne?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Hell, boy there some other Duke you  know about? A great American.
BILL	m	Yeah, I was never that big of a  western fan. I like science fiction.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	I figured that much. Why the fuck  you asking so many jackass questions  for?
BILL	m	You see me and my friends are writing  a book on offbeat roadside  attractions. You know all the crazy  shit you see when you drive cross  country.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	I don't drive cross country.
BILL	m	But if you did.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	I don't.
BILL	m	But suppose for a second you did.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Y'all find us country people real  funny like don't ya... well, God  damn pack up the mule and sling me  some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some  schooling.
BILL	m	No, no I think it's really  interesting.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Well fuck me Side Sally, who want to  read about all that horse shit anyway.
JERRY	m	You'd be surprised. Would it be OK  if we took some pictures and included  this place in our book?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Hey, knock yourself silly.
JERRY	m	You got some really rare stuff here... ...dig your Feegee mermaid.
DENISE	f	I swear I've aged five years since  this trip started.
MARY	f	Tell me about it.
DENISE	f	God, I hate falling asleep in the  afternoon. Now I'll be up all night... ...ugh, my back is killing me.
MARY	f	Yeah, hey how far do you think we  are from your Dad's?
DENISE	f	I don't know. Couple hours I think.  I've got to call him.
MARY	f	It will be nice to have a few days  off to regenerate. This trip is fun,  but it's starting to get brutal.
DENISE	f	Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at  that old stripper lady's place.  Watching her dance around with those  ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
MARY	f	I know, that was some crazy shit. I  never in a million years would have  believed it if I hadn't seen it.
DENISE	f	A decent meal every once in a while  wouldn't hurt either, this road food  is crap.
MARY	f	If I never eat at another Waffle  House again, I can die a happy girl.
DENISE	f	Scattered, smothered and covered.
MARY	f	Exactly... well, I guess a couple  more photos won't kill me.
JERRY	m	Great, you're back. Let's go. We  already paid for the tickets.
DENISE	f	Tickets for what?
JERRY	m	This isn't everything. Get ready for  this... there's a Museum of Murder  and Mayhem.
DENISE	f	I don't want to see that.
MARY	f	How about if we skip it and just  hang out here. I can get some great  shots of this stuff.
JERRY	m	Aw, come on. It will be fun.
DENISE	f	Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds  fun.
BILL	m	We'll need pictures of the inside  too.
MARY	f	Alright, alright. I know... I wanted  to be the photographer.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Anytime this year, people. Alright  line your asses up in front of the  black door. The tour is about to  begin.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Ladies and gentlemen, you are about  to enter a world of darkness. A world  where life and death are meaningless  and pain is God. To your left you see the infamous  Albert Fish.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Sadist, masochist, child killer and  most of all importantly cannibal.  Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning  himself with hot pokers, spankings  with nail-studded paddles and  embedding needles in his groin. On  the right, notice the X-ray...
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	...showing clearly 29 sewing needles  inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish  was executed in 1936 at the age of
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	To your right. One of our most popular  crazies, the psycho of Plainfield,  Ed Gein.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Murderer, cannibal and momma's little  bitch boy. Mr. Gein found special  pleasure in playing with the dead  bodies of women, especially their  sexual organs. He was quite a handy  little dandy, fashioning lamp shades,  jewelry and human skin suits from  his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered  when the decapitated body of Bernice  Worden was found gutted like a deer,  hanging in his barn.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	And now I would like to introduce a  local hero, S. Quentin Quale, a.k.a.  The Butcher Boy, a.k.a. Nurse Nellie  and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Murderer, torturer and most of all  master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern  at Willows State Mental Hospital,  nicknamed Weeping Willows for its  neverending cries of pain, took great  pleasure in control. Through primitive  brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed he  could create a race of superhumans  from the mentally ill, or so the  story goes. His terrifying experiments  continued until 1952.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	At which time he was discovered and  turned over to authorities for  observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale  was abducted from his cell by members  of the victims' families. Vigilante  justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was  taken out and hanged. The next day  his body was found to be missing.  Some say he survived, rescued by his  loyal slaves, others say they hung  the wrong man... To this day no sign  of Dr. Satan has ever been discovered.  But who knows? Maybe he lives next  door to you.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Please exit through the door.
MR. WILLIS	m	Hello... ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong,  did you break down?
DENISE	f	No, nothing like that... yeah, we're  gonna be a little late. We stopped  for gas at this place called Capt.  Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville  and it turned into a whole thing, so  we're kind of behind schedule.
MR. WILLIS	m	Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that  place before. I seem to remember a  crabby old bastard in a crummy clown  suit running the place.
DENISE	f	Yeah, well he's still here. I think  him and Jerry are fast becoming  buddies, you know Jerry... yeah,  he's gotta see everything... yeah, I  know... thinks there's some unsolved  mystery around every corner.
MR. WILLIS	m	Well, don't take too long, the kids  are already knocking down the door  demanding their sugar fix... I know,  I know I forgot to mention that  Halloween falls on a school night,  so they're trick or treating  tonight... I got the joint decked  out this year, built a graveyard in  the front yard like when you were a  kid.
DENISE	f	Hopefully I can move things along  here and make up the lost time by  speeding all the way home... yes,  Dad I'm kidding.
MR. WILLIS	m	Well, just promise me you'll be  careful... alright, alright see ya  soon... good-bye.
JERRY	m	I'm gonna go ask him.
MARY	f	Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all  we're gonna get out of this place  and its starting to rain.
JERRY	m	Shit, it is only sprinkling and it's  worth the trouble. Hold on for two  seconds.
DENISE	f	Yeah so... OK, expect us more around  eleven or so. OK yeah, I will...  love you, too, bye.
JERRY	m	I know it's hard to understand, but  I really want to see this tree.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	OK, alright I'll draw you a map, but  I still say it is a waste of time.
JERRY	m	Great.
MARY	f	Geez, he never gets tired does he.
DENISE	f	Never. I swear to God he never sleeps,  he goes to bed after me, wakes up  before me. He's always working on
MARY	f	Maybe he's a cyborg.
BILL	m	I like sleep.
DENISE	f	Here he comes.
JERRY	m	We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good  buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.
MARY	f	Huh?
DENISE	f	Ugh, what's that smell?
JERRY	m	Fried chicken. Anybody want some?
OLD MAN	m	I don't know where that skunk ape  sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all...  all I know is he eats squirrels to  survive and he had impure relations  with my wife.
WIFE	f	That's true. He performed lurid acts  upon me and my person while my husband  Russell was a fix'n to our hound  Clarence.
OLD MAN	m	If I see that thing again... I'm a  gonna kill that skunk ape.
BILL	m	What does it look like?
WIFE	f	It looked just like that chubby fella  from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine.
OLD MAN	m	Hold up the picture.
JERRY	m	Keep straight on this road here.
BILL	m	How much further?
JERRY	m	I'm not exactly sure... it looks  close. Did we pass an abandoned school  bus yet?
BILL	m	I don't know.
MARY	f	Let's just skip it. It is probably  nothing anyway.
DENISE	f	Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see  anything now, it's too dark. Let's  forget it.
JERRY	m	Come on, we need something like this.  It could be the real deal. It's too  far out of the way to come back to.
BILL	m	What's that?
JERRY	m	It's a hitchhiker.
BILL	m	Way out here?
MARY	f	Well, don't even think about playing  the good samaritan, there's way too  many psychos wandering loose these  days.
BILL	m	It's a girl.
JERRY	m	Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
DENISE	f	That seems likely.
MARY	f	Should we stop?
BILL	m	We can't leave her out here in the  rain... maybe we can just drop her  at the next rest area.
MARY	f	She looks like a freak.
DENISE	f	Stick her in the front, if you want  to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.
MARY	f	She looks like she stinks.
BILL	m	She looks like she stinks.
JERRY	m	Cat fight, cat fight.
DENISE	f	Hardy har, har.
BABY	f	Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been  standing out there in that toad  strangling rain for like a hundred  million years.
JERRY	m	Really, that's a long time.
BABY	f	Yeah, most people just whiz on by  like I was invisible or something...  or else they're creeps who wanna jam  their slimy hands down my pants and  twiddle my naughty-naughty.
JERRY	m	Yikes.
BABY	f	Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I  look in and he's got his thing out  waving it around like a drunk monkey.
DENISE	f	Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest  way for a girl to travel.
BABY	f	Yeah, but it's fun.
MARY	f	Sounds like a magical trip through  the heartland.
BILL	m	Where ya headed?
BABY	f	Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's  house... yeah, I was out doing this  thing.
BILL	m	Where's that?
BABY	f	Couple more miles up this road.
JERRY	m	Hey, you might know... ...you know where this tree is at?  It's an old hanging tree from...
BABY	f	Yeah, I know where that is, it's  right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's  tree. I can show ya.
JERRY	m	Really, wow, so it's really a real  thing.
BABY	f	Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play  there all the time. But, you can't  find it without me. Outsider can't  find no deadwood.
JERRY	m	Deadwood, is that what it's called?  Cool, will you show us?
BABY	f	Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know  what word I hate?
JERRY	m	What?
BABY	f	Cone.
JERRY	m	Huh... what cone?
BABY	f	Any cone, yeah... I hate that word... sounds ugly, I  don't like crumple either.
JERRY	m	I always hate saying the word cheese,  every time you get your picture  taken... smile, say cheese.
BABY	f	I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes  make me nervous.
BILL	m	What about the tree?
BABY	f	Oh yeah, the tree.
MARY	f	This is crazy. She don't know nothing.
BABY	f	Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's  at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute  all bundled up like a cinnamon roll  of Christmas love.
JERRY	m	Cool.
BILL	m	Which way?
BABY	f	Go straight up about another mile...  til we hit Cherrypicker Road and  turn right... it ain't far from there.
NEWS REPORTER	m	This is WJRC News at the top of the  hour... Investigators in Clairemont  County are no closer to identifying  the body of a young woman found  crucified to the doors of St. Mary's  Church yesterday morning.
MARY	f	Excuse me, could you not smoke in  here?
NEWS REPORTER	m	Local police and State Officials  have released this report...
JERRY	m	What's that?
BILL	m	I don't know. Looks like some kind  of animal.
MARY	f	Why are we stopping?
BILL	m	There's a dog in the road.
DENISE	f	Honk at him. Scare him.
BILL	m	He won't move.
MARY	f	Go around him.
BILL	m	There's not enough room.
MARY	f	Then run him over, he'll move.
BABY	f	No! He's one of God's creatures, he  can't help it if he's dumb... I'm  just crazy about animals.
MARY	f	The animals have got nothing to do  with it.
BILL	m	Hey, he moved.
MARY	f	Let's get going before that thing  tries to eat the car or something.
JERRY	m	That reminds me of a film I saw once  of a guy who got out of his car at  Lion Country Safari to take a picture  of a lion cub and got eaten by the  lions.
BILL	m	Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always  thought it was bullshit.
JERRY	m	No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces  while his family watched from the  car. The wife is screaming, the kids  are crying. Some dude in another car  filmed the whole thing.
BABY	f	I'd like to see that.
MARY	f	Nice.
JERRY	m	The lions were totally covered in  this guy's blood... I think they ate  his face off, tore open his rib cage,  pulled his legs off... it was a wild  scene.
BABY	f	Things like that get a lot bloodier  than ya think.
JERRY	m	What was that?
BILL	m	Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
MARY	f	Don't even say it.
DENISE	f	You got to be fucking joking.
MARY	f	God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt  was fucking bullshit.
BILL	m	OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe  I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out  just yet.
JERRY	m	I'll help ya.
BILL	m	Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too  much trouble.
BILL	m	I hope you fixed the spare like I  asked ya.
JERRY	m	Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't...  um, I can't remember. I think I took  it out to fit the bags and forgot to  put it back.
BILL	m	Jesus Christ, Jerry.
JERRY	m	Well, technically I did what ya said.
BILL	m	You're a real fucking piece of work.
MARY	f	Can I help you with something?
BABY	f	I was just wondering.
MARY	f	Wondering what?
BABY	f	Are you two gals all funny with each  other?
MARY	f	What?
BABY	f	You know... a couple of queers.
MARY	f	Do you believe this fucking girl?
BABY	f	I was just wondering, cause you got  a pissy look about you... like a  real pussy licking bitch.
DENISE	f	No. No pussy licking here, but thanks  for your concern.
BILL	m	Well, I got some bad news and some  bad news.
MARY	f	What?
JERRY	m	Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man.  There's no saving it now.
BILL	m	And the spare is safely sitting in  Jerry's garage.
DENISE	f	For fucking sake Jerry, what the  fuck are we gonna do?
MARY	f	What the hell are you laughing about?
BABY	f	I just pictured the tire sitting in  a chair watching TV.
MARY	f	Oh, wonderful. Fucking psycho.
BILL	m	I guess I'll try to back it out on  the rim... at least to the main road.
BABY	f	If you keep going straight you can  get back on the interstate... it's  easier.
MARY	f	Just back up.
JERRY	m	I think we should go straight. I  mean we know for a fact there ain't  nothing back that way, right?
BABY	f	Oh wait! I love this song!
BILL	m	Fine. I'll go straight.
MARY	f	What!
BILL	m	Fine! I'll go straight!
BILL	m	Fuck! We are fucked!
DENISE	f	Turn that fucking radio off!
DENISE	f	Now what are we gonna do?
BABY	f	We can walk to my house from here.  My brother's got a tow truck, he can  come get your car.
MARY	f	I think I'm going fucking crazy.
DENISE	f	I can't believe...
BILL	m	OK, whatever. Let's go get your  brother's truck. Faster we get the  truck, faster we get out of here.
BABY	f	OK.
JERRY	m	I'll go. It's my fault.
MARY	f	You said it, not me.
BILL	m	Forget it. I'll just go.
MARY	f	Screw that, no way, I ain't letting  you go by yourself.
BILL	m	Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just  stay here, no sense everybody getting  drenched.
JERRY	m	I agree.
BABY	f	Yeah, it won't take long and besides  you sassy poodle girls will slow us  down.
BILL	m	Don't worry, I'll be right back.
BABY	f	Come on.
JERRY	m	Don't forget the flashlight, it's  pretty dark out there.
BILL	m	Thanks.
JERRY	m	No problem.
MISS BUNNY	f	Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my  Hollywood Revue... ...where the stars shine forever.
MISS BUNNY	f	Hi, this is the place where the magic  happens.
MISS BUNNY	f	This is Jenny, she is our resident  Ingrid Bergman.

HUMPHREY CAT	m	If that plane leaves the ground and  you're not with him you'll regret  it... maybe not today, maybe not  tomorrow but soon and for the rest  of your life.
INGRID SQUIRREL	f	But what about us?
HUMPHREY CAT	m	We'll always have Paris. We didn't  have, we lost it... until you came  to Casablanca. We got it back last  night.
INGRID SQUIRREL	f	When I said I would never leave you.
HUMPHREY CAT	m	And you never will.
BILL	m	How much further?
BABY	f	Almost there... are you in a hurry  or something?
BILL	m	Well, yeah, kind of.
DENISE	f	Fuck, it's freezing.
JERRY	m	Hey, listen to this... I think this  is related to our Dr. Satan.
DENISE	f	Oh, yeah.
JERRY	m	Yeah, in this book there's a chapter  called Self Made Freaks about how  people would mutilate themselves in  order to work in a freak show. It  mostly talks about tattooed people  and wild men of Borneo and shit like  that, but there is one mention of a  single case where a woman was  suspected of having her arms removed  on purpose to become an arm-less  wonder.
DENISE	f	Yeah, so how does that fit with the  story of four morons with a flat  tire looking for a dead tree?
JERRY	m	It says, "records show that Ellie  Thompson was born in 1914 of normal  physical stature and lived a life of  normal bearings, until such time  that she was placed in the care of  the Willows State Mental Facility."
DENISE	f	So.
JERRY	m	Now she was put in the nuthouse in  1930 at the age of 16.
DENISE	f	Why?
JERRY	m	Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say,  but she was released sometime in  1937, only to reappear as Ellie  Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says  she, "criss-crossed the United States  constantly in carnivals and freak  shows until her death in 1946."
DENISE	f	Yeah?
JERRY	m	These dates perfectly correspond  with the time frame of our beloved  Dr. Satan working at the looney bin.  I'll bet he amputated her arms.
DENISE	f	So what?
JERRY	m	I don't know, I just thought it was  interesting.
DENISE	f	You know what Jerry, who really cares  at this point?
JERRY	m	I don't... ...I just thought it was weird.
MARY	f	God damn it, I must be fucking crazy  to let him go off with that crazy  fucking bitch.
JERRY	m	Huh?
MARY	f	That stupid hillbilly slut.
JERRY	m	Oh, don't blow everything out of  proportion.
MARY	f	You didn't see the look she threw  me. She's up to something.
DENISE	f	Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty  fucked shit to us.
JERRY	m	When?
DENISE	f	When you were outside with Bill.
MARY	f	She said we look like pussy lickers  or some shit like that.
DENISE	f	Yeah, she said we looked queer.
JERRY	m	Aw, get over it, she's just some  dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough  to be up to nothing... I mean  anything... chicks.
BABY	f	These are all my dolls. I use to  like to chop their heads off.
BABY	f	The door's locked. I'll gotta go  around... wait here.
BILL	m	OK.
BILL	m	Christ, you scared the shit out of  me.
BABY	f	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
BILL	m	Is your brother ready to go?
BABY	f	Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll  wait inside, come on.
BILL	m	He left!
BABY	f	Yeah, come on.
MARY	f	How long has it been?
DENISE	f	I don't know... about half an hour.
MARY	f	What was that?
DENISE	f	What? I didn't hear anything.
MARY	f	Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
DENISE	f	Now... listen.
MARY	f	I don't hear anything.
DENISE	f	Shhhhhh, quiet.
MARY	f	I still don't.
DENISE	f	Turn on the headlights. See if  anything is out there.
JERRY	m	What... what!
MARY	f	Lock the doors... quick, quick.
DENISE	f	Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.
JERRY	m	Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm  down! It's the tow truck guy.
MARY	f	What!
DENISE	f	Jesus Christ.
MARY	f	I think I'm gonna have a fucking  heart attack.
JERRY	m	OK lassies, I think it's time you  get to gripping reality.
MARY	f	Enough with the stupid voices.
GLORIA STUART	f	Knock again louder.
MELVYN DOUGLAS	m	I should of thought that was loud  enough to wake the dead... that's an  idea.
RAYMOND MASSEY	m	What is?
MELVYN DOUGLAS	m	Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing  the people inside were dead. All  stretched out with the lights quietly  burning about them.
GLORIA STUART	f	I'm sure it would be very amusing.
BILL	m	So, you live here alone... I mean  with just your brother?
BABY	f	No. There's a bunch a us 'round  somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'.  She sleeps a lot, now... do you want  marshmallows?
BILL	m	Um, yeah sure, I guess.
BABY	f	You sure do a lot of guessing.
BILL	m	Thank you.
BABY	f	You're welcome.
BILL	m	Hey, um... ...what kind of animal is that?
BABY	f	A dead one.
BILL	m	Mmmmm, this is tasty.
BABY	f	Ain't the only thing tasty in this  house.
BILL	m	I wonder what time it is. Seems kind  of late.
BABY	f	Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my  bedtime... are you flirting with me?
BILL	m	What? No, I'm was worried that... I  was just wondering what's taking so  long.
BABY	f	Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and  killed everbody?
BILL	m	That's not something to joke about.
BABY	f	OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin  ate 'em up.
BILL	m	Hey, great they're back.
BABY	f	Whoopie fucking doo.
DR. WOLFENSTEIN	m	Aaaahooooh, the Doctor is in! Don't  move, don't scream. Stay tuned for  more creature craziness from channel  68's Halloween eve movie marathon.  I'm your host... your ghost host  with the most, baby... Dr. Wolfenstein  and will be with you until the end.  Aaaaaaahooooooh!
JERRY	m	Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
DENISE	f	Thanks for coming to get us. Little  brother almost scared us to death.
JERRY	m	Dude, your chick's a little high  strung.
BILL	m	Mary, I'm sorry but he left without  me. Mary... come on, you don't think  I'd leave you stranded out there.
DENISE	f	Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell  him we're gonna be late. Can I use  your phone?
DENISE	f	Excuse me, may I please use your  phone?
MARY	f	Bill, why don't you ask her... she's  your special friend.
MOTHER	f	Ain't got one.
DENISE	f	Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a  phone?
MOTHER	f	No, none. I had one once, back in  '57 maybe... I don't know. Really  ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping  at around here no more.
JERRY	m	Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck  could drive us to a phone.
MOTHER	f	His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we  all call him R.J.
JERRY	m	Oh, right.
MOTHER	f	What do they call you, sweety?
JERRY	m	Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise  and Mary.
BILL	m	Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us  and our car to the nearest garage.
DENISE	f	I mean obviously we will compensate  you for your troubles.
MOTHER	f	Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no,  no fuss. Baby... go see what Rufus Jr. is  doing with these nice folks'  automobile.
MOTHER	f	In the meanwhile please make  yourselves at home.
CHILDREN	?	98 bodies in your bed, Some are green,  some are red. Eat the flesh and pick  the bones, Drink the blood when you  get home. 99 bodies in the ground,  Some are blue, some are brown. Gather  'round the people said, Where do you  go when you are dead?
MOTHER	f	So, what brings you kids way out  here, ain't you got something better  to do for Halloween than wander around  out here in the sticks?
JERRY	m	Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a  hoedown.
MOTHER	f	Oh, really... ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if  you know what I mean... I bet I got  a few moves you ain't never seen.
JERRY	m	I don't doubt that.
DENISE	f	No, he's just joking. We don't really  have any plans other than spending  the night at my Dad's house... ...which is where we were headed  when our car broke down.
MOTHER	f	That's nice.
DENISE	f	Yeah, I guess I'll just help him  hand out candy to the trick or  treaters.
JERRY	m	And I'm gonna help put the razor  blades in the candy apples.
MOTHER	f	I'll bet you are... you are a naughty  little thing aren't ya.
JERRY	m	I was just kidding.
MOTHER	f	Oh, I get it... I guess you think  you're too good for the simple  pleasures of Halloween.
MARY	f	No, just a little too old.
MOTHER	f	Oh really, well I hope something  changes your mind some day.
BABY	f	Tiny's home.
MOTHER	f	What about R.J.?
BABY	f	Oh, he was already gone before I  seen him... but Tiny saw him and  said he said he was going out to the  yard to get a new wheel.
BILL	m	The yard, what's that?
MOTHER	f	It's an old auto junkyard out in  Baldwin.
DENISE	f	How long is that gonna take?
MOTHER	f	He should be back in a couple hours.
MARY	f	A couple hours!
DENISE	f	Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
MOTHER	f	Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even  got a bicycle.
DENISE	f	How's he get around out here?
BABY	f	He walks, duh.
MARY	f	Fucking great.
MOTHER	f	I know you're my guests and welcome  but I'd please advise you to keep  from cussing while in my house, thank  you.
MARY	f	Sorry.
MOTHER	f	Well, even though I know it seems  childish to you all. Tonight is  Halloween eve and it special to us  so you are all invited to stay for  dinner.
DENISE	f	Thank you.
JERRY	m	Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
MOTHER	f	You're a strange one, aren't ya honey.  I think you and me are get on like... ...like something real good.
DR. WOLFENSTEIN	m	There well, who knew there was love  to be found in The Old Dark House.  Coming up next, do not move a muscle,  an artery or a vein as we venture  into another creepy classic... are  you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?
MARY	f	I hope to Christ she doesn't expect  us to wear these things.
BILL	m	Whatever it is just do it. The more  we play along the faster we'll get  the hell out of here.
DENISE	f	Really, now is not the time to make  waves.
JERRY	m	Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt  to show up.
DENISE	f	Shhhhhh.
DENISE	f	You sure you don't need any help in  there?
MOTHER	f	No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of  host would I be if I put my guests  to this kind of work.
BABY	f	Ma, Tiny's in.
MOTHER	f	Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
BABY	f	Ma, I can't, I'm busy getting dressed.
MOTHER	f	You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't  hear so much.
DENISE	f	Oh.
MOTHER	f	Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's  fault. I mean Earl was a good man...  I mean he never hit me or nothing,  but one day he just got up and went  pure devil on us all.
DENISE	f	What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's  none of my business.
MOTHER	f	He tried to burn the house down,  said it was possessed by the spirits.  Tiny was sleeping in the basement  where the fire started. I don't think  Earl ever meant to harm us... but  Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were  destroyed and most of his skin.
BILL	m	Is that why he wears the mask?
MOTHER	f	Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around  new people, but he'll warm up to  ya... especially the ladies.
JERRY	m	Great. I thought I felt a certain  attraction between Mary and Tiny  soon as he walked in.
MOTHER	f	Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
JERRY	m	Didn't ya think, Mary?
MOTHER	f	Well, we'll see... the night is young  and so are you... oh well, couple  more minutes.
DENISE	f	Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
MARY	f	Yeah, it's really your fault that  we're stuck in this shithole in the  first place.
JERRY	m	Oh, don't worry she didn't get  offended by what I said. You two got  to lighten up... right, Bill?
BILL	m	Whatever, at this point all I care  about is food. I'm starving and I  got a fucking killer headache.
JERRY	m	Hey, I asked you if you wanted some  chicken.
BILL	m	Didn't look like chicken to me, more  like fried pussy cat.
JERRY	m	Tasted pretty good.
GRAMPA	m	God damn it, I can do it. I can do  it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't  dead yet... so don't you and your  sister start counting out my money  yet.
GRAMPA	m	God damn, my dogs are barking.
BELA LUGOSI	f	Your hands, please. Your left hand  shows your past...
BELA LUGOSI	f	...and your right hand shows your  future.
MR. WILLIS	m	Hello, Denise?
MR. WILLIS	m	Oh, yeah... no, Fred. I was hoping  you were Denise, she's a little late. Yeah, yeah I'm sure the rain just  slowed 'em down... yeah... uh-huh,  yeah... no, no you can keep it 'til  Tuesday... alright, talk to ya  tomorrow, bye.
MOTHER	f	OK, everyone, put on your masks. We  can't very well eat with our everyday  faces exposed.
GRAMPA	m	Christ kid, put it on. She ain't  letting any of us touch the grub  'til you're wearing the damn thing.
JERRY	m	I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs...  Ummmm.
MOTHER	f	Firefly.
JERRY	m	Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs.  Firefly, do you know anything about  the legend of Dr. Satan?
BILL	m	Here we go.
MOTHER	f	Well, I'm not much for local gossip  an this and that, but I've heard it  mentioned in passing over the years  but... I mean folks is queer and  they say things, crazy things you  know what I mean?
GRAMPA	m	It's all talk, yakty yak, like a  bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ,  Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's  nuts alright... ...hey, I hear some genius up north  got a hot line on the Easter Bunny  for ya.
OTIS	m	I know all about what you want to  know about.
MOTHER	f	Otis! I can't believe you decided to  come down and join us... and you  brought little Wolf. This really is  a special night... all my babies  together.
OTIS	m	Now, I don't know where you heard  all your little fairy fables about  Dr. Satan but...
BILL	m	From a Captain Spaulding down at  some museum.
OTIS	m	That old bitch hog don't know shit.  He tells cute little tattle-tales to  sell his junk, but he don't sell no  Yankee boys no truth.
JERRY	m	But something happened, right? I  mean the story is based on a real  incident, right?
GRAMPA	m	What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter  for the Daily Asshole?
MOTHER	f	Grampa... watch the language.
OTIS	m	I ain't sure that you really need to  know. It's better you go home still  dreaming about your kitty cats and  puppy dogs.
JERRY	m	I really want to know.
GRAMPA	m	Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten  him.
OTIS	m	Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in  the fire if I told ya you'd see  Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to  realize you got a demon sticking out  your ass singing, "Holy Miss Moly, I  got a live one."
DENISE	f	Can we please change the subject?
GRAMPA	m	Dinner's over. Ladies and Germs... it's showtime.
BILL	m	What's he so excited about?
DENISE	f	Yeah, showtime for what?
MOTHER	f	For the show. It's Halloween eve and  time for our show.
JERRY	m	Oh, you mean on TV.
MOTHER	f	No, no, no it's so much more special  than that... you'll see, you'll be  the first to ever see. I think this  is something you'll really love.
JERRY	m	Great.
MOTHER	f	Please, come in... how many in your  party... ...one, two, three and four... right  this way.
MOTHER	f	Please be seated.
JERRY	m	This is way too fucked up for words.
MARY	f	I know the words... fucking psycho  fucking bullshit, that's the words.
BILL	m	Just grin and bear it.
DENISE	f	That food... ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
MARY	f	Check this out.
BILL	m	Well, ya can't complain I never take  you anyplace.
BILL	m	I can't believe what I'm seeing.
JERRY	m	I know, this is fucking nuts.
MARY	f	This is starting to make me real  uncomfortable.
BILL	m	Just sit back and enjoy the show.
GRAMPA	m	Ladies and gentlemen, straight from  his smash six week sold out run at  Tiki-Ti Club... the Stardust lounge  is proud to present Mr. Sexy  himself... Grampa Hugo.
GRAMPA	m	Hey, let me tell ya a story... so  I'm hanging out with my buddy Hal  Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal  let's go get some booze and chase  the chickens... fucking Hal says no,  no the old battle axe at home will  break my balls... I gotta get my ass  home.
GRAMPA	m	So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the  secret. Go home tonight, crawl into  bed, get under the covers and eat  your wife's pussy... I mean jam your  face right in the bush.
DENISE	f	What are you laughing at?
JERRY	m	I don't know, I think he's funny.
DENISE	f	This isn't funny, it's twisted.
GRAMPA	m	So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts  chomping and licking away at her  pussy, she's screaming and howling...  totally passes out from the  experience.
MARY	f	Dear God, let this end.
GRAMPA	m	Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good,  so he goes into the bathroom for a  quick shave... ...suddenly he lets out a horrible  scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
GRAMPA	m	Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's  wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet  down, you'll wake Grandma!"
GRAMPA	m	Thank you, you're too kind, too  kind... stay in your seats, coming  up next we got something special for  you men out there.
DENISE	f	Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but  this is ridiculous.
BILL	m	Man, it's already ten thirty.
MARY	f	I'm with Denise, can't we just walk  to someplace, this is getting fucking  stupid.
JERRY	m	Negative. Shit, we are so deep in  the sticks we could walk for hours  and find zero.
BILL	m	Yeah, I'd say at this point all we  can do is just wait it out. There's  nothing else.
DENISE	f	I suppose. I mean they're obviously  all bonkers, but I guess they're  harmless.
MARY	f	I fucking hope so.
DENISE	f	You gotta be kidding me. This chick  is wasted.
JERRY	m	Shhhhhh.
MARY	f	How much is a person supposed to  stand?
BILL	m	Quiet.
MARY	f	Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I  disturbing your viewing pleasure?
MARY	f	Take that, you fucking slut! Fucking redneck whore!
BABY	f	You shouldn't a done that.
MARY	f	Why? You gonna do something about  it?
BABY	f	Yeah, I'll do something.
BABY	f	I'll cut your fucking tits off and  shove 'em down your throat.
MOTHER	f	Baby! Stop!
BABY	f	Come on, ma... this bitch's got it  coming.
MOTHER	f	No, I told you...
RUFUS JR.	m	Car's done.
DENISE	f	Thank God.
MOTHER	f	I suggest you kids leave now.
MARY	f	Don't worry, I'm gone.
BILL	m	Don't look back, just get in the  car.
DENISE	f	Lock the fucking doors.
BILL	m	Almost there.
JERRY	m	Jesus, you think she was really gonna  cut you?
MARY	f	Of course she was gonna cut me, she's  a fucking nut... I knew she was crazy from the second  we picked her up.
BABY	f	You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna  die like a dog!
MARY	f	Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!
MARY	f	What are you doing!
BILL	m	I gotta open the gate.
MARY	f	Drive through it!
BILL	m	It won't work.
JERRY	m	Holy fuck, hurry up.
MARY	f	Bill! Help him!
MR. WILLIS	m	Hi. Lieutenant Broekman please...  Donald Willis.
MR. WILLIS	m	Hey, Phil... Yeah, I'm alright... but I need you  to check on something for me.
MR. WILLIS	m	I'm a little worried about Denise.  She called me last night from the  road, out by Ruggsville at some joint  called Spaulding's or something like  that, said she'd be here about  eleven... but she never showed up.
MR. WILLIS	m	Yeah, if you could run a check on up  that way and see about any accidents  or road closing or anything, I'd  really appreciate it... ...yeah, yeah, I know... I'm sure  nothing happened but, you know me I  like to worry... thanks... bye.
OTIS	m	Shut your fucking mouth!
OTIS	m	I said shut your mouth!
OTIS	m	Listen, you Malibu Barbie middle  class piece of shit. I'm trying to  work, you got me, work... you ever  work?
OTIS	m	Yeah, I'll bet you did. Scooping ice  cream to your shitheel friends on  summer break... well, I ain't talking  about white socks with Mickey Mouse  on one side and Donald Duck on the  other... shit, you ain't reading no  funny books, mamma.
OTIS	m	This is blood and guts, Suzy Q. Our  bodies come and go, but this blood  is forever... ...let me read you something, listen  and learn... you listening?
OTIS	m	And the angels, all pallid and wan,  Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the  play is the tragedy "Man" And its  hero the Conqueror Worm... ...you get that? Art is eternal, you  get me, mamma?
OTIS	m	Now, I'm gonna remove my hand... you  make a sound and I swear I'll slit  you open and make you eat your own  fucking intestines... you get me?
MARY	f	Why? Why are you doing this?
OTIS	m	Doing what? Messy up your day? Well,  fuck lady there are some bigger issues  at hand... than your fucking have a  nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
MARY	f	Where's Bill?
OTIS	m	Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's  been great help to me... a real  blessing... I couldn't have asked  for a better specimen. I mean you  don't know what a dry spell I've  had, total block... ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
MARY	f	Where is he?
OTIS	m	Let's go see.
MARY	f	Bill? No, no, no! What have you done?  Bill!
OTIS	m	Behold... The Fish-Boy!
MARY	f	This can't be real, this can't be  real, this can't be real.
OTIS	m	Oh, it's real... as real as I want  it to be, mamma... ...look, see the magic in my brush  strokes.
MARY	f	Fuck you, you fucking freak!
OTIS	m	Oh, come now... we're all creatures  of God and freaks in our own way... ...but if you'll notice... right here, needs a little something,  heh?
MARY	f	What are you doing? ...no, stop... please, please.
OTIS	m	You, my dear worm feeder, are about  to become immortalized.
MARY	f	Noooooooooooo!
WYDELL	f	Well, let's go see if the nut that  runs this place can help us.
NAISH	m	Right.
NAISH	m	Get a load of all this crap... this  is one sick place.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Whoever's a jerking off on that bell  better be gone when I get out there...  'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Officers, officers what can I do for  you today? I ain't fried up the birds  yet... if that's what you're ring a  ding dinging about.
WYDELL	f	What I need are some answers.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Well, I'll try but I don't know  nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who  likes to mind his own business, if  ya get what I'm saying.
WYDELL	f	You seen this girl? Say... within  the last 24 hours.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Yeah, yeah I seen her. Good looking  kid, but not really my type... ...I like meaty, eh?
NAISH	m	Hey ass clown, how 'bout some answers.  He ain't interested in your love  life.
WYDELL	f	Come on, get with the facts.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Hmmmmmmmmm?
WYDELL	f	What'd you see, who was she with,  where were they going?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Aw, she was with some nosey, smartass  high-rise kids. They were poking  around... asking stupid questions.
NAISH	m	Questions about what?
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	This and that, mostly some tired Dr.  Satan bullshit... they got a gander  at the display back there and thought  they could solve the great Deadwoods  mystery.
WYDELL	f	And...
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	And I gave 'em directions out there,  up by the old farm row... I figured  what's the harm. Stupid kids probably  going out to piss up a rope and got  themselves turned around backasswards  and got lost as shit.
WYDELL	f	Is that all... think real hard.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Yeah, they weren't here but a few  minutes, didn't really have time to  get as up close and personal as I do  with most of the assholes that wander  through here.
WYDELL	f	How's about you give me those same  directions.
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to  get all True Grit all over my ass...  I'll give'm to ya... you can knock  yourself silly for all I care.
WYDELL	f	Enough talk, write.
BABY	f	We're gonna have fun tonight, bro.
RUFUS JR.	m	Yeah, fun.
NAISH	m	Boss, the way I see it is these kids  probally stop off somewhere, bought  a bunch of booze and are off getting  shitfaced.
WYDELL	f	I hope you're right, but my guts are  telling me different.
NAISH	m	Your Spidey senses tingling.
WYDELL	f	Yeah... ...huh, what the hell are you talking  about?
NAISH	m	You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey  senses... like Spider-man... ...you know, like in the comics.
WYDELL	f	How old do you think I am? I know  who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to  your point.
NAISH	m	You know, his senses start tingling...  when he was approaching danger and  shit.
WYDELL	f	I always favored the Hulk.
NAISH	m	Hulk was dumb as shit.
WYDELL	f	Aw, fuck.
NAISH	m	What.
NAISH	m	Plates match.
WYDELL	f	Call the chief... We found 'em.
CASHIER	m	You all having a Halloween party  tonight?
BABY	f	Now, what makes you think that?
CASHIER	m	You all sure are buying a lot of  holy water for two people.
BABY	f	Yeah, well we like to get fucked up  and do fucked up shit, you know what  I mean?
CASHIER	m	Yeah, yeah... ...I like to fuck shit up.
BABY	f	I'll bet you do... how much we owe  ya... ...Goober?
CASHIER	m	Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober,  but the guys drew in the other O,  fucking assholes.
BABY	f	Great story Goober, how much?
CASHIER	m	Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five  dollars.
BABY	f	Keep the change and get yourself a  new name.
CASHIER	m	Holy crap, thanks!
BABY	f	Come on, bro. Let's go.
CASHIER	m	Hey, wait take this.
BABY	f	What's this?
CASHIER	m	A missing girl. I use'ta go to school  with her, she just up and disappeared  some day... real weird.
BABY	f	Now isn't she a happy little cherub...  oh well ...nobody just up and disappears.
RUFUS JR.	m	Aliens.
BABY	f	Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens.
HUSTON	m	What'd we here, Georgie?
WYDELL	f	A vehicle registered to a William S.  Hudley.
HUSTON	m	Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves  a field day beating the shit outta  this thing.
WYDELL	f	Yeah, no mercy here.
HUSTON	m	Recover any bodies?
WYDELL	f	Not yet.
HUSTON	m	Shit, I wonder what these kids did  to bring this much hell down on 'em.
WYDELL	f	Just in the wrong place at the wrong  time.
HUSTON	m	That's the understatement of the  year.
WYDELL	f	Yep, I suppose it is.
NAISH	m	Hey, I found something.
HUSTON	m	What'd ya got there?
NAISH	m	Keys.
HUSTON	m	Well Christ boy, don't stand there  like a prize dog dick with his  butthole caught up a tree.
NAISH	m	Huh?
HUSTON	m	Open up the trunk.
NAISH	m	Yes, sir.
WYDELL	f	Toss 'em over here.
WYDELL	f	God damn.
HUSTON	m	You find something, Georgie?
WYDELL	f	Yep, I found something.
DENISE	f	Please... Tiny, please. Let me go...  help me.
DENISE	f	Please, God please.
NAISH	m	You sure this guy's supposed to ride  with us? Seems kind of weird.
WYDELL	f	Chief said pick him up and take him  with us on our house to house. Guy's  an ex-cop, thinks he can help.
NAISH	m	Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally  just get in the way.
WYDELL	f	Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit  on the sidelines and wait when your  own kid's missing... besides, ain't  no such thing as an ex-cop.
NAISH	m	I guess not.
WYDELL	f	That must be him.
WYDELL	f	Mr. Willis?
MR. WILLIS	m	Yes, sir.
WYDELL	f	I'm Wydell... this is Naish.
NAISH	m	Hey.
MR. WILLIS	m	George Willis... ...any leads?
WYDELL	f	Well, we were on our way out to run  a check on a couple farmhouses out  on the edge of town... closest thing  we got to a lead at this point.
MR. WILLIS	m	That's it?
WYDELL	f	Well, all we know is the kids were  headed out to a spot the locals call  Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with  some local legend about this character  everybody calls Dr. Satan.
MR. WILLIS	m	Dr. Satan?
NAISH	m	Yeah it's horseshit, just some  boogieman crap that the kids like to  scare each other with.
WYDELL	f	Anyway, there's not much else out  that way... so, I figure maybe there's  a chance the kids broke down and  found their way over to one of the  farms.
MR. WILLIS	m	What about the body you found?
WYDELL	f	Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm,  that's a strange one.
NAISH	m	Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing  for a couple months, figured for a  runaway.
MR. WILLIS	m	Fit the profile?
NAISH	m	No, not really. Good kid, never been  in any trouble.
WYDELL	f	Her part in this I can't figure...  but I will.
MR. WILLIS	m	Christ, you know it's crazy... I lived through so many other people's  nightmares, you know. Always cool  and calm, but... but I never thought  I'd be the one needing help, ya know?
NAISH	m	Don't worry, we'll find her.
WYDELL	f	Let's hit the road, sooner we get a  move on sooner we'll find her.
GRAMPA	m	God damn bitch, what the fuck are  you waiting for... Charles Nelson  Reilly don't know shit...
OTIS	m	Watch that bitch, she's thinking  about that Klugman bangin' Brett  Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard  Dawson.
OTIS	m	He's the fucking slick jack Match  Game man, mamma.
GRAMPA	m	Where do they find these people?
MR. WILLIS	m	Christ, four kids couldn't just  disappear.
NAISH	m	No they couldn't, somebody had to  see something.
MR. WILLIS	m	My Denise is a smart girl, she  wouldn't do anything stupid, and her  boyfriend, he always seemed like a  good kid.
WYDELL	f	I'm sure there's a logical  explanation.
MR. WILLIS	m	I pray to God there is.
NAISH	m	Turn up this road.
MR. WILLIS	m	Where we headed?
WYDELL	f	I seem to remember another farm set  way back off the road where the car  was found. I'm not sure if anyone  lives there anymore, but it's worth  a look.
WYDELL	f	I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You  and Mr. Willis take a look around  the grounds for any sign of anything.
NAISH	m	Right... ...come on.
MOTHER	f	Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops  outside.
OTIS	m	What! God damn, how many?
GRAMPA	m	What? How many?
OTIS	m	Don't worry about it.
MOTHER	f	I don't know. I only saw one.
OTIS	m	I'm sure there's more than that...  fucking pigs always travel in packs... ...here, take this.
MOTHER	f	What should I do?
OTIS	m	Go down stairs and play nice... I'm  a gonna go 'round back and handle  things like I always fucking do.
NAISH	m	Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies  throw anything away?
MR. WILLIS	m	Shhhh... you hear that?
NAISH	m	Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming  from?
MR. WILLIS	m	Over here, inside the smokehouse.
NAISH	m	Anybody in there?
MR. WILLIS	m	We gotta break it open.
NAISH	m	I ain't got a warrant.
MR. WILLIS	m	Tell it to my daughter.
NAISH	m	Shit... fuck procedure.
MOTHER	f	Well hello, officer.
WYDELL	f	Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing  you this fine afternoon.
MOTHER	f	Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it  kind of looks like rain, don't ya  think?
WYDELL	f	My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to  ask you a few questions.
MOTHER	f	Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you  anything you want to know.
WYDELL	f	I appreciate your cooperation. I'm  looking for a missing girl... ...this girl here, Denise Willis...  have you seen her?
MOTHER	f	Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen  her, sorry.
WYDELL	f	Please, could I please come in and  talk to you for a minute? Maybe you  could take a better look at the  picture... might stir up something.
MOTHER	f	I um... no, I don't think so...
WYDELL	f	Please, just a minute.
MOTHER	f	Oh, alright... I guess I can trust  you... being a man of the law and  all.
WYDELL	f	Thank you.
MOTHER	f	Oh, you are very welcome... Lord  knows how I love a man in uniform.
NAISH	m	Jesus Christ.
MR. WILLIS	m	Call Wydell.
WYDELL	f	Think... do any of these kids look  familiar in any way?
MOTHER	f	No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em  before... ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
NAISH	m	Wydell.
WYDELL	f	Excuse me for a second.
WYDELL	f	Over.
NAISH	m	We found one.
NAISH	m	Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over!
NAISH	m	Fuck, go to the car... call for  backup. Tell 'em officer down.
MR. WILLIS	m	Right.
OTIS	m	Hands up, bitch!
OTIS	m	Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie.
OTIS	m	Interlock your fingers behind your  head... ...do it!
OTIS	m	Kneel.
DR. WOLFENSTEIN	m	It is midnight my little boils and  ghouls, the witching hour. Time for  all monsters, murderers, maniacs and  madmen to go to work... so lock your  doors and bolt your windows, sit  back and prepare for a fright night  classic... ...The House of Frankenstein.
GRAMPA	m	Get those motherfucker... those high  water bitches and rocketship  daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em.
RUFUS JR.	m	Show me, show me, show me, show me!
BABY	f	Drink up, it's party time.
MOTHER	f	Enjoy your last night... ...where's Otis?
BABY	f	Oh, he's coming, he got something  real special this year.
RUFUS JR.	m	Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!
MOTHER	f	Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come  down with all this hoop-dee-doo  bouncing off the walls. Now, calm  down.
GRAMPA	m	I shot an elephant in my pajamas  this morning... how he got in my  pajamas I'll never know.
BABY	f	Grampa, shhhhhhhh.
GRAMPA	m	Then we tried to remove the tusks,  but they were embedded in so firmly  that we couldn't budge 'em.
MOTHER	f	Let him finish.
GRAMPA	m	Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,  but that's entirely irrelephant.
OTIS	m	I'm the one who brings the Christmas  candy... now tell me ...Who's your Daddy?
OTIS	m	I'm the one who brings the devil's  brandy...
MOTHER	f	Who's your Daddy!
OTIS	m	Yes! I'm the one who beats you when  you're bad...
BABY	f	Who's your Daddy!
MOTHER	f	Who's your Daddy!
OTIS	m	I'm the one who loves you when you're  fucking dead!
OTIS	m	Now, I say my little darlings... maybe prancing around where you don't  belong ain't such a winner of an  idea...
OTIS	m	And you, the great rusher of fools,  what were you after... Huh, speak to me... Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan...  everybody got to know about Dr. Satan,  Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest  for fuck sake, he's already got one  foot in the grave and the other's  tap dancing around the edge... ...well, I can see the disappointment  on your sad little puppy face... so  I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big  favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna  let you meet the old bastard.
GRAMPA	m	That's a horse's ass alright, I told  you.
OTIS	m	Baby, roll that old love machine  over here, so this boy can meet his  hero.
OTIS	m	You see it's all true, the boogieman  is real and you found him... ...why so sad? Isn't this what you  begged for? There he is, the living  legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan.  Now, don't get shy on me... ask your  hero some questions, don't blow this  last in a lifetime opportunity.
GRAMPA	m	Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the  air, the earth... the universe.
MOTHER	f	Look at the way he lights up... Grampa  just loves meeting his fans.
OTIS	m	Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I  really think you're the coolest...  you're tops on the playground, cooler  than the Fonzie.
BABY	f	Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a  question.
BABY	f	I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do  you like to kiss on the first date  or is that considered slutty?
GRAMPA	m	What the fuck are you saying? Who  the hell is talking to me?
MOTHER	f	Come on, my babies are getting  restless.
RUFUS JR.	m	Dump in the pit, dump in the pit,  dump in the pit.
OTIS	m	Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's  time they get what they came here  for.
OTIS	m	Hold this. Point it over here.
OTIS	m	Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.
BABY	f	Take his gag out, it's more fun with  the screaming.
MOTHER	f	Yeah, I like the screaming too...  it's so much more exciting.
JERRY	m	Please don't kill us, please don't  kill us.
BABY	f	Please don't kill us, please don't  kill us.
OTIS	m	Bitch, shut your mouth and get your  shit in the box.
JERRY	m	Let us go, please... let the girls  go.
BABY	f	Let us go, please... let the girls  go.
OTIS	m	Get in... now!
MOTHER	f	Wait, I want to say good-bye.
MOTHER	f	Bye sweety, we could of been great  together.
JERRY	m	Please, let us go, we won't tell  anybody.
MOTHER	f	Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
BABY	f	We won't tell anybody.
OTIS	m	Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot...  alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking  night.
JERRY	m	Please, please this is insane. You  can't do this.
OTIS	m	It is and I can... next.
OTIS	m	Where's she think she's a gonna get  to? She's gonna run all the way home.
BABY	f	No! Let me get her... ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun...  can I get her?
MOTHER	f	That's true, Otis... not that we're  having a bad time, but...
OTIS	m	Well, go get her.
BABY	f	There once was a woman who lived  with her daughter in a cabbage garden.
BABY	f	...along came a rabbit and ate up  all the cabbages. The woman said...
BABY	f	..."Go into the garden and drive out  the rabbit"...
BABY	f	"Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...
BABY	f	..."Come maiden," said the rabbit... ...sit on my tail and go with me to  my rabbit hutch.
DENISE	f	We've got get out of here, we got  get out of here.
JERRY	m	Think, think. Try to open the lid,  try to kick a hole in the wood.
DENISE	f	I can't... I can't move my arms. I  hurt so much.
JERRY	m	I know, but we can make it out of  here. We can do it.
JERRY	m	That was good babe, just keep doing  that.
DENISE	f	That's not me. I didn't... I'm not  doing that.
JERRY	m	Someone is out there... ...help, we're in here!
DENISE	f	Help, help us.
DENISE	f	Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!
DENISE	f	Jerry please answer me.
DENISE	f	Jerry... ...is that you?
DENISE	f	Go, go! Drive... drive!
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Hold on, girly, what's the problem?
DENISE	f	Murdering... blood and Jerry... ...monsters... I... I... I got away...
CAPT. SPAULDING	m	Well, I don't see what the fuck you're  getting at, but I got some friends  that live just up this road.
DENISE	f	No! No, that's it... that house is... ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!
