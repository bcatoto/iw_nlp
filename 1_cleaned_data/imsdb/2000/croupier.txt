JACK'S VOICE	m	Now he had become the still centre  of that spinning wheel of  misfortune.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The world turned round him...  leaving him miraculously untouched  The little white ball circles the  spinning wheel.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The croupier had reached his goal.  He no longer heard the sound of  the ball.
JACK'S VOICE	m	To begin with he was Jack Manfred...
GILES	m	Take a pew, Jack. You look well.  What's it been, two years since we  broke bread?
JACK	m	Three years, two months. March
GILES	m	What a memory you've got. Maths  always was your strong suit. What  happened to the moaning Lisa?
JACK	m	She went back to South Africa.
GILES	m	Did she? You were pretty thick at one time.
JACK	m	We all played the field.
GILES	m	Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then...
JACK	m	I want a job, Giles.
GILES	m	All right. As what?
JACK	m	I was thinking perhaps I could be  a reader. You employ readers, don't  you?
GILES	m	We do. For unsolicited manuscripts.  We pay twenty pounds a manuscript.  You might get two, maybe three in  a week. Can you live on sixty  pounds?
GILES	m	Sorry. This is a no-smoking office,  Jack. You've written a book, haven't  you? I didn't read it myself, but --
GILES	m	Give me ten minutes, Fiona.
GILES	m	Fiona used to read for me.
GILES	m	Let me tell you about our operation.  We like personality authors. People  the public recognises. Celebrity's  what sells books. We can always  find someone to do the writing.  First, we need the face. Then the  concept. Right now I'm looking for a soccer  novel. Something where a tycoon  buys a lousy team and takes it to  the top. Seven figure transfer  fees. Corruption all down the line.  Violence on and off the pitch.  Steroids. Got any concepts? It  could be a thug story. I tell you  what. Why don't you think about  it. A couple of pages.  The pitch.  Steroids. Got any concepts? It  could be a thug story. I tell you  what. Why don't you think about  it. A couple of pages. With plenty of sex, of course.
JACK	m	Interesting, Giles. I will think  about it.
GILES	m	Let me give you three words of  advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick  with it. Who persists wins. That's  my motto. Write, write, write.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack had three words for, Giles.  Go fuck yourself.
MAN'S VOICE	m	Jacko, if you're there, pick up. I  want to talk to you. It's important.
JACK	m	Dad, I'm here.
JACK SR.	m	How's it going?
JACK	m	Great.
JACK SR.	m	Found a job?
JACK	m	No.
JACK SR.	m	Well I've got something for you.  In London, I mean. I've been  chatting to some friends. Do you  know the Golden Lion casino? It's  in Bayswater, I believe... They're  looking for a dealer, a croupier.
JACK	m	That's not what I want to do, dad.
JACK SR.	m	Don't be stubborn. The pay won't  be grand, but it's regular. That's  what you need, isn't it? I know  you don't like taking my advice...
JACK	m	It's not that.
JACK SR.	m	I've set this up for you. Call the  Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds,  he's the Manager. I don't know him  personally, but I've spoken to his  boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give  yourself a break.
JACK	m	All right, I'll think about it.
JACK SR.	m	Just do it. You've got the knack,  you've got the personality, you  got that from me.
JACK SR.	m	You understand the punters. Think  about it, you can write during the  day and sleep knowing the bills  are paid.
JACK SR.	m	For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't  look a gift horse in the mouth.  Have you written that name down?  Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.
JACK	m	All right, dad. Yes, I'll call  him.
JACK	m	So how are you doing, dad?
JACK SR.	m	Great. I've just started a new  company. Solid financing. It's  good. I love you Jacko, you know that
JACK	m	Yes, I know that.
JACK SR.	m	Don't let yourself down.
JACK	m	I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
JACK SR.	m	Sorry to keep you. What'll you  have?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack knew something was wrong.  He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles  said three words.
JACK'S VOICE	m	JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still  wasn't quite right...
DRUNK'S VOICE	m	I want to fuck the whole world  over.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Welcome back Jack... to the house  of addiction.
REYNOLDS	m	David Reynolds, I'm the Manager  here. Sit down, John.
JACK	m	Jack.
REYNOLDS	m	You've been recommended by the  management here. They know your  father. He has a bit of a  reputation, hasn't he?
JACK	m	Has he?
REYNOLDS	m	In any case, I understand you've  had some previous experience... in  South Africa. You'll find the rules a little  different here. Before we start,  you haven't got a police record,  have you?
JACK	m	No.
REYNOLDS	m	Where did you go to school?
JACK	m	I was at Beadles.
REYNOLDS	m	I don't think I know that one.   Private, I suppose.
REYNOLDS	m	There are three types of casino in  the U.K. High volume. Small faction.  And MOTR. That's middle of the  road. Us.
JACK	m	Do you have a Salon Prive?
REYNOLDS	m	We tried. But there wasn't enough  business. The punters like company.
REYNOLDS	m	Let's see you handle the chips.
JACK	m	I have to assume the serial numbers  on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
REYNOLDS	m	We check every four days.
JACK	m	Why four? And not three or five?
REYNOLDS	m	It's the procedure here. Now sort  the chips.
JACK	m	Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
REYNOLDS	m	Any exceptions?
JACK	m	25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
REYNOLDS	m	Give me 365.
REYNOLDS	m	Very good. Now take these colours...
REYNOLDS	m	I want 780, but I want 500 in  denominations of 25.
REYNOLDS	m	Very good.
JACK	m	You use two alternating, don't  you?
REYNOLDS	m	We do.
JACK	m	Where's the magnet?
REYNOLDS	m	They've been tested.
JACK	m	No more bets.
REYNOLDS	m	Could you stop that for a minute?
JACK	m	I'm sorry, sir, I've called no  more bets.
JACK	m	23 Red. Odd.
REYNOLDS	m	Haven't you forgotten something?
JACK	m	I don't think so.
REYNOLDS	m	Wipe your hands.
REYNOLDS	m	Not with your own cloth. Besides,  your pockets will be stitched.
JACK	m	What happens if I want to sneeze?
REYNOLDS	m	You won't. Not without permission.
REYNOLDS	m	Fine. Now let's move on.
REYNOLDS	m	How many aces are left?
JACK	m	Five.
REYNOLDS	m	I make it six.
JACK	m	Five.
REYNOLDS	m	What makes you so sure?
JACK	m	It's a rule. Always stand by your  first count. The odds are you're  right.
REYNOLDS	m	Good call.
JACK	m	You want me to check?
REYNOLDS	m	I said good call.
JACK'S VOICE	m	It had taken him 45 minutes, but  Jack now had Mr Reynolds's number.  The man couldn't count.
REYNOLDS	m	Let me just run through a few  things. As a dealer you never  gamble, not anywhere. We'll need  your picture.
JACK	m	What for?
REYNOLDS	m	For the database. It can be accessed  by every casino in the country. We  have the same system for punters.
JACK	m	I don't gamble.
REYNOLDS	m	Ever?
JACK	m	I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds.
REYNOLDS	m	Next point. Friendships between  croupiers inside or outside the  casino are discouraged.  Relationships with females working  here are expressly forbidden.
JACK	m	We had the same rule at Sun City,  but it was impossible to check.
REYNOLDS	m	This isn't South Africa. We'd know,  because someone would report it.  Believe me, someone always does.
JACK	m	Does know? Or does report? What  would happen if I knew something  like that and didn't report it?
REYNOLDS	m	We'd know. There are no secrets in  this casino. You'd be punished.
JACK	m	How?
REYNOLDS	m	First offence: verbal warning.  Second offence: written warning.   That one's filed and sometimes  copied to the Gaming Board. My  discretion. Third offence: you're  sacked on the spot. You'd never  work in a casino in this country  again.  There's another rule: you're  forbidden to talk to or recognise  a punter outside the casino. If  you see someone who's gambled here,  even if it's just casually on the  street, you must ignore him. Or  her. You're not married, are you?
REYNOLDS	m	Girlfriend?
JACK	m	Yes.
REYNOLDS	m	She's not in the gaming business  is she?
JACK	m	No.
REYNOLDS	m	This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing  it to you now, but you'll never  see it again.
JACK	m	Very impressive.
REYNOLDS	m	We have tapes in here that go back  six months. Let me show you  something.
REYNOLDS	m	See that?  That was six weeks ago.  The dealer missed it. The guy up  here missed it, but I watch these  tapes after hours. Nothing gets by  me. Now the lady's in jail. It's  easier to take ten million pounds  from a bank than take one penny  from this casino.
REYNOLDS	m	You can start Monday week.
JACK	m	Fine.
REYNOLDS	m	That hair will have to go.
JACK	m	Fine.
REYNOLDS	m	Are you planning to make a career  in casino work?
JACK'S VOICE	m	And end up like you?
JACK	m	I just want the job.
REYNOLDS	m	Jack, you're not the usual type we  get here.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Mr Reynolds was right. It was true.  Jack was up above the world. An  artist, living in the clouds.  Looking down.
REYNOLDS	m	Excuse me...
REYNOLDS	m	I can't talk about this now... no,  I'm with somebody. They can wait!   I'll be home at the usual time...  all right, I'll call you back in  an hour... Don't ever get married, Jack. Casino  work doesn't mix with house and  garden. Any questions?
JACK	m	Yes. What's the salary?
JACK'S VOICE	m	The casino paid its staff monthly  in arrears. He would have to wait  six weeks for his first cheque. He  needed money now.
DEALER	m	What kind of deal you looking to?
JACK	m	What's the Blue Book price?
DEALER	m	That's not relevant. An old car  like this, it depends on the  condition.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The car was a gift from Jack's  father. That's to say, Jack Senior  had given it to him before the  bailiffs arrived.
DEALER	m	This ain't exactly what you'd call  mint.
JACK	m	How about fifteen hundred?
DEALER	m	How about five hundred.
JACK	m	What?!
DEALER	m	How about we split the diff...  Seven-fifty.
JACK	m	Is that your idea of arithmetic?
DEALER	m	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in  business.
JACK	m	Eight-fifty.
DEALER	m	Seven-fifty.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He suddenly wanted to be rid of  it. 'Hang on tightly, let go  lightly'. It was a saying Jack  remembered.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack imagined people reading his  book. One day he would enter their  heads, play with their imaginations,  test their feelings...
JACK'S VOICE	m	He would tell them you have to  make a choice in life. Be a gambler  or a croupier. And then live with  your decision come what may.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Marion saw life differently. She  was a romantic. And thought he was  too.
MARION	f	I couldn't resist them.
JACK	m	You mean I won't resist them.
MARION	f	No, no. I'm not ready for you.  There's some vodka in the freezer.
JACK	m	You want me drunk?
MARION	f	I won't be that long.
JACK	m	You really are a beautiful woman.
MARION	f	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
JACK	m	Turn around.
JACK	m	You're all I desire.
MARION	f	Where did you get it?
JACK	m	I. sold the car.
MARION	f	You shouldn't have done that. I  know what it meant to you.
JACK	m	I owe you for the rent. It's only  a car. I can get another.
MARION	f	Take it back. Till you sell your  book.
JACK	m	Come on, Marion. Let's face the  truth. Nobody's going to publish  it.
MARION	f	Of course they will. You just have  to be patient. I'm betting on you.
JACK	m	I'm not much of a bet.
MARION	f	You are to me.
MARION	f	Come into my world.
MARION	f	You're my prisoner.
JACK	m	I've got something to tell you.
MARION	f	I want to hear it.
JACK	m	I've got a job.
MARION	f	What job?
JACK	m	In a casino. As a croupier. A  dealer.
MARION	f	How did you land that?
JACK	m	It came my way. 450 a week.
MARION	f	450? What did you do, just walked  in and said I want to be a croupier?  Don't you need training?
JACK	m	I had training. In the Republic.
MARION	f	You were a croupier there? You  never told me that. I thought you  just knew some gamblers.
JACK	m	I start Monday week.
MARION	f	450 a week. I've never earned that  in my life. You're an enigma, you  are. A fucking enigma.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Not an enigma, just a contradiction.
MARION	f	You sold the car. You got a job.  What's the third thing? Tell me.
JACK	m	There's no third thing. Don't be  superstitious.
MARION	f	I love you Jack, you know that.
JACK'S VOICE	m	And he half-loved Marion. And she  knew that too.
JACK	m	Are you trying to read my palm?
MARION	f	You've got such beautiful hands.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The hands of a conjuror, a woman  had told him once. Or a card sharp.
MANICURIST	?	What line of work are you in?
JACK	m	I'm an undertaker.
MANICURIST	?	Really?
BARBER	m	Do you work round here?
JACK	m	My office is in Shanghai.
BARBER	m	What do you do?
JACK	m	I'm an arms dealer.
BELLA	f	I'm Bella.
JACK	m	Jack Manfred.
BELLA	f	Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit.
JACK	m	Is it that bad?
BELLA	f	How do I look?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Like trouble, Bella. You look fine.
BELLA	f	The punters love it. Tits in  uniform.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The usual bunch. They didn't know  Jack, but he knew them.
JACK	m	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
INDIAN	m	Where's the other fellow? Where's  Geoff?
JACK	m	He doesn't work here any more.
INDIAN	m	Well, let's hope you know your  job.
WOMAN	f	Tens, please.
WOMAN 2	f	Perhaps this man will bring us  luck.
WOMAN	f	What's that aftershave you're  wearing?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Never converse with the punters.  It slows things down. Speed is  volume, and volume is profit for  the casino. Aim at twenty spins an  hour.
JACK	m	Last bets, please.
MAN	m	You're new here. You'll get used  to Madame Claude. She comes in  once or twice a week and does that.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He knew the scam. Come in with  five grand cash. No questions asked.  Launder it by getting a casino  cheque when you cash in. Jack  wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted  it? After all there's was no profit  in it for the casino. Or was there?
JACK	m	Thank you very much, ladies and  gentlemen. I'm going to hand you  over now to my colleague. Goodnight.
MATT	m	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
REYNOLDS	m	Good work, Jack. You handled  yourself well.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Suddenly a delayed wave of elation  came over him.
REYNOLDS	m	Why don't you take a break, Jack.
JACK	m	All right, Mr Reynolds.
BELLA	f	Good evening, Mr Tchai.
MR TCHAI	m	Good evening.
REYNOLDS	m	Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.
WAITRESS	?	Your usual, sir?
WAITRESS	?	Thank you, sir. Enjoy your game.
JACK'S VOICE	m	�50 for a diet Coke. Waitresses  were the true winners in the casino.  They were the only members of staff  allowed to accept tips. On a good  night they could get between �200  and �300.
REYNOLDS	m	Mr Tchai always likes to play at  that table, and only with Bella.
JACK	m	Does he win?
REYNOLDS	m	He's a good customer.
JACK'S VOICE	m	A good customer is a consistent  loser. Was that what Mr Reynolds  meant?
MATT	m	Where do you live, Jack?
JACK	m	Over the river.
MATT	m	Have you got transport?
MATT	m	I'm going over the river. I'll  give you a lift if you like.
JACK	m	Thanks.
MATT	m	So how do you feel, your first  night? I'll bet you're on a high.
JACK	m	Nice car.
MATT	m	She's my baby.
JACK	m	How long have you worked at the  casino?
MATT	m	Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months.
JACK	m	You've done pretty well.
MATT	m	Not bad. I have other interests,  of course.
MATT	m	I'm off to a little watering hole.  Why don't you join me? Relax.
JACK	m	No thanks, Matt. I need my eight  hours.
MATT	m	I'll lay you five to one you won't  sleep. In this job you have to  unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you.  I mean that.
JACK	m	Some other time.
MARION	f	What's the time?
JACK	m	I don't know.
MARION	f	How did it go?
JACK	m	Fine.
MARION	f	You're shaking. What is it?
JACK	m	Tension. It'll go.
MARION	f	Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
MARION	f	I loved it blond.
JACK	m	It's only hair. I haven't changed.
MARION	f	When you get home, I'm asleep.  When I leave home, you're asleep.
JACK	m	I'll see you in my dreams.
JANI	m	In 20s, please...
JACK	m	Place your bets.
JANI	m	5...8...11.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack could see this woman was an  experienced gambler. Professionals  always place their bets through  the croupier. That way there are  no comebacks.
JACK	m	I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
MAN	m	What are you talking about? It's  11, I've won. With this lady.
JACK	m	You've won with the two chips you  placed earlier, but the third chip  was a late bet.
MAN	m	I put them on together.
JACK	m	I'm afraid that's not so, sir.
MAN	m	Now look here, you...
REYNOLDS	m	Is there a problem, sir?
MAN	m	Yes. This croupier is accusing me  of cheating.
JACK	m	It was a late bet. This gentleman  has been following the lady's  numbers and...
MAN	m	Do you think I cheated?
JANI	m	In my opinion... it was a late  bet.
REYNOLDS	m	I think we should talk about this,  sir. Away from the table.
MAN	m	No. I won. I want to be paid.
REYNOLDS	m	Pay the gentleman. In full.
JACK	m	I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept  gratuities in the UK. It's different  in South Africa.
JANI	m	You know where I'm from?
JACK	m	I've lived there.
JANI	m	Well, thank you anyway.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Bright woman, he thought. She knew  the rule of gold. Quit when you're  ahead.
JACK	m	Place your bets.
JACK	m	Look Matt, there's something I  have to say to you. I saw you  cheating.
MATT	m	What the fuck are you talking about?
JACK	m	That Greek guy who won at the end.  You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
MATT	m	I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it  wrong.
JACK	m	I'm not going to report it.
MATT	m	What are you, a cop?
JACK	m	If I see you do it again, I'll  report it.
MATT	m	I don't get you. Even if it was  true, which it isn't, what the  fuck difference would it make to  you?
JACK	m	Because if a supervisor knew I'd  seen you and I hadn't reported it,  I'd lose my job as well. And I  can't afford that.
MATT	m	So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack,  this whole business is bent. The  casino is nothing but legal theft.  And that's OK. It's the system.  Half the punters who come in are  using stolen money, drug money,  they haven't earned it. We earn  our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't  need an enemy.
JACK	m	You're talking about complicity.
MATT	m	I don't know what that means. I'm  talking about not rocking the boat.
MATT	m	OK, now let's unwind.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Matt was an escape artist. Like  Jack's father.
MATT	m	Hey, Andros!
MATT	m	This is Jack.
JACK	m	Who are these guys?
MATT	m	Mostly people in the casino  business. A few drug dealers.
JACK	m	And the girls?
MATT	m	Just girls. What are you drinking?
JACK	m	Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
MATT	m	Good call. Help yourself.
JACK	m	Does Bella come here?
MATT	m	That bitch? No.
MATT	m	Hey Jack, join us.
JACK	m	No thanks.
MATT	m	Don't worry, I won't report you!
JACK	m	I don't gamble.
GIRL	f	You don't gamble, but do you smoke?
JACK	m	Sometimes.
GIRL	f	How about now?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Marion. I'm on my way...
JACK	m	I'm off. I need to sleep.
MATT	m	Loosen up, Jack. If you don't,  this job'll get to you. The  pressure's too much, believe me,  it'll break you.
JACK	m	"The world breaks everyone, and  afterwards many are strong in the  broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
MATT	m	Wasn't he the one who shot himself?
MARION	f	Where've you been? I've got to  give evidence in court at nine.
JACK	m	Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
MARION	f	Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a  cop any more.
JACK	m	I take it back. You're not a cop  any more. You're a store detective.
MARION	f	Are you drunk?
JACK	m	Probably.
MARION	f	This fucking job's getting to you.  You haven't written a fucking word  since you started.
JACK	m	Do you have to swear all the time?
MARION	f	Well, that's my poor upbringing. I  didn't go to no private school. I  haven't got no class. I want to  live with a writer. Not a fucking  croupier. I don't even know what  the word means. Croupier.
JACK	m	Marion, stop this.
MARION	f	What do I mean to you? I want to  know. Tell me.
JACK	m	You're my conscience.
MARION	f	Haven't you got a conscience of  your own?
MARION	f	What are you doing here? You know the rules.
JACK	m	What about a drink on the way home?
MARION	f	I don't finish till eight. Make it  nine and you're on.
JACK	m	I'm on at nine.
MARION	f	Well, that's our life now, isn't  it?
JANI	m	Thinking of going back?
JACK	m	Oh hello.
JANI	m	You know what? I'd like to buy you  a drink.
JACK	m	It's against the rules. Dealers  are forbidden to talk to punters.
JANI	m	That's stupid. What are the odds  of you being seen with me?
JACK	m	Impossible to calculate.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack knew that, in reality, all  odds are calculable.
JANI	m	To coincidence.
JACK	m	There's a casino in this hotel.
JANI	m	I'm not much of a gambler really.  I just like this bar.
JACK	m	So why did you come to my casino?
JANI	m	I was at a loose end. A friend of  a friend gave me a courtesy  membership.
JACK	m	First visit to London?
JANI	m	No, no. I come every couple of  years. I always think I'm going to  stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
JACK	m	I was born in the Transkei, on the  Wild Coast.
JANI	m	Near the casino.
JACK	m	In the casino.
JANI	m	Now there's a coincidence. My father  used to gamble there.
JACK	m	Your father?
JANI	m	I loved the atmosphere. But it  destroyed my poor mother.
JACK	m	The debts.
JANI	m	And the lies. Gamblers are born  liars.
JACK	m	And superstitious too. It's like  witchcraft.
JANI	m	That's Africa. There's an African  in all of us, isn't there?
JACK	m	We all came from Africa, supposedly.
JANI	m	Do you believe in astrology?
JACK	m	Absolutely not. But then, I'm a  Gemini and Geminis don't believe  in astrology.
JANI	m	You know, you don't strike me as a  typical croupier.
JANI	m	I'm not married. I wear it to keep  the flies off. I must go. Let me pay for this.
JACK	m	Absolutely not.
JANI	m	Toss you for it.
JACK	m	I don't gamble.
JANI	m	I know this is verboten, but if  you feel like a chat or maybe  dinner, give me a call.
JANI	m	I'll understand if you don't. But I hope you do.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He didn't know why, but he'd started  to dress for the casino at home...
JACK'S VOICE	m	... like a musician in his tuxedo,  going to the concert hall on public  transport...
WOMAN	f	Animal!
JACK	m	Would you mind being more careful,  sir.
MAN	m	I've got 'flu.
WOMAN	f	Then go back home. To the zoo!
JACK	m	This gentleman accidentally coughed  onto these chips. I don't think it  would be hygienic to stack them...
SUPERVISOR	m	Agnes. These chips have to be  counted and put into the steamer.
AGNES	f	Yuck.
MATT	m	I can't give you a lift back  tonight.
JACK	m	Don't worry.
BELLA	f	Jack. Do you need a ride?
JACK	m	No. Thanks.
BELLA	f	My car's in the garage.
JACK	m	Maybe another time.
BELLA	f	I'll take you up on that.
JACK	m	Goodnight.
MAN	m	You don't recognise me? You had me  barred. You fucking little worm.
JACK	m	Wait a minute. You got yourself  barred.
MAN	m	It was you, you shit.
JACK	m	Now I'm going to kill you.
BELLA	f	Jack!
BELLA	f	Jack. Leave him! Come on!
BELLA	f	Let's go. We don't want the cops  here.
JACK	m	He won't cheat again.
BELLA	f	You're shaking.
JACK	m	It's the tension.
BELLA	f	Excuse the mess.
BELLA	f	Careful.
BELLA	f	Don't tear anything.
BELLA	f	It's funny, isn't it? If that guy  hadn't come up to you, you wouldn't  be here now.
JACK	m	I hate cheats.
BELLA	f	All men are cheats.
BELLA	f	I spent two years on the game. I  don't mind telling you that.
BELLA	f	But don't worry, I'm clean as a  whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing.
JACK	m	Why did you quit?
BELLA	f	I got scared.
JACK	m	I can imagine.
BELLA	f	Can you? I'm happy being a dealer.  At least the punters keep their  hands to themselves.
JACK	m	You called the casino a cesspit.
BELLA	f	Well it is. But I know where I am.
BELLA	f	I've been watching you work. You're  the best in the place. But you  know that.
JACK	m	I despise the job.
BELLA	f	Ah, we all say that. But if we  hate it, why do we do it?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack wanted to say we do it for  the money. But that wasn't really  true.
BELLA	f	What do you really want to do?
JACK	m	The Indian rope-trick.
BELLA	f	Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm  sorry. It's none of my business.   It's just that you're not like the  others.
JACK	m	Not like Matt, you mean.
BELLA	f	Now he's a real shit. Don't get  friendly with him. I'm sure he's  got his hand in the till. You know  what he said to me once? "I want  to fuck the whole world over. That's  my mission." The shit!
JACK	m	Ouch.
BELLA	f	Sorry.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack could hear Matt saying it...
JACK'S VOICE	m	"I want to fuck the whole world  over. It's my mission."
JACK'S VOICE	m	At last he had found what he'd  been looking for. A clear and simple  theme. And a hero to act it out.  Little Matt... ...Chapter One.
MATT	m	I look like shit.
JACK	m	Rough day?
MATT	m	Rough life, Jack.
PAT	m	Hi. I'm Pat.
JACK	m	What happened to Bella?
MATT	m	I'll tell you later.
MR TCHAI	m	What happened to Bella?
JACK	m	She was re-assigned.
JACK	m	Good evening.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack knew this was no coincidence.  Why had she come?
JANI	m	One thousand even. In fifties.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He wondered if she believed he  would bring her luck...
JANI	m	In fifties.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Or did she think he would help her  win?
JACK'S VOICE	m	He knew how to fix it for her. His  father had taught him the trick.  Switch the sequence. Bust the bank.  The casino wouldn't spot it. But  Jack was wary of the punters...
JACK'S VOICE	m	He could see Mr Tchai was counting.  He couldn't risk it.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He noticed she wasn't wearing her  ring. Why not? Odds on she'd sold  it.
JANI	m	Good night. Thank you.
JACK	m	Good night.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Thank you, she said. For what,  Jack thought. Jani de Villiers  knew the odds.
MR TCHAI	m	Pretty woman.
JACK	m	Hello...
JACK SR	m	How's it going, Jacko?
JACK	m	Fine. I took the job.
JACKSR	?	Good for you. I was wondering what  happened.
JACK	m	I tried to call you, dad, but they  said your line was disconnected.
JACK SR	m	Ah yes, I moved house. Needed a  bigger place. How's that book of  yours coming along?
JACK	m	I'm getting there.
JACK SR	m	It's good to have the job to fall  back on, isn't it? There goes my other phone.
JACK	m	Goodbye dad.
MARION	f	I don't like it.
JACK	m	Why not?
MARION	f	I don't like it at all. You had a  wonderful character before, the  Gambler. He was so romantic.
JACK	m	He was a loser. This guy's a  croupier. He can't lose. People  have shat on him all his life. Now  he's in control. He's a winner.
MARION	f	Is that your idea of a winner? He  doesn't give a shit about anyone.  He uses people and --
JACK	m	-- It's because of the sex, isn't  it? You don't like the sex in it.
MARION	f	I don't give a fuck about the sex.  Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's  just a miserable zombie. Is that  the way you feel now? Is that what's  happened to you?
JACK	m	Marion. It's a book.
MARION	f	Oh really. Then why is he called  Jake. Why don't you come clean and  call him Jack. There's no hope in it.
JACK	m	It's the truth.
MARION	f	Without hope there's no point to  anything.
JACK	m	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful  about your job? Spending the day  catching poor people stealing. You  said yourself the organised gangs  get away with it. At least in the  casino everybody gets caught. Rich  or poor, the odds are the same.  It's all relative.
MARION	f	Crap. It's not relative. It's  unfair. Like your casino. It's  designed unfair. And your croupier's  a little shit because he goes along  with it.
JACK	m	You're just like all those other  dummies out there. Fourteen and a  half million to one! Is that your  idea of hope?
MARION	f	The door, Jack.
JACK	m	Leave it.
MARION	f	No. Answer it!
BELLA	f	You fucking little shit! You shopped  me.
JACK	m	What are you talking about?
BELLA	f	Reynolds got a doctor in. They  forced me to take a dope test. It  was positive. As you knew.
JACK	m	I don't know anything about it.
BELLA	f	Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked  my dope, then shopped me. What do  you think of that? I can't get a  job now. You bastard. You're no different  from Matt. A pair of vicious little  shits, that's what you are.
JACK	m	Look Bella, I don't know anything  about this. You should talk to  Matt.
BELLA	f	You're all scumbags.
MARION	f	I agree.
JACK	m	Bella!
MARION	f	Go on. Go after her!
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack had no idea where Marion was  staying, or with whom. He realised  he knew little about her life. But  then, he had never asked about it.
JACK'S VOICE	m	For the first time in a long while  Jack thought about his mother.  She'd left when she couldn't take  it any more.  His father had said  'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come  back.' She didn't.
JACK'S VOICE	m	But Marion wasn't his mother...
JACK	m	He's paying out in stacks of 25.
REYNOLDS	m	I can see.
REYNOLDS	m	Little shit.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Chapter Three. His existence was  forming an interesting pattern of  betrayals. Sometimes he was unsure  whether he was the betrayer or the  betrayed.
REYNOLDS	m	Thanks for the information.
JACK	m	A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
REYNOLDS	m	She was a real asset. But what  could I do?
REYNOLDS	m	Sorry. No smoking in the Nest,  Jack.
GILES	m	Jack!
GILES	m	I thought it was you. It's the  hair!
JACK	m	I'm working on that soccer story.
GILES	m	Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
JACK	m	Habib?
GILES	m	My author. He's a Terrorist. He's  written a kill-and-tell book. Take care.
GILES	m	Jack, look, next weekend I'm having  a house party. Here... It's near Oxford. Why don't you  come? It'll just be social. No  business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of  room.
JACK	m	I'll try and make it.
GILES	m	Looking forward!
JACK'S VOICE	m	Books piled like chips. Stack 'em  high. Sell 'em fast. Make a killing.  You think you're a gambler, Giles,  but you're not. You're a dealer.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Chapter Four...
JACK	m	I don't know how you can drive at  night with those glasses.
JACK	m	How did you hurt your hand?
JANI	m	Just an accident. Nothing.
JACK	m	Turn left ahead.
JACK	m	Jani, there's something I want to  say. Before we get there. I don't  know what the sleeping arrangements  are. Giles probably expects us to  share a room.
JANI	m	That's fine.
JANI	m	There's no point pretending it was  an accident. I had a fight with  someone, that's all.
GILES	m	She's a dab hand With a racquet,  your friend.
JACK	m	South African women are very sporty.
GILES	m	I can see. How did she get that  shiner?
JACK	m	I found her in bed with someone.
GILES	m	Who was he?
JACK	m	She.
GIEES	?	I say. You're a dark horse, Jack.
GORDON	m	You don't play tennis?
JACK	m	I don't play anything.
GORDON	m	How boring for you.
FIONA	f	Where's our drinks?
CHLOE	f	They're so bloody selfish.
JANI	m	I'm so glad you brought me.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack wouldn't have come without  her.
JACK	m	I don't gamble.
GILES	m	Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a  few quid.
JACK	m	It's nothing to do with money. I  don't gamble.
JANI	m	He doesn't gamble.
JACK	m	I'll watch.
GORDON	m	Jack likes to watch. Does he like to watch?
JANI	m	One more remark like that and I'll  break your balls.
GILES	m	I'll bet she could, too.
JACK	m	I'll deal, but I won't play.
GORDON	m	You sure you know how?
FIONA	f	Do that again.
CHLOE	f	That's sexy.
FIONA	f	Don't they look pretty.
GILES	m	There's nothing pretty about this  hand.
CHLOE	f	You're not supposed to talk, Giles.
FIONA	f	He's probably lying. He does that.
JACK	m	Last hand.
GILES	m	Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't  we...
FIONA	f	No! No stripping.
CHLOE	f	Right. We're not having that again! Although...
GORDON	m	I'll stick to bluffing. That's  what I'm best at.
GORDON	m	I'll stick.
FIONA	f	Two cards.
GILES	m	One card.
CHLOE	f	Oh I don't know...Er...two cards.
JANI	m	Three cards.
FIONA	f	That's it. I haven't got any more  cash.
GORDON	m	Beat that.
CHLOE	f	Ha. Ha. Ha.
GORDON	m	Shit.
FIONA	f	Not so fast, darling.
GORDON	m	Hang on, chaps. That's impossible!
GILES	m	How's about that for impossible.
GORDON	m	What's going on?
CHLOE	f	Wow. What are the odds for this  happening?
FIONA	f	Thousands to one.
JACK	m	42,300,000 to 1.
JANI	m	Approximately.
GORDON	m	I could've won if I'd been able to  bluff.
GILES	m	I get it.
JACK	m	Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating?
GILES	m	Good God, no. But with skill like  that, what do you want a job for?  You don't need to work.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Here was an interesting question.  Was writing work... or play?
JANI	m	What happened?
JACK	m	Remember the guy who cheated at  the table?
JANI	m	You don't like cheats, do you.
JANI	m	Which side do you like?
JACK	m	You choose.
JANI	m	That trick tonight, I don't think  I've ever seen that before.
JACK	m	It can only work with amateurs, A  pro would have spotted it.
JANI	m	I didn't.
JACK	m	Then you're not a pro.
JANI	m	Goodnight.
JANI'S VOICE	m	Jack...? I need your help...
JANI	m	I'm in trouble.
JACK	m	What kind of trouble?
JANI	m	I owe a lot of money.
JACK	m	Was that why you did the two grand?  I couldn't help you.
JANI	m	I know that. But you can now.
JACK	m	I don't have any money.  switches  on the light. JANI is looking  distressed.
JANI	m	Some people I know, they're planning  to rob The Golden Lion.
JACK	m	You don't mean that.
JANI	m	They mean it.
JACK	m	Who's they?
JANI	m	My creditors. One night, around  three in the morning, they'll come  into the casino -
JACK	m	Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
JANI	m	The point is, they want a man  inside.
JACK	m	And I thought you were a bright  woman.
JANI	m	Just listen. You don't have to do  anything criminal.
JACK	m	Robbery's not criminal?
JANI	m	You don't have to be criminal. A  man will come up to your table and  deliberately cheat. You'll see  him, stop him, and the guy will  make a big scene. There'll be chaos.  And that's when it'll happen.
JACK	m	You're serious.
JANI	m	You won't be committing a crime.  The man will cheat, you'll just be  doing your job, that's all.
JACK	m	And I thought you were only after  my body.
JANI	m	I've come to know you. You're  honest. I trust you.
JACK	m	What'll you do when it all goes  wrong?
JANI	m	It won't.
JACK	m	But if it does.
JANI	m	You keep the ten thousand pounds.
JACK	m	What ten thousand pounds?
JANI	m	These people will pay you ten  thousand before and ten thousand  after. They want someone they can  be sure of, an honest dealer. That's  the point. Not all dealers are  honest. Mr Reynolds will never  suspect you.
JACK	m	Reynolds? You've done your research.
JANI	m	I didn't know what else to do.  You're my last chance.
JANI	m	Next time it'll be my neck.
JACK	m	What about my neck?
JANI	m	I want to go back to Cape Town, I  want to start again, clean.
JACK	m	I can't do it, Jani.
JANI	m	I'm asking you, as a...friend.  You'd be saving the life of a  friend.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack wondered why he was even  considering it. Ten grand. In cash.  That was why. But Jack didn't need  the money. His father would have  taken it, like a shot. But his  father was a gambler.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He was always broke. Jake suddenly  realised... it was Jake who was  considering it.
JANI	m	I want you to forget what I said.
JACK	m	Wait a minute...
JANI	m	No, forget it. The bet's off.
JACK	m	What about your father? Can he  help?
JACK	m	Why don't you just go back to South  Africa?
JACK	m	How much do you owe?
JANI	m	Let it go.
JACK	m	Did they tell you to sleep with  me?
JANI	m	I told you, all bets are off.
JANI	m	I'm sorry.
JACK	m	What for?
JANI	m	I have to take the car.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Hang on tightly... let go lightly.
GILES	m	Good night?
JACK	m	Not particularly.
GILES	m	And your lady?
JACK	m	She had to leave early. She asked  me to thank you.
GILES	m	A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
JACK	m	Not entirely.
GILES	m	How's that football story corning  along?
JACK	m	You said it was going to be social,  Giles. No business.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He was overcome with a sense of  urgency. He had to get it down...  Chapter Five.
JACK	m	It's beautiful. Thank you.
MARION	f	I hope it brings you luck.
JACK	m	It will.
JACK	m	That girl, she works at the casino --
MARION	f	-- I don't care about her. Of  course, I was angry. But not with  you. The book is yours not mine. I  was wrong, what I said about it. I  hurt you, didn't I?
JACK	m	You're entitled to your opinion.
MARION	f	It's none of my business what you  write. And your job, that's none  of my business either. I love you.  And I've done everything wrong.
JACK	m	I'll leave the casino soon. I promise.
MARION	f	You will?
JACK	m	Within a month. Believe me, I'm  going to quit!
MARION	f	Then you can dye your hair blond  again.
JACK	m	What?
MARION	f	You were talking in your sleep.
JACK	m	Not talking. Writing.
JANI'S VOICE	m	I need to see you. I've moved. I  have a new number. It's 468-3275.  Please call me.
JACK	m	I want to speak to Jani de  Villiers... Jani... it's Jack... I'll come  over now...
JACK'S VOICE	m	Chapter Seven... Jack had decided  to see her. The challenge was  essential.
JANI	m	Come in.
JANI	m	It's not the Ritz this time.
JANI	m	Is it yes?
JACK	m	Yes.
JANI	m	Thank you.
JACK	m	It doesn't seem fair. You're  offering me ten grand in cash but  you can't afford a decent place.
JANI	m	Well, life's not fair. We know  that.
JACK	m	It's all relative.  I need the  money too.
JANI	m	Do you?
JACK	m	Yes.
JANI	m	The date's not set yet. I'll call  you. One last thing: the man you're  going to catch cheating, he may  get violent. But you know how to  deal with cheats.
JACK	m	That bruise has cleared up nicely.
JANI	m	Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
JACK	m	I've still got mine.
JACK	m	And your hand too.
JANI	m	I took the bandage off yesterday.
JANI	m	Would you like a drink?
JACK	m	No thank you.
JACK	m	I don't think we should meet again.
JANI	m	It's a shame there aren't more men  in the world like you.
JACK'S VOICE	m	There was a part of Jani he really  liked.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Question: Was he gambling, taking  Jani's money? Answer: No. Because  he wasn't betting with his own  money. He was being paid in advance  for a service...
JACK'S VOICE	m	In reality there were two clear  elements of risk in this exchange.  One: the possibility the cash was  counterfeit. Two: the possibility  Jani or her creditors would want  the money back if the plan failed.
JACK'S VOICE	m	To begin with he put the odds at 2  against. 7 for. He checked a random  selection of bills at a bank. They  were all good.
JACK'S VOICE	m	So now his odds were decidedly  better. He put them at 8 to 1. The  fact that the notes were good gave  him one less negative. 2 minus 1.  At the same time mathematically he  had one more positive. 7 plus 1.
WOMAN	f	Bring me some luck.
JACK	m	No more bets.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Next stage. He had to be secure at  8 to 1 against having to give the  money back, so he wouldn't spend  it. If after one month no one had  approached him, he calculated the  odds of keeping it at 20 to 1.  After three months he figured 100  to 1 no one would turn up.
YOUNG MAN	m	How about a drink to celebrate?
MAN	m	Cash me in.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jake's experiment with the man  would prove the point.
JACK'S VOICE	m	People don't change.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He watched their faces as they  lost hour after hour, night after  night, relentlessly.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He questioned the conventional  wisdom that gamblers are self- destructive...
JACK'S VOICE	m	He had come to believe that in  reality, they want to destroy  everyone else - their families and  loved ones, everyone. Fuck over  the whole world...
JACK'S VOICE	m	Without emotion he watched them  go. Jake stayed.
JANI'S VOICE	m	It's set. The day after tomorrow.  The twenty-fourth. Good luck.
MARION	f	Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
JACK	m	Never. Why do you ask?
MARION	f	I can just imagine, being around  so much money all the time...
JACK	m	Gambling's not about money.
MARION	f	Really?
JACK	m	Gambling's about not facing reality.  Ignoring the odds.
MARION	f	I must be a fool. I never think  about the odds.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Chapter Twelve...
SUIT	m	Fifties. Ten of them.
JACK	m	What colour chips?
SUIT	m	Whatever.
JACK	m	Sir, I can't accept that bet.
SUIT	m	Are you calling me a cheat?
PUNTER	m	You are a cheat. I saw you.
SUIT	m	I'm talking to you.
REYNOLDS	m	Ladies and gentlemen, please be  calm. There's no cause for alarm.  Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.
NURSE	f	There you go.
JACK	m	How did you know I was here?
MARION	f	I thought you wouldn't want to  spend Christmas Day alone in here.
JACK	m	Did you go to the casino?
MARION	f	Happy Christmas.
MARION	f	Now...noodles or rice?
MARION	f	I don't want a criminal for a  boyfriend.
JACK	m	There was a message, wasn't there?
MARION	f	It's probably easier for you to  eat the rice.
JACK	m	Marion!  What did you tell the  police?
MARION	f	Nothing about you.
JACK	m	Then what?
MARION	f	Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or  I'll shop you. All you have to do  is keep your word. It's that simple.
MARION	f	Here...use a spoon.
JACK	m	Leave me alone, Marion.
MARION	f	You're already alone.
JACK'S VOICE	m	He had always been alone. He had  always believed it would make the  decisions easier.
JACK	m	All right. I don't want to lose  you. I'll quit. I swear to you.
MARION	f	Why did you take the money?
JACK	m	I hate public transport.
MARION	f	What?
JACK	m	I want to buy a car.
MARION	f	How can anyone be that naive?
REYNOLDS	m	How do you feel, Jack?
JACK	m	Bruised.
REYNOLDS	m	Take your time. Two weeks. Three  if you need it. We'll pay you sick  leave. I don't want to lose you.  You're a good man. Here...
JACK	m	What's this?
REYNOLDS	m	Happy New Year. Have a drink on  the company. You've earned it.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Chapter Thirteen...
JACK'S VOICE	m	It's all numbers, the croupier  thought. A spin of the wheel. A  turn of a card. The time of your  life. The date of your birth. The  year of your death. In the Book of  Numbers the Lord said: 'thou shalt  count thy steps'.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack thought, this is it. The famous  two in the morning knock at the  door.  It wad pay-back time.
JACK'S VOICE	m	But he wasn't afraid. He hadn't  spent one penny of the ten grand.  He'd covered himself. He knew the  odds.
POLICEMAN	m	Mr Manfred?
JACK	m	Yes...
JACK'S VOICE	m	What were the odds of being killed  by a car... on New Year's Eve?
MAN'S VOICE	m	She was on her way home... to you.
JACK	m	No. She wasn't.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Marion had been visiting his  mother...no, no, not his mother -  her mother.
JACK	m	She was visiting her mother. Her  mother. Who are you?
ROSS	m	Detective Inspector Ross.
JACK	m	Who...
ROSS	m	Ross.
JACK	m	Who did it? Tell me!
ROSS	m	We think it's a hit-and-run. A  drunk driver, probably, But there  is a possibility of a revenge  killing.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Revenge? For what? Whose revenge?
ROSS	m	As you know, she was a WPC with  the Met. up until two years ago.
ROSS	m	She called me last week. She'd got  wind of a planned robbery at your  casino.
JACK'S VOICE	m	What had that got to do with her  death?
ROSS	m	You didn't recognise the man who  attacked you, did you?
JACK	m	Of course I recognised him!
ROSS	m	You did?
JACK	m	I know a cheat when I see one. The  man was a cheat.
JACK	m	Do you gamble?
ROSS	m	If anything occurs to you, call  me.
ROSS	m	I was in love with her, you know.
JACK'S VOICE	m	'The world breaks everyone, and  afterward many are strong at the  broken places. But those that will  not break, it kills. It kills the  very good and the very gentle and  the very brave impartially. If you  are none of these, you can be sure  it will kill you too but there  will be no special hurry'.
MATT	m	Jacko! How're you doing? I heard about the raid. Pity they  didn't pull it off. I wish I'd  been there.
JACK	m	But you were there Matt.
MATT	m	What? You know what happened to  me, don't you? That bitch Bella  shopped me. I'd like to beat the  shit out of her.
JACK	m	I'd like to buy you a drink.
MATT	m	Cheers. Happy New Year. I really  like you, Jacko, you're so fucking  straight. Hey, you haven't changed your  clothes!
JACK'S VOICE	m	The music stopped, Jack was drunk...  hallucinating. He was back, as a  child, in the Wild Coast Casino.
LUCY	f	You've been avoiding me.
JACK	m	Have I?
LUCY	f	I'm Lucy.
JACK	m	And what do you do, Lucy?
LUCY	f	I'm a witch. A white witch. Why  don't we move on?
JACK	m	Are you going to put a spell on  me?
LUCY	f	I might.
JACK	m	Nice car. How much did you pay for  it?
LUCY	f	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
LUCY	f	Where to?
JACK	m	Turn left at the lights.
LUCY	f	Hey! I saw her!
LUCY	f	You don't trust women drivers, do  you?
JACK'S VOICE	m	Jack didn't trust anyone. Except  himself.
JACK'S VOICE	m	It was finally finished. He thought  of sending it to Giles. But that  wouldn't be right. He would select  a publisher at random, like a  number.
PUNTER	m	You're wasting yourself. With your  luck you ought to come over to our  side.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Even his publisher had no idea who  the author was. He had done the  deal through a lawyer. It gave him  a good feeling, no one knowing...
JACK'S VOICE	m	...It never occurred to anyone at  the Casino that the Golden Lion  had been his model. Why should it?  Weren't all casinos the same....
JACK'S VOICE	m	...It gave him an exquisite  pleasure, being an underground  man. With all his money, he hadn't  even bought a car. Jack knew the  truth about himself, he was a one- book writer. A one time winner who  had quit while he was ahead...
JACK'S VOICE	m	He changed nothing in the flat,  bought nothing, spent nothing. The  only thing he did was to remove  the bars outside the window...
JACK	m	Hello...
JANI	m	Jack! It's Jani.
JACK	m	Jani! Where are you?
JANI	m	Sun City. I've been meaning to  call you for months.
JACK	m	How are you?
JANI	m	Great. I'm getting married. At  least, I think I am.
JACK	m	Did you solve your problems?
JANI	m	Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack,  hold on a minute. There's someone  here who wants to talk to you...
JACK SR'S VOICE	m	Jacko - how're you doing?
JACK	m	Dad!
JACK SR	m	I never thanked you properly for  your help. Jani told me you behaved  like a perfect gentleman throughout.  I knew you would. I know my son.
JACK SR'S VOICE	m	The woman thinks I'm going to marry  her. But you know me. It's a shame  things didn't work out. But we saw  you all right. You didn't gamble  the ten grand, did you?
JACK	m	As a matter of fact I did. But I  won.
JACK SR'S VOICE	m	That's my boy. How's that novel of  yours coming along?
JACK'S VOICE	m	So that was it. The final card.  Blackjack. His father, eight  thousand miles and twenty seven  years away, was still dealing to  his son Jack from the bottom of  the deck...
JACK'S VOICE	m	...But Jake the croupier had a  sense of humour.
JACK	m	To you. To both of you.
BELLA	f	What are you laughing at? Who was  that on the phone?
JACK	m	A couple I know are getting married.
BELLA	f	Fools.
JACK'S VOICE	m	Now he had reached the point where  he no longer heard the sound of  the ball...
JACK'S VOICE	m	...the spin of the wheel had brought  him home to the place where he was  born.
JACK'S VOICE	m	The croupier's mission was  accomplished.
JACK'S VOICE	m	At last he was Master of the Game.  He had aquired the power... to  make you lose.
