LOUIS	m	So...what do you think? 
RACHEL	f	It's gorgeous! 
ELLIE	f	Am I really gonna have my own room? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. 
ELLIE	f	Yaay! Is that a swing? 
RACHEL	f	Yes, but the rope might be-- 
ELLIE	f	Yaay! 
LOUIS	m	Let her go. It's cool. 
RACHEL	f	Louis, the house is beautiful. 
RACHEL	f	The Master of Disaster awakes. 
LOUIS	m	And Buckaroo Banzai. 
RACHEL	f	Come on--let's parole 'em. 
RACHEL	f	Decided to wake up and see what home looks like, huh? 
LOUIS	m	Ellie, you heard your m--- 
ELLIE	f	Wh-- 
ELLIE	f	Hurrts! It hurrrrts! 
LOUIS	m	Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee. 
GAGE	m	Hi-Durch! 
CHURCH	m	Waow! 
GAGE	m	Druck! 
RACHEL	f	Gage's gone! 
LOUIS	m	Jesus, the road! 
GAGE	m	Drucks! No shit, Sherlock. 
RACHEL	f	Gage! He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus. 
RACHEL	f	Thank you. Thank you so much. 
LOUIS	m	Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. 
JUD	f	Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. 
RACHEL	f	I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. 
JUD	f	No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. 
JUD	f	Who might you be, little Miss? 
ELLIE	f	I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause) At least, I used to. 
JUD	f	And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. Are clams really happy? 
RACHEL	f	Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. 
JUD	f	Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff? 
LOUIS	m	No-I guess not. 
ELLIE	f	Yayyy! I guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all. I guess not. 
JUD	f	House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. 
LOUIS	m	Hey--they actually found the place! 
JUD	f	Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want. 
LOUIS	m	Well, maybe I---- Louis, what's this? 
FIRST MOVER	m	You Mr. Creed? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. Just a second. 
LOUIS	m	The movers-- 
RACHEL	f	Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? 
LOUIS	m	I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. I bet Mr. Crandall knows! 
JUD	f	Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in. 
LOUIS	m	Great. 
RACHEL	f	You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? 
LOUIS	m	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and--- 
RACHEL	f	---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- 
LOUIS	m	Did you see his shirt? Sure. Bruce Springsteen. 
LOUIS	m	I really do have a million questions about the area...but the thing I'm really curious about is how come this octogenarian Yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the Boss. 
LOUIS	m	It's me. 
JUD	f	Well, come on up and have a beer. 
JUD	f	You need a glass? 
LOUIS	m	Not at all. 
JUD	f	Good for you. 
LOUIS	m	God, that's fine. 
JUD	f	Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself. 
LOUIS	m	What were you listening to? 
JUD	f	Allman Brothers. 
LOUIS	m	What? 
JUD	f	The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis. 
JUD	f	I'm sorry. Wait. 
JUD	f	Try that. 
LOUIS	m	Nice. 
JUD	f	I like rock and roll. No...I guess that's too mild. I love it. Since my ears started to die out on me, it's the only music I can really hear. And since my wife died...I dunno, some- times a little rock and roll fills up night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause) One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope your time here will be a happy one. Thank you, Mr. Crandall. 
LOUIS	m	The one that goes into the woods--sure. 
JUD	f	That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there. 
LOUIS	m	What's at the end of it? Another day--after you get settled in a bit. Meantime, doc--- Here's to your bones. 
LOUIS	m	And yours. 
LOUIS	m	Church! God, you scared the life out of me! 
CHURCH	m	Waow! 
JUD	f	Take a look behind you. 
LOUIS	m	My God! 
RACHEL	f	It's beautiful! 
JUD	f	You folks ready to go on? 
LOUIS	m	Sure. 
ELLIE	f	But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? 
JUD	f	You'll see soon enough, hon. 
LOUIS	m	Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies? 
JUD	f	Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands. Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac. Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it? You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc? 
LOUIS	m	Not yet...how much further is it? 
JUD	f	Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile. 
ELLIE	f	What's it say, mommy? 
RACHEL	f	It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's misspelled, but...that's what it says. 
RACHEL	f	Ellen--! 
JUD	f	I told you it was a bad road, Louis--it's killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy. But at least something good come of it. This place. Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it! 
RACHEL	f	How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! 
JUD	f	Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah! 
LOUIS	m	I think it's rather extraordinary. 
RACHEL	f	Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. 
JUD	f	Well...they have to learn about death somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed? The little ones? Why? 
JUD	f	Well...well, because-- Mommy! Daddy! Look at me! 
ELLIE	f	It's okay, Mr. Crandall-- 
LOUIS	m	Have you got a death-wish, Ellen? 
ELLIE	f	Well, I thought it was safe-- 
JUD	f	Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite. 
ELLIE	f	Bite? 
JUD	f	Ayuh. 
ELLIE	f	I want to look around, daddy-- may I? 
LOUIS	m	For a little while. 
LOUIS	m	I can hardly read these. 
JUD	f	Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle. (Points) Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there... (points) the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat  got...and I think that's the cat  himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure. Missy Ellen! Come over here just a  minute! 
JUD	f	I see you're quite a reader for such a little girl. Can you read that? 
ELLEN	f	"Spot a good fellow we love you boy." (Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..." Gee, I can't read the rest. 
JUD	f	Last name's Crandall, little missy. 
JUD	f	That's where I buried my dog Spot when he died of old age in 19 and 14. Dug it good and deep. By the time I finished, I had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back. Soil's stony up here. 
JUD	f	Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is? 
ELLIE	f	Well...I guess not. 
JUD	f	It's a place where the dead speak, Missy. 
JUD	f	No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the  marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis? 
LOUIS	m	I think it is so, Ellie. 
ELLIE	f	What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? 
JUD	f	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it? 
ELLIE	f	Yes-- 
LOUIS	m	And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot. 
ELLIE	f	To remember. Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary place, Ellie. It's a place of rest and speaking. Can you remember that? Yes, sir. 
ELLIE	f	Mommy! This is a place where dead animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so! 
LOUIS	m	My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed. 
JUD	f	Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy. 
ELLIE	f	Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there because of the road, isn't it? 
ELLIE	f	That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. 
LOUIS	m	Well, it's always better to take precautions--but I'm sure Church will be all right, honey... 
ELLIE	f	In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? 
LOUIS	m	Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time. 
ELLIE	f	It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! 
LOUIS	m	If it was up to me I'd let Church live to be a hundred...but I don't make up the rules. Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not mine! Not-- 
RACHEL	f	She's finally asleep. 
LOUIS	m	She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid. 
RACHEL	f	It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it. 
LOUIS	m	Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you? 
RACHEL	f	Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die. 
LOUIS	m	Rachel...someday Church is going to  die. That is hardly the point! Church is not going to die today, or tomorrow-- Never mind. I can see you don't have the slightest idea what I'm talking about. 
LOUIS	m	Rachel--! 
ELLIE	f	Yee-uck! Gross! 
LOUIS	m	He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years. 
ELLIE	f	I don't want him to get his nuts cut, daddy! What if he dies? 
LOUIS	m	Good God! Where'd you hear that? 
ELLIE	f	Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation! 
RACHEL	f	Honey, Church will be fine. 
ELLIE	f	But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? 
RACHEL	f	Don't be silly. Church is not going to die. 
LOUIS	m	According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks. 
RACHEL	f	That's enough of that kind of talk! 
LOUIS	m	I just said-- 
RACHEL	f	I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. I'm scared. What if school here isn't like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want to go h-h-home! 
RACHEL	f	You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. 
LOUIS	m	And Church will be fine. Do you promise, Daddy? 
LOUIS	m	Well, honey...you know that... 
RACHEL	f	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. Church will be fine. I promise. 
ELLIE	f	Yayyyy! 
RACHEL	f	Thank you, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her. 
RACHEL	f	Have a great day! 
GAGE	m	Bye-bye! 
MISSY	f	Gonna get his-- 
LOUIS	m	--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy, for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughter's vocabulary. 
MISSY	f	Don't mention it. How's that belly-ache of yours? No better and no worse. 
LOUIS	m	You ought to see a doctor about it. 
MISSY	f	It'll pass. They always do. 
RACHEL	f	Thank God. I was a little worried there. Have a great first day at school, doc. No broken bones. Not so much as a sprain. 
CHARLTON	m	Holy Jesus. Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed, we've got a mess here! Stat! 
GIRL	f	Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic! Get her out. Get them all out. No! No! He can't die! He can't die! 
LOUIS	m	Steve, get the ambulance over here right now. He's got to go to EMMC. 
STEVE	m	The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco downtown, getting-- 
LOUIS	m	--a new muffler, oh shit-- 
CANDYSTRIPER	?	I can't look at it...I can't stand it... Yes you by God can. Go get the hard stretcher! 
LOUIS	m	Help me hold him. 
STEVE	m	It wouldn't matter if we did have the ambulance. 
LOUIS	m	It wouldn't matter if we had the SST. 
LOUIS	m	He's going. Steve, go call the motor- pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon. 
CHARLTON	m	It won't-- 
LOUIS	m	I know it won't! But let's for God's sake do it by the rules! 
LOIS	?	There wasn't even supposed to be a sprain today, my friend--that's what I told her. 
PASCOW	?	...Pet Sematary... W-What did you say...? 
PASCOW	?	It's not the real cemetery... (Long pause) The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis...a man grows what he can...and tends it. 
LOUIS	m	How do you know my name? I'll come...to you. Dammit, how do you know my name? 
STEVE	m	Louis, they're sending a-- 
LOUIS	m	Steve, will you get a sheet to cover him with? 
LOUIS	m	He said my name. I heard it. He said my name. 
PASCOW	?	Come on, doc. We got places to go. 
PASCOW	?	Come on, doc--don't make me tell you twice. 
PASCOW	?	Let's go, doc. I don't like this dream. 
PASCOW	?	Who said you were dreaming? 
PASCOW	?	This is the place where the dead speak. 
LOUIS	m	I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I-- 
PASCOW	?	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know. 
LOUIS	m	Please, I want to wake up. Leave me  alone. It's not my fault you died; you  were as good as dead when they brought you in-- 
PASCOW	?	The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. 
LOUIS	m	Leave me alone! 
PASCOW	?	Remember. 
LOUIS	m	Getting there. 
RACHEL	f	I got eggs down here! 
LOUIS	m	Good d-- 
JUD	f	Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days? 
LOUIS	m	For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about? 
JUD	f	Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's. 
LOUIS	m	Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus. 
LOUIS	m	It's Church. 
JUD	f	I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered. 
LOUIS	m	Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty. 
JUD	f	Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. 
LOUIS	m	Bagged cat. What a mess. 
JUD	f	You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary? I guess that's what it's there for, huh? 
JUD	f	Going to tell Ellie? 
LOUIS	m	I don't know. 
JUD	f	Seems like you told me about a promise you made-- 
JUD	f	Cat's just as dead, Louis. Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm sorry, Jud. 
JUD	f	No need to apologize. 
LOUIS	m	Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know? Maybe there's a better way. 
LOUIS	m	Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back. 
JUD	f	It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to. 
LOUIS	m	But-- 
JUD	f	Does she love the cat? 
LOUIS	m	Yes, but-- 
JUD	f	Then come on. 
LOUIS	m	Well, folks, here we are, in Louis Creed Dreamland. 
JUD	f	What say, Louis? 
LOUIS	m	Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one? 
JUD	f	We're still not where we're going. 
LOUIS	m	What do you mean? 
JUD	f	The place we're going is on the other side of that. 
LOUIS	m	We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks! 
JUD	f	No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure. 
LOUIS	m	I'm not climbing that. 
JUD	f	Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself. 
LOUIS	m	Let's go. Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up. 
LOUIS	m	God, this is amazing! 
JUD	f	Just don't stop and-- 
LOUIS	m	And don't look down. Right. 
JUD	f	Louis! You all right? Sure. I guess I just lost my happy  thoughts for a second there. I shouldn't have stopped...and it does bite. 
JUD	f	No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud? 
JUD	f	You'll see before long. Let's go. 
JUD	f	This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis-- you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow me and don't look down. 
JUD	f	Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp. 
LOUIS	m	Is there quicksand? 
JUD	f	Ayuh. Are there ghosts? 
JUD	f	Ayuh. 
JUD	f	There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	You're telling me. 
LOUIS	m	It's funny, all right. 
JUD	f	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God. (Pause) And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear. 
JUD	f	Almost there, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	You keep saying that. 
JUD	f	This time I mean it. 
JUD	f	This was their burying ground, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	Whose burying ground? 
JUD	f	The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat. 
LOUIS	m	Why? For God's sake, why? 
JUD	f	I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right? 
LOUIS	m	I guess so...but... 
JUD	f	You want to rest a bit before you start? 
LOUIS	m	No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin. 
JUD	f	Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage. 
JUD	f	I'm going to sit over yonder and have a smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to do it yourself. Each buries his own. That's how it was done then. 
LOUIS	m	You think so? 
LOUIS	m	What are those for? 
JUD	f	Your cairn. 
LOUIS	m	Doesn't look like they last long. 
JUD	f	Don't worry about that. 
LOUIS	m	Jud, why am I doing all this? 
JUD	f	Because it's right. 
LOUIS	m	Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if you were worth all this aggravation, but you were a hell of a good cat. 
JUD	f	That's fine. You did real good. 
LOUIS	m	Oh, shit! Rachel! 
JUD	f	When you talk to 'em, not one word about what we done tonight. 'S'far's you know, the cat's still fine. 
JUD	f	You'll understand. In the meantime, keep your peace. What we did, Louis, was a secret thing. Women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets, but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you she's never seen into a man's heart. The soil of a man's heart is stonier, Louis--like the soil up there in the old Micmac burying ground. A man grows what he can...and tends it. 
LOUIS	m	But-- 
JUD	f	No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight. 
LOUIS	m	Hi, Dory...it's Louis-- 
LOUIS	m	That'd be real fine. Hi...daddy? Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy birthday to you! That was awful, daddy. 
LOUIS	m	Yeah, I know...how are things out  there in Chicagoland? 
ELLIE	f	Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. Way to go, Gage! What? 
LOUIS	m	I said that's too bad. What did you get for presents from Gramma and Grampa? Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and a Chatty Cathy doll... 
ELLIE	f	...and a Garfield radio! How's Church, dad? Does he miss me? 
LOUIS	m	Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie. I haven't seen him this evening, but-- 
ELLIE	f	Well, make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he can't run out in the road and get greased. And kiss him goodnight for me. Yuck! Kiss your own cat! 
ELLIE	f	Want to talk to Gage? 
LOUIS	m	Food, Church...food! 
LOUIS	m	Come on, Church! Chow down! 
LOUIS	m	In a second. 
LOUIS	m	Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded Christ, he ch-- 
LOUIS	m	Ow! 
LOUIS	m	What did we do? 
JUD	f	I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception. 
LOUIS	m	What did we do, Jud? 
JUD	f	Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis! 
LOUIS	m	I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But... 
JUD	f	Wouldn't wash? 
LOUIS	m	No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it? 
JUD	f	Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids just called him Stanny B. He was half Micmac himself. 
LOUIS	m	Can I have another one? 
JUD	f	I guess it wouldn't hurt. 
JUD	f	The Micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came. 
JUD	f	They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground. 
LOUIS	m	Wendigo? 
JUD	f	Spirit of the north country. Not a good spirit. Wendigos are great liars and tricksters, according to the stories.  And if one touches you... 
JUD	f	Maybe it really was a Wendigo-- I ain't the one to say it wasn't-- or maybe it was just some disease. Whatever the reason, those that were left moved on. But they left that place...the way it is now. 
LOUIS	m	You and this old Indian rag-man-- 
JUD	f	Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back. 
LOUIS	m	How did your mother take it, Jud? How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead? 
JUD	f	Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. 
JUD	f	Why, then, things should be fine. 
LOUIS	m	A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown. 
JUD	f	She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie. 
JUD	f	A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die. 
LOUIS	m	What? 
JUD	f	Ellie's a little scared of death. And the main reason Ellie's that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death. Now you just go ahead and tell me I'm wrong. 
RACHEL	f	Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. 
PASCOW	?	The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. 
LOUIS	m	You don't understand-- 
PASCOW	?	Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc. 
LOUIS	m	Promise... 
LOUIS	m	How the hell did you get in? 
ELLIE	f	Daddy! 
LOUIS	m	Hi, sugar! 
ELLIE	f	Daddy, is Church all right? 
LOUIS	m	Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left. 
ELLIE	f	Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. That was a silly dream, wasn't it? 
ELLIE	f	Is he really all right? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. 
ELLIE	f	Because you promised. 
LOUIS	m	I know. 
RACHEL	f	Want to take your son, doc? 
RACHEL	f	Yes--you have to take them to someone who grooms animals, though. I think it's pretty expensive. I don't care. I'll save up my allowance and pay for it. Church smells bad. 
LOUIS	m	I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen. 
ELLIE	f	I hate that smell. 
LOUIS	m	Yes--I hate it, too. 
ELLIE	f	They're all turning on their lights! Daddy, why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day? 
JUD	f	They do it to honor the dead, Ellen. 
ELLIE	f	Is that right, dad? 
LOUIS	m	Yes. To honor the dead. 
JUD	f	Rachel not feeling well? 
LOUIS	m	Well...a touch of the flu... 
ELLIE	f	She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- 
LOUIS	m	That's enough, Ellen. 
JUD	f	Out of the mouths of babes, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	This babe has said enough. 
LOUIS	m	Hop in, Ellie. 
JUD	f	Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on. 
LOUIS	m	My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits." 
JUD	f	Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis? 
LOUIS	m	It's Ellie's cat. 
JUD	f	Nope. He's your cat now. 
LOUIS	m	Ellie? What's wrong? 
ELLIE	f	No more chocolate chip cookies. 
LOUIS	m	Huh? 
ELLIE	f	Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! 
NEWSCASTER	?	Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems almost beyond doubt: the dead are returning to eat the living. Daddy? 
LOUIS	m	What's up, sugar? 
ELLIE	f	Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? 
LOUIS	m	What? 
ELLIE	f	At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. 
LOUIS	m	Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear. 
LOUIS	m	But don't you dare say that. 
ELLIE	f	I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? 
LOUIS	m	I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children-- 
ELLIE	f	Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. 
LOUIS	m	Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard. 
ELLIE	f	Do you believe that? 
LOUIS	m	I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that. 
ELLIE	f	You believe in it. 
LOUIS	m	Oh, faith's a little more than just believing. 
ELLIE	f	I don't get it. 
LOUIS	m	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow? 
ELLIE	f	Yeah, sure. 
LOUIS	m	Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right? 
LOUIS	m	But we plan on that chair. We believe in that chair. And I plan on going on somehow as Louis Creed, after I die. I believe I will. You have faith in that. 
LOUIS	m	Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that it is now time for Ellen Creed to get ready for bed. So buzz. 
ELLIE	f	I'm not tired! 
LOUIS	m	I'm sure you're not. 
ELLIE	f	Then why do I have to go to bed? 
LOUIS	m	Because your mother and I need the rest, sugar. Now buzz. 
RACHEL	f	I heard you tonight. 
LOUIS	m	I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised-- 
RACHEL	f	That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda. 
LOUIS	m	Your sister, I know. 
RACHEL	f	Sometimes you're so good with her, Louis--so straight with her--that you make me ashamed of myself. 
RACHEL	f	I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard. 
LOUIS	m	That's forgotten. 
RACHEL	f	Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know. 
LOUIS	m	Yes, I guess I do. 
RACHEL	f	I'm going to try to do better. 
LOUIS	m	You're doing fine. 
GAGE	m	Go, dayee! 
LOUIS	m	Hey, Gage! 
GAGE	m	Dat? 
LOUIS	m	String! You're flying it, Gage--you got the hammer, my man! 
GAGE	m	Gage fline it? 
LOUIS	m	Bet your boots. Look-- 
LOUIS	m	See? 
GAGE	m	Gage fline it!! Bet your ass, little hero. 
IRWIN	m	You-- 
RACHEL	f	Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT! 
IRWIN	m	How do you like that, you son of a bitch? I should have done it sooner! 
IRWIN	m	How do you like that? How do-- 
MARCY	f	Stop them. Right now. 
IRWIN	m	Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll take y'apart! 
STEVE	m	Stop it! 
STEVE	m	Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with you, Louis? It's your son's funeral, not a boxing match! 
PASCOW	?	A man grows what he can...and tends it. 
ELLIE	f	I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! 
RACHEL	f	In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. 
IRWIN	m	I don't know what happened to me. Louis, please-- I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry, little hero. 
ELLIE	f	It got away from him! That numb shit! Ellen Creed! 
GAGE	m	Kite fline too fast! 
JUD	f	Don't let him go in the road, Louis! Get him, Louis! 
JUD	f	Your father-in-law packs a wallop, for an old guy. He and his wife gone back to Chicago? 
LOUIS	m	No...squatting out there at the Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures. He really thinks Rachel's going to go back with them. Her and Ellie. 
JUD	f	Louis-- 
JUD	f	What you got there, Ellie? Why that's real nice...you pullin' him on a sled. Bet he liked that, didn't he? I used to pull 'im a lot. 
ELLIE	f	I'm going to carry this picture, Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage come back. 
JUD	f	Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but-- 
ELLIE	f	He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- 
LOUIS	m	Ellie-- 
ELLIE	f	And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... 
JUD	f	Louis, take care of your little girl...she needs you. 
ELLIE	f	G'night daddy. 
ELLIE	f	God could take it back if He wanted to, couldn't He? If He really, really wanted to? Can I have faith in that? 
LOUIS	m	Yes--I suppose you can. Good night, Ellie. 
JUD	f	I got you a fresh beer out of the fridge, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just-- 
JUD	f	You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis. 
LOUIS	m	I'm thinking about going to bed. 
JUD	f	You never asked me if anyone had buried a person up there in the Micmac burying ground-- 
JUD	f	--but I think the thought has crossed your mind. 
LOUIS	m	Shit! Look at this mess! 
JUD	f	Ayuh--it's a mess, all right. 
JUD	f	I know the Micmacs thought it was a holy place...and then they thought it was a cursed place. That's why they moved on. 
LOUIS	m	Because something called a wendigo soured the ground. 
JUD	f	And because the dead walked. 
JUD	f	Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've been thinking of has been done. 
LOUIS	m	I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud? 
JUD	f	Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better. Tell that to my wife and little girl. 
JUD	f	It ain't your wife and little girl that's got me worried, Louis. 
JUD	f	Come on. 
ALAN	m	Oh holy Jesus lookit that. 
BILL	m	You men get out of here! 
JUD	f	I heard your boy was killed down Georgia. That was a mistake! 
HANNIBAL	m	Was it? 
BILL	m	You see him standing there, don't you? Now get out! Get the Christ off my land! Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an! Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can smell him! 
BILL	m	He ain't dead! Give him a day or two and he'll be fine! Don't you say that! 
JUD	f	Bill, this ain't right--you can see that yourself-- 
JUD	f	God help you, Bill. 
LOUIS	m	What happened? 
JUD	f	Get out, Billy--the place is going up. 
BILL	m	I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall! 
ALAN	m	You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud? If he don't, he don't. 
TIMMY	m	LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING! 
GATE AGENT'S VOICE	m	This is the final call for United's flight 61 to Chicago... 
LOUIS	m	You better get going, hon. 
RACHEL	f	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- 
LOUIS	m	I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy. 
RACHEL	f	Louis, are you sure? 
LOUIS	m	I'm sure. 
ELLIE	f	I don't want to go to Chicago, Gramma Dory. 
DORY	f	Why not, darling? 
ELLIE	f	I had a bad dream last night. A nightmare. About what? 
ELLIE	f	About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage. 
ELLIE	f	And someone named Paxcow. 
LOUIS	m	Come on, you guys--before you miss the boat. 
IRWIN	m	Louis, I am sorry. What can I say? That I lost my mind? It's the truth, but no good excuse. We all lost our minds, Irwin. 
LOUIS	m	Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you. 
ELLIE	f	Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! 
LOUIS	m	I'll be there in three days--four at the most. I've got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer ain't after you, and-- 
LOUIS	m	Of what? I don't know. Everything's going to be all right, Ellie. Now go on--get aboard. 
ELLIE	f	Do you swear? 
LOUIS	m	I swear. 
CLERK	m	Anything else for you today? I think we got it all. 
CLERK	m	Looks like heavy work. 
LOUIS	m	It could be. 
ELLIE	f	Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
RACHEL	f	Ellie...Ellie...what... 
ELLIE	f	Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! 
LOUIS	m	It's wrong. (Pause) What happened to you is wrong. 
PASCOW	?	The barrier was not meant to be crossed. The ground is sour. 
LOUIS	m	I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong. 
PASCOW	?	Timmy Baterman. That was wrong. 
LOUIS	m	Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard. 
LOUIS	m	If it doesn't work--if he comes back like Timmy Baterman--I'll put him to sleep. But I'm going to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't work...they don't ever need to know. 
ELLIE	f	Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He-- 
RACHEL	f	Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman? 
ELLIE	f	He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. 
RACHEL	f	There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense. 
ELLIE	f	Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay? 
RACHEL	f	Of course I will. 
RACHEL	f	Now will you try to go to sleep? Yes, Mom. 
PASCOW	?	Pascow. 
RACHEL	f	Pascow? Was she saying Pascow? 
RACHEL	f	He's not home. 
DORY	f	Why, he probably went out for a hamburger or a chicken dinner, dear. You know how men are when they're alone. 
RACHEL	f	It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm calling from Chicago. Chicago! Is Louis with you? 
RACHEL	f	No...we're going to be here awhile, and he wanted a few days to wind up our affairs there. I just wondered if he was with you. 
JUD	f	No--but if he drops by, I'll tell him to call you. 
RACHEL	f	Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? I don't-- 
RACHEL	f	Was it Pascow? 
JUD	f	Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to-- 
RACHEL	f	Don't bother. I'm coming home. Rachel! 
RACHEL	f	Thank you, Jud. Goodbye. 
JUD	f	No! Rachel! Don't do that! Rachel--! 
DORY	f	Rachel...darling...you're upset... a night's sleep... 
RACHEL	f	I have to go. The connections are  tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in  forty minutes. Will you drive me, daddy? 
IRWIN	m	You know something's wrong, don't you? You know. And Ellie does, too. 
RACHEL	f	Yes. 
IRWIN	m	I'll drive you. Mommy? 
ELLIE	f	Please hurry. 
RACHEL	f	I will. Come and kiss me. 
IRWIN	m	I'll come with you if you want, honey. I've got three planes to catch and I got the last seats on two of them. It's like God saved them for me. 
JUD	f	You done it, you stupid old man... now you got to undo it. 
SEATMATE	?	Think you'll make your connection in Boston? 
RACHEL	f	I have to. 
LOUIS	m	Oh, Gage--oh, honey. 
LOUIS	m	It's going to be all right...I swear it's going to be all right... 
COP	m	I ain't afraid of no ghost. 
PASCOW	?	There's just time. If you run. 
PASCOW	?	Don't do that, babe. 
RACHEL	f	Make it come back! 
FEMALE GATE AGENT	f	I can't-- 
PASCOW	?	You're doing just fine. 
LOUIS	m	Please God--let this work. 
LOUIS	m	Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't gonna look down. 
HERTZ CLERK	m	I'm sorry...it's been very busy tonight. I really don't have anything. 
PASCOW	?	What about the Aries K with the scratch on the side? 
CLERK	m	I do have an Aries K, but it came in sort of beat up--there's a long scrape up one side-- 
RACHEL	f	I'll take it. 
LOUIS	m	See? Just imagination. Just-- 
LOUIS	m	Nothing...there. 
LOUIS	m	It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I think the Wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me. 
LOUIS	m	It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage. 
RACHEL	f	Now what? 
PASCOW	?	It's trying to stop you. Do you hear me? It's trying to stop you. 
RACHEL	f	Is anyone there? 
LOUIS	m	Come back to me, Gage. Come back to us. 
DRIVER	m	Hop in, baby. 
RACHEL	f	Thank you. 
RACHEL	f	Can't you go any faster? 
TRUCKER	m	Lady, I got nine points on my license right now. 
RACHEL	f	I understand. It's just that-- 
RACHEL	f	Thank you. If you only understood how important this is-- 
TRUCKER	m	That's all right, babe. Only if we get stopped, next time I'll be the one hitchin' and you can give me a ride. 
JUD	f	Come on, stop playing games! 
JUD	f	Gage? (Pause) Are you the one playing games? 
JUD	f	Gage? Come on out. 
JUD	f	I want to show you something. 
RACHEL	f	Thank you so much. 
TRUCKER	m	I didn't get a ticket, so you're welcome, lady. Whatever your problems are, I hope they work out. 
PASCOW	?	It's the end of the line for me, too--I'm not allowed any further. I'm sure things will be fine. 
PASCOW	?	I'm not. Mummy! Mummy! 
RACHEL	f	Who-- 
CHURCH	m	Miaow! 
RACHEL	f	Church! Mummy, I need you! 
RACHEL	f	Gage? Gage? 
LOUIS	m	Jesus! 
LOUIS	m	Gage--? 
LOUIS	m	Oh my God. (Pause) Gage! 
LOUIS	m	Gage! 
LOUIS	m	Hello! Hello, Louis--it's Irwin. I just wanted to be sure Rachel got back all right. 
LOUIS	m	Yes, she's fine. Well, put her on at that end and I'll put Ellie on at this one. Ellie's very worried about her mother. (Pause) She's almost in hysterics. 
LOUIS	m	She...Rachel's asleep. Then I suggest you wake her up. Ellie...I think she had a dream that her mother was dead. 
LOUIS	m	I'll call you right back. Louis--! 
LOUIS	m	Irwin, you'll just have to-- I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come over and play with me? Gage? Mommy already came. We played, daddy. First I played with Jud and then mommy came and I played with mommy. We had an awful good time. Now I want to play with you. 
LOUIS	m	What did you do? What did you-- 
LOUIS	m	What you buy is what you own, and sooner or later what you own comes home to you. Wasn't that what you said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it? 
LOUIS	m	Hi, Church. Want some grub? 
LOUIS	m	Don't mind me. Eat it while you can. Eat all you want. 
LOUIS	m	Eat all you can...all you want... that's right...today's Thanksgiving day for cats, but only if they came back from the dead... 
LOUIS	m	No, you don't! 
LOUIS	m	Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead. 
LOUIS	m	Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause) Gage? 
LOUIS	m	Gage? 
LOUIS	m	All right, Gage...let's. 
LOUIS	m	I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm-- 
LOUIS	m	I'm going to set things back in order. I...I know just what to do. 
LOUIS	m	Gage? 
GAGE	m	No fair! NO FAIR! 
LOUIS	m	And what you own always comes home to you.
