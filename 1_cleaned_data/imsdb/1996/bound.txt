VIOLET 	f	I had this image of you, inside of  me, like a part of me.
CORKY 	m	You planned this whole thing, didn't  you?
CAESAR 	m	Where's the fucking money?
VIOLET 	f	We make our own choices, we pay our  own prices.
CAESAR 	m	All part of the business.
VIOLET 	f	All part of the business.
CORKY 	m	What choice?
VIOLET 	f	I want out.
VIOLET 	f	Like a part of me.
WOMAN	f	Wait!  Hold the elevator.
CORKY	m	Thanks again for this opportunity,  Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.
VIOLET	f	Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of  met in the elevator --
CORKY	m	Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
VIOLET	f	I heard you working in here and I  just wondered if you'd like a cup of  coffee?
CORKY	m	Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.
VIOLET	f	What happened to Rajeev?
CORKY	m	Who?
VIOLET	f	Rajeev, the man who usually works on  the building.
CORKY	m	Oh, he went home to India, but as  far as I know he'll be back.
VIOLET	f	So this is temporary for you?
CORKY	m	Pretty much.  One day at a time.
VIOLET	f	I guessed you were straight black.
CORKY	m	Good guess.
CORKY	m	Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
VIOLET	f	My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I  did have a slightly ulterior motive  here.  I was wondering if I could  ask a small favor?
CORKY	m	A favor?
VIOLET	f	Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person,  so I was wondering if it wasn't a  terrible inconvenience if you could  wait a bit before using power tools.
CORKY	m	Oh, I'm sorry --
VIOLET	f	No, it isn't your fault.  The walls  here are just so thin.
CORKY	m	Are they really?
VIOLET	f	Yes, it really causes problems.   Sometimes it's like you're in the  same room.  But if it's too much  trouble, I understand ...
CORKY	m	No, no trouble.  There's other work  to do.
VIOLET	f	You're doing everything yourself?
CORKY	m	Yeah.
VIOLET	f	That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of  people who can fix things.  My dad  was like that.  We never had anything  new.  Whenever something broke he  would open it up, tinker with it and  it would work.  His hands were magic.
VIOLET	f	Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty  years old.
CORKY	m	Truck.
VIOLET	f	Truck.  Of course.
CORKY	m	'63 Chevy.
VIOLET	f	I knew it.
VIOLET	f	So, how do you know the owner, Mr.  Bianchinni?
CORKY	m	I don't, really.  I was referred to  him.
VIOLET	f	Oh, really.
CORKY	m	Do you know him?
VIOLET	f	No, but Caesar does.  He likes him.   Says he's a good Italian.
CORKY	m	Caesar is your husband?
VIOLET	f	Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying  kind.
VIOLET	f	I should be going.  You can drop the  cup off anytime.
CORKY	m	Thanks.
VIOLET	f	My pleasure.
BARTENDER	m	Well, well ...
BARTENDER	m	Been awhile, Cork.
CORKY	m	Five years, two months, sixteen days.   How you doing, Sue?
SUE	f	Like shit.  Now that we're all caught  up, how about a drink?
CORKY	m	Thanks.
SUE	f	You got a job yet?
CORKY	m	Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and  shit.
SUE	f	I mean a J-O-B.  A real job.
CORKY	m	Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and  narrow.  I'm just here to get laid  or drunk and hopefully both.
CORKY	m	Thanks for the beer.
CORKY	m	Hi.
WOMAN	f	Hello.
CORKY	m	You know ...  that outfit would look  great on my bedroom floor.
WOMAN COP	f	Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here?
CORKY	m	Nothing ...  yet.
WOMAN COP	f	Who's this?
WOMAN COP	f	Wait, I know you.
CORKY	m	I don't think so.
WOMAN COP	f	I didn't know you were out.
CORKY	m	When you get tired of Cagney and  Lacey, come find me.
CORKY	m	Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...   yes, everything is going fine.  I  got the tub drain all cleaned out.
CORKY	m	What apartment?
CORKY	m	All right, all right, I guess I could  take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome,  goodbye.
VIOLET	f	Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would  call you.  God, you must think |I'm  a total nuisance.
CORKY	m	Not exactly.
VIOLET	f	I'm sorry, I usually would call  Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do  so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
CORKY	m	He said you lost something.
VIOLET	f	Yeah, come on in.
VIOLET	f	I was doing some dishes and just as  I pulled the stopper my earring fell  in.
VIOLET	f	It's one of my favorites.  That's  why I got upset.  I know it probably  seems ridiculous to you.
VIOLET	f	I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I  shouldn't have called...
CORKY	m	I told Bianchinni I would take a  look.  Is it that sink?
CORKY	m	Do you have a pot or a bucket?
VIOLET	f	Sure.
VIOLET	f	Did you find it?
VIOLET	f	I can't believe it!  You did it!
VIOLET	f	Thank you so much.  You have to let  me pay you something --
CORKY	m	No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do  it.  I did it.
VIOLET	f	If you won't take money, how about a  drink?  It's getting late.  You can't  work all night.
CORKY	m	Okay, one drink.
VIOLET	f	What do you want?
CORKY	m	A beer?
VIOLET	f	A beer.  Of course.
VIOLET	f	Sit down.
VIOLET	f	Thanks again.
VIOLET	f	You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make  you nervous, Corky?
CORKY	m	No.
VIOLET	f	Thirsty, maybe.
CORKY	m	Curious, maybe.
VIOLET	f	Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling  a bit curious myself right now.
VIOLET	f	That's a great tattoo.
VIOLET	f	Beautiful labrys.
VIOLET	f	Are you surprised that I know what  it is?
CORKY	m	Maybe.
VIOLET	f	I have a tattoo, would you like to  see it?
VIOLET	f	A woman in upstate New York did it  for me.
VIOLET	f	Here.  Do you like it?
VIOLET	f	It took her all day to do it.  She  promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it  was sore for a long time after.  I  couldn't even touch it.
VIOLET	f	But now I love the way it feels.
VIOLET	f	Here, touch it.
CORKY	m	What are you doing?
VIOLET	f	Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to  seduce you.
CORKY	m	Why?
VIOLET	f	Because I want to.  I've wanted to  since I first saw you in the elevator.
VIOLET	f	You don't believe me.  But I can  prove it to you.
VIOLET	f	You can't believe me because of what  you see ...
VIOLET	f	But you can believe what you feel.
VIOLET	f	You see ...  I've been thinking about  you all day.
CORKY	m	You planned this whole thing?
CORKY	m	You dropped that earring down the  drain on purpose, didn't you?
VIOLET	f	If I say yes, will you take your  hand away?
CORKY	m	No.
VIOLET	f	...  yes.
VIOLET	f	Please, Corky ...  please ...
VIOLET	f	...  kiss me.
CAESAR	m	Violet?
CAESAR	m	Violet, you home?
VIOLET	f	Yeah.  In here, C.
CAESAR	m	What's this?
CAESAR	m	What the fuck is this?
VIOLET	f	I didn't expect --
CAESAR	m	What the fuck is going on?
CAESAR	m	Oh, shit ...
VIOLET	f	Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
CAESAR	m	I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...   it's fucking dark in here.
VIOLET	f	She is working for Bianchinni.
CAESAR	m	Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned  that to me.  Hi, welcome to the  family.
CAESAR	m	You're helping Rajeev?
CORKY	m	No.  Rajeev's in India.
VIOLET	f	She's doing the work herself.
CAESAR	m	No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You  know he's a good friend of mine.   |Family, really.
CORKY	m	That's what Violet said.
CAESAR	m	So, you just got out?
VIOLET	f	Jesus, Caesar!
CAESAR	m	What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal.   I know who Don hires.  Did you know  he did time himself?
CAESAR	m	Thirteen fucking years.  See, there  ain't no secrets here.
CAESAR	m	How many'd you do?
CORKY	m	Five.
CAESAR	m	Not bad.  What for?
VIOLET	f	That's none of your goddamn business,  Caesar.
CAESAR	m	You're right.  You don't have to  tell me, if you don't want to.  I  just hope you understand you're among  good people here.
CAESAR	m	Come on, come on.  if you understand  what I'm talking about you're going  to take the money.  if you don't,  I'm going to have to worry about  you.
CAESAR	m	Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.
CORKY	m	I should be going.
CAESAR	m	What?  How about a drink?
CORKY	m	My brushes, I have to clean my  brushes.  Thanks, though.
CAESAR	m	Another time.
CORKY	m	Sure.
CORKY	m	What are you doing?
CORKY	m	What am I doing?  I'm fucking up,  that's what I'm doing.
VIOLET	f	I had to see you.
CORKY	m	Look, I don't think this is a good  idea.
VIOLET	f	I wanted to apologize.
CORKY	m	Don't apologize, please.  I can't  stand women who apologize for wanting  sex.
VIOLET	f	I'm not apologizing for what I did --
VIOLET	f	I'm apologizing for what I didn't  do.
VIOLET	f	Do you have a bed somewhere?
CORKY	m	I can see again.
VIOLET	f	...  I needed that.
CORKY	m	Tell me about it.
CORKY	m	Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
VIOLET	f	You have to ask?
CORKY	m	No.
VIOLET	f	Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.   Caesar calls it "The |Business."
CORKY	m	How did you meet him?
VIOLET	f	They took over a club I was working  at.  Caesar started managing it.
CORKY	m	He's a launderer?
VIOLET	f	Basically.
CORKY	m	How long have you been with him?
VIOLET	f	Almost five years.
CORKY	m	Five years is a long time.
VIOLET	f	Yes, it is.
CORKY	m	The redistribution of wealth.
VIOLET	f	What?
CORKY	m	Isn't that what you wanted to know?   What I did time for?
VIOLET	f	The redistribution of wealth?
CORKY	m	That's what I tell someone when I'm  trying to get them in my bed.
VIOLET	f	I'm already in your bed.
CORKY	m	My cellmate would say she did her  time for getting caught.  She was  always more honest than me.
CORKY	m	I started stealing when I was little.   We were piss-poor, which is not an  excuse, just a fact.
CORKY	m	The first time I remember so vividly.   A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's  Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was  a mean old prick, always worrying  about us robbing him, dropped a roll  of quarters.
CORKY	m	I can still hear that sound, those  quarters, because right then something  clicked inside of me.  Some instinct  took over and as everyone, including  Waxman, dove down, I reached up and  emptied the cash register.
CORKY	m	I gave most of the money to my mom.   I told her I found it at the  trainyard.  She was so happy she  cried, calling me her lucky charm.   Fifteen years later, I guess my luck  ran out.
CORKY	m	Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't  have a choice, that stealing was  surviving.  Usually I can admit that's  bullshit.  I did it because it was a  way out.  It was easy and I was good  at it, real good.
CORKY	m	I don't usually talk this much.  I  guess I have been rehabilitated.
VIOLET	f	You didn't have to tell me if you  didn't want to.
CORKY	m	I guess I wanted to.
VIOLET	f	I'm glad you did.
CORKY	m	So am I.
SHELLY	f	I know he's gone.  Please.  I have  to talk to you.
VIOLET 	f	What do you want, Shelly?
VIOLET	f	I had this image of you, inside of  me ...
VIOLET	f	Like a part of me ...
VIOLET	f	You are so beautiful.
VIOLET	f	What's wrong?
CORKY	m	Nothing.
VIOLET	f	Yes there is.  I felt it this morning  when I brought you the coffee.
CORKY	m	Shit, here we go.
VIOLET	f	You didn't want to see me, did you?
CORKY	m	If there is one thing I can't stand  about sleeping with women, it's all  the fucking mind reading.
VIOLET	f	What are you afraid of?
CORKY	m	I'm not afraid of anything.
VIOLET	f	I don't understand - ?
CORKY	m	I know!  You can't understand, because  we're different, Violet.  We're  different.
VIOLET	f	We're not that different, Corky.
CORKY	m	How can you sit in that bed and say  that?
VIOLET	f	Because it's the truth.
CORKY	m	Let me guess.  This is where you  tell me that what matters is on the  inside.  That inside you, there is a  little dyke just like me?
VIOLET	f	Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's  a lot smarter than you.
CORKY	m	Is that what her daddy tells her?
VIOLET	f	I know what I am.  I don't need to  have it tattooed on my shoulder.
CORKY	m	What are you saying?  That you don't  have sex with men?
VIOLET	f	I don't.
CORKY	m	For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard  you!  Thin walls, remember?
VIOLET	f	What you heard wasn't sex.
CORKY	m	What the fuck was it?
VIOLET	f	All my life, everyone has been telling  me that when I have sex, I'm not  really having sex.  Not real sex.   But they're wrong.  I know what is  and isn't sex and what you heard was  definitely not sex.
CORKY	m	What was it then?
VIOLET	f	Work.
VIOLET	f	You made certain choices in your  life that you paid for.  You said  you made them because you were good  at something and it was easy.  Do  you think you're the only one that's  good at something?
VIOLET	f	We make our own choices and we pay  our own prices.  I think we're more  alike than you want to admit.
CORKY	m	What about that guy this morning?
VIOLET	f	You mean Shelly?
CORKY	m	Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
VIOLET	f	No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw  me in a bar with another woman.
CORKY	m	I suppose he just wants to watch.
VIOLET	f	Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
CORKY	m	I think so, too.
VIOLET	f	Try not to steal anything on the way  out.
CORKY	m	Shit.
ANGRY VOICE	m	Shut the fuck up!  You piece of shit!
ANGRY VOICE	m	You're going to tell us!  You're  going to fuckin' tell us!  just a  matter of fuckin' time!
ANGRY VOICE	m	Where is it?  Where the fuck is it?!
ANGRY VOICE	m	You shit!  You piece of shit!
ANGRY VOICE	m	Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko:  I'm just getting started.
JOHNNIE	m	You got nerve trying to fuck us!   Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my  father!  Nobody!  Nobody!
CAESAR	m	Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making  too much noise.
JOHNNIE	m	You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
CAESAR	m	Here, put this in his mouth.
JOHNNIE	m	Prick!  I can go all night!  All  night!
VIOLET	f	Caesar, I'm leaving.
CAESAR	m	What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one  of the good towels.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too  much.  I have to get out of here.
CAESAR	m	Why?  'Cause you know him?
CAESAR	m	You women are so fucking sensitive.
CAESAR	m	But I don't want you to go.  I like  you here.  You know this isn't easy  for me, either.
CAESAR	m	Now why don't you go watch some TV  or something?
MICKEY	m	Are you okay, Violet?
CAESAR	m	Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You  know how I feel about that fucking  psycho.
MICKEY	m	Caesar, didn't I tell you to get  something?
CAESAR	m	Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
MICKEY	m	You shouldn't have to see this.  Why  don't you get out of here?  Go for a  walk.
VIOLET	f	Caesar wants me to stay.
MICKEY	m	Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle  Caesar.  You just get out of here,  okay?
VIOLET	f	Thanks, Mickey.
MICKEY	m	Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing.
MICKEY	m	Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.
JOHNNIE	m	Prick.
MICKEY	m	Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten  times.  You understand?  Ten times.
MICKEY	m	One.  Where is our money?
CAESAR	m	Aw ...  Christ.
CORKY	m	Violet?  Are you all right?
CORKY	m	Come on.  Let's go.
CORKY	m	Excuse me.
CORKY	m	Draft beer and a TNT.
VIOLET	f	Shelly was skimming from the business.   He came to see me yesterday because  he was afraid Caesar figured it out.   He wanted to run but he wanted me to  come with him.
CORKY	m	Even though he knew about you?
VIOLET	f	Yes.
CORKY	m	He was in love with you, right?
VIOLET	f	That's what he told himself.  But it  wasn't even about me, it was about  Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.   That's how they are.  I understand  them.
VIOLET	f	For Shelly, taking the money was a  way to take from Caesar.  He could  have run at any time, but he didn't  because he didn't want out.
CORKY	m	Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
VIOLET	f	Maybe he did.  He would brag to me  all the time.  He was never afraid  of Caesar because he didn't know  him.  Not like I do.
VIOLET	f	Caesar lives for these moments.  He  tells me it's just the business, but  I know it's more than that.  He likes  it.  The violence.  I'll catch him  in the bathroom mirror touching his  scars.  He says they remind him who  he his.  They're all like that.   Except maybe Mickey.
CORKY	m	Mickey?
VIOLET	f	He's the part of the business that  the rest of them pretend to be.   |But Mickey doesn't like it like  they do.  I suppose that's why he's  good at it.
VIOLET	f	I used to be able to block it out.   I would tell myself that I wasn't  really there so nothing really  mattered.  But I can't do it anymore.
VIOLET	f	I've been making the same mistake  Shelly made.  But now I know what |I  want.
VIOLET	f	I want out.  I want a new life.  I  see what I've been waiting for, but  I need you, Corky.
CORKY	m	For what?
VIOLET	f	You made a choice once.  Do you think  you would make that same choice again?
CORKY	m	What choice?
VIOLET	f	If those quarters fell to the floor,  would you still reach up to that  cash register?
CORKY	m	Not here.
VIOLET	f	Caesar is going to get the money and  bring --
CORKY	m	How much money?
VIOLET	f	Shelly said it was over two million  dollars.
VIOLET	f	Caesar will bring it to the apartment  to count and go through |Shelly's  books to figure out how he did it.
CORKY	m	Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do  you have any idea what you are saying?   You are asking me to help you fuck  the mob.
CORKY	m	These people are serious, Violet.   If you want to know how serious, ask  Shelly.  They're worse than any cop  because they have lots of money and  no rules.  You fuck them, you've got  to do it right.
VIOLET	f	That's why I need your help.  You  said you were good.
CORKY	m	I am, but ...
CORKY	m	All right, let's say for the moment  that I believe everything you are  saying.
VIOLET	f	You think I'm lying?
CORKY	m	I didn't say that, but since you  did, let's say that you are.  It  would have been easy to set Shelly  up.  You could have got him killed  knowing that Caesar would bring the  money to the apartment.
CORKY	m	All you would need to keep yourself  clean would be someone unconnected,  someone like me.
VIOLET	f	Is that what you think?
CORKY	m	I'm just making a point.  You have  no idea what you're asking.  How  much trust two people need to do  something like this.
CORKY	m	For me, stealing is a lot like sex.   Two people that want the same thing  sit in a room and they talk, they  start to plan and it's like flirting,  a kind of foreplay, because the more  they talk about it, the wetter they  get.
CORKY	m	The difference is, I can have sex  with someone I just met, someone I  hardly know, but to steal I need to  know someone like I know myself.
VIOLET	f	Do you think you know me like that?
CORKY	m	I think ...
CORKY	m	We're going to find out.
CORKY	m	But first, I want to see this money.
VIOLET	f	Oh my God ...
CAESAR	m	Don't worry.  It ain't mine.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, what happened?
CAESAR	m	It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
CAESAR	m	Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's  ruined!
CAESAR	m	It started when Shelly took us to  the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato  knows his shit, he does.  Shelly  takes us right there.
CAESAR	m	So Shelly's down on his knees and  he's pulling out this bag of money  from a safe in the floor and I'm  staring at it like "holy fuck!" I  mean, look at it --
CAESAR	m	And all I can think is how the fuck  did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie  caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere,  all over the money.  We've no idea  if this is even all of it.
CAESAR	m	And right then I go through the roof  and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as  hard as I can.  I didn't care whose  son he was, I just wanted to hit him  again.  Knock some sense into that  dumb son of a bitch.
CAESAR	m	Just look at this mess I got to deal  with.
VIOLET	f	What are you going to do with it?
CAESAR	m	I told them to run it through the  cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans  for it because he's coming here  tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
CAESAR	m	Where the hell's the laundry  detergent?
VIOLET	f	Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
CORKY	m	Come to my place in the morning.   Early, okay?
VIOLET 	f	You're having second thoughts.
CORKY	m	...  no.
CORKY	m	You said he washed the money?
VIOLET	f	Yeah.
CORKY	m	Then what?  Exactly.
VIOLET	f	He hung it up.
CORKY	m	What?
VIOLET	f	To let it dry.
VIOLET	f	It was unreal ...
VIOLET 	f	Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere  like leaves.
VIOLET 	f	Then one by one, he ironed all of  it.
CORKY 	m	Did he sleep?
VIOLET 	f	No.  But neither did I.
VIOLET 	f	All night long I listened to that  sound.
CORKY 	m	What sound?
VIOLET 	f	The sound of money.
CORKY	m	And where is it now?
VIOLET	f	In his office.  I saw it this morning.
VIOLET	f	I need to go to the store.
VIOLET 	f	It's in a case, on his desk.
CORKY 	m	Does the case lock?
VIOLET	f	Yes.
CORKY	m	Good.
CORKY	m	All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
VIOLET	f	Johnnie?
CORKY	m	It sounded like he and Caesar don't  like each other.
VIOLET	f	Like each other?  They hate each  other.
CORKY	m	Why?
VIOLET	f	It started way before I was around.   I think basically it's because he  thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.   But Johnnie runs Chicago because  Gino is his father.
CORKY	m	Who is Gino?
VIOLET	f	Gino Marzzone.
CORKY	m	Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone,  head of the Marzzone family?
VIOLET	f	That's his brother.
CORKY	m	...  shit.
CORKY	m	Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to  pick up the money?
VIOLET	f	Yeah.
CORKY	m	And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie  Marzzone?
VIOLET	f	Yeah.
CORKY	m	Sweet Jesus.
CORKY	m	It's perfect.
CORKY	m	Gino Marzzone is coming to your  apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't  it?  That means Caesar will be ready.   He doesn't want to look like an idiot.   Gino has been there before?
VIOLET	f	Yeah, twice.
CORKY	m	What happened?
VIOLET	f	Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous,  kept cleaning the apartment.  |The  first time, he picked out the dress  he wanted me to wear.
CORKY	m	Does Johnnie hit on you?
VIOLET	f	Johnnie hits on anything in high  heels.
CORKY	m	Has Caesar ever seen him?
VIOLET	f	He does it right in front of him.
CORKY	m	It's getting better and better.   Keep going.
VIOLET	f	Gino doesn't know English, or at  least he pretends he doesn't, so he  doesn't talk much.  He gets right to  the point.  Both times they talked  for about five minutes, had one drink  and then they left.
CORKY	m	What did Gino drink?
VIOLET	f	Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that  Caesar made a huge deal about it.
CORKY	m	All right ...
CORKY	m	I have an idea to make this work.
CORKY 	m	You'll go back and get ready, take  your time, make it real.
CORKY 	m	The more attractive you are, the  more believable it will be.
CORKY	m	What time did you say they would be  there?
VIOLET	f	The plane is in at seven, so I'd say  about eight.
CORKY	m	Any bodyguards?
VIOLET	f	Gino travels with a big man named  Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
CORKY	m	Fine.
CORKY 	m	At some point Caesar is going to  quit.  I'd guess sometime around  six, making sure he's got time to  get ready.
CAESAR	m	Un-fucking-believable, what this guy  did.  Shelly is one smart-ass  mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart- ass motherfucker.
CORKY 	m	As soon as he is done, you'll be  right there to put a big drink in  his hand.
CORKY 	m	We want him to come down, to relax,  feel in control again.
VIOLET	f	Poor boy, has to work so hard.
CAESAR	m	You look good enough to eat.
VIOLET	f	Where will you be?
CORKY	m	Waiting in the apartment next door.
VIOLET 	f	Waiting for what?
CORKY 	m	For the shower.  That will be our  signal.
CORKY 	m	When he's done with his shower, you  will go to the bar.
CORKY 	m	You'll get out the Scotch that Gino  drinks.
CORKY 	m	And as you do, the bottle will slip  from your hands.  -- and shatter  against the hardwood floor.
CORKY 	m	An accident.
VIOLET	f	Shit!  Oh shit!
CAESAR 	m	What happened?!
CAESAR 	m	V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet?
CAESAR	m	V, what?  You can't hear me?
VIOLET	f	Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying  to get ready ...
CAESAR	m	Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be  kidding me!
CAESAR	m	Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww  goddammit!
VIOLET	f	I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
VIOLET	f	Don't worry, I'll get some more.
CAESAR	m	There's no time.
VIOLET	f	Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take  five minutes.
VIOLET	f	I'll clean this up and be back before  you're even dressed.
CORKY 	m	When you open the door, I'll be there.
VIOLET 	f	What if he sees you?
CORKY 	m	He won't.
VIOLET	f	You can't know for certain that he  won't see you.
CORKY	m	Trust me, Violet.
VIOLET	f	I'm just asking, what if?
CORKY	m	If he does ...
CORKY	m	Then I won't have a choice, will I?
CORKY 	m	When I'm inside, I will get the money.
CORKY 	m	I'm going to need something ...
CORKY 	m	...  to fill the case.
CORKY 	m	Yeah, you should hide it near the  desk before you leave.
CORKY 	m	At that point --
CORKY	m	There is no going back.
VIOLET	f	When I get the Scotch, how do I know  you won't take off?
CORKY	m	The same way I'll know that you went  to Scotch.  Trust.
VIOLET	f	I still don't see how I'm going to  get clean with the money in the  apartment.  Everyone will think I  did it.
CORKY	m	Not Caesar.
VIOLET	f	Why?
CORKY	m	Because of what you are going to  tell him.  You have to make it as  real as you can.  The moment you  open the door with the Scotch in  your hand, you will be covered, and  that moment is the most important  moment in the plan.
CORKY 	m	If it's real enough, he'll believe  it, because deep down he'll want to.
VIOLET	f	C!  Shit, I'm sorry!
VIOLET	f	They were early.
CAESAR	m	What are you talking about?
VIOLET	f	They just left, didn't they?
CAESAR	m	What are you, drunk?
VIOLET	f	You mean they weren't up here?
CAESAR	m	No!  They're still on their way.
VIOLET	f	That doesn't make any sense.
CAESAR	m	Why?
VIOLET	f	Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
CAESAR	m	What?
VIOLET	f	I was getting out of the car when I  saw him in the Mercedes.
CAESAR	m	It couldn't have been.
VIOLET	f	It was him.  I'm positive.
CAESAR	m	It's impossible!
VIOLET	f	Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him.   I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't  believe I missed them.  I knew you  were going to be upset so I thought  I'd apologize and give Gino the  Scotch.  I honked a couple of times  but he didn't stop.
CAESAR	m	But Gino's plane doesn't get in for  another half-hour.
VIOLET	f	Actually, I didn't see Gino in the  car.
CORKY	m	If Caesar hates Johnnie like you  say, then the second he opens the  case he'll know, in his gut, that  Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll  realize that he has no choice.  He  can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's  only one way out.
CORKY	m	He'll have to run.
VIOLET	f	If he runs, everyone will assume he  took the money.
CORKY	m	You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
VIOLET	f	Jesus, that's beautiful.
CORKY	m	Thank you.
VIOLET	f	If you're this goddamn smart, how  did you ever get caught?
CORKY	m	Every job like this has moments where  things don't go so well and everyone  starts thinking about their own ass.   It's in those moments that everything  comes together or falls apart.
CORKY	m	I had a partner and she fucked me.
VIOLET	f	I won't.
CORKY	m	I think we're going to find out.
VIOLET	f	Caesar?
CAESAR	m	No no no no ...
VIOLET	f	Oh God ...
CAESAR	m	...  I've been set up.
VIOLET	f	Johnnie?
CAESAR	m	That fuck!  That rat-fuck!  Little  shit rat-fuck!
VIOLET	f	Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?
CAESAR	m	Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your  fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like  I hate him!
CAESAR	m	I hate that little fuck!  I hate  him!  I hate him!  I should've done  him!
VIOLET	f	But you know he did it.
CAESAR	m	So what?!  So fucking what?  Use  your head, Violet.  The money is  gone.  Gino is coming here to get  it.  You think he's going to believe  me if I tell him his piss-hole son  stole it!  Is that what you think?   I don't.  You know what I think?  I  think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in  the brain.  That's what I think!
VIOLET	f	Caesar, what are we going to do?
CAESAR	m	I know what he wants me to do.  He  wants me out of here.  He wants me  to run.
CAESAR	m	If I run, then everyone will think I  took the money and he walks away  with two million clean.
CAESAR	m	God, I can see him right now driving  to get Gino.  I can hear him laughing,  fucking laughing, laughing at me.
CAESAR	m	Laughing at me!  Laughing at me!
VIOLET	f	C ...
CAESAR	m	Don't touch me!
CAESAR	m	Just leave me alone!  I got to think!
CAESAR	m	Got to think this through ...
VIOLET	f	Caesar, maybe we should run --
CAESAR	m	Violet, please!
VIOLET	f	I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie,  forget the money, let's just go now,  before it's too late --
CAESAR	m	Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just  leave me the fuck alone!  Please!   Leave!  Now!
VIOLET	f	All right, Caesar.
VIOLET 	f	It's me.
CORKY	m	What happened?
VIOLET	f	He totally freaked.  I've never seen  him like this.  He's out of his  fucking mind.
CORKY 	m	That's okay, as long as he believes  it was Johnnie.
VIOLET	f	Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving  him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I  don't know, Corky, I don't know what  he is going to do.  I'm getting  nervous, really nervous.
CORKY	m	It's all right, Violet.  It's working.   All we got to do is wait him out and  see what he does.
VIOLET 	f	What if he doesn't run?
CORKY	m	That means he probably will kill  Johnnie.
VIOLET 	f	Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
CORKY	m	Listen, if he doesn't run, all you  have to do is break down, go to your  bedroom and pack some things, start  crying, saying you love him but you  can't do it.  You're sorry but you  have to leave and just walk out.
VIOLET	f	okay, all right.
CORKY 	m	We're almost there, Violet.  just  hang on.
VIOLET	f	He's coming ...
CAESAR	m	I got it!  I know what I got to do!   I got to get the money.
VIOLET	f	The money?  The money's gone.
CAESAR	m	No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to  do is get it back.
VIOLET	f	But it could be anywhere.
CAESAR	m	He didn't have that much time.  He  had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's  got it with him.  I bet it's in the  car.
CAESAR	m	He didn't see you, did he?
VIOLET	f	No.
CAESAR	m	See, right now he doesn't know that  I know, that's why he put the paper  in the case.  He wants me to hand  the case to Gino.  Then there is no  doubt it was me.  Gino will put a  bullet in me himself.  But it ain't  going to happen.  I won't let it!   Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not  like this!  No way!
VIOLET	f	This is insane!
CAESAR	m	What are you doing?
VIOLET	f	I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't  want to be involved.  I don't want  anything to do with this shit!
CAESAR	m	You can't leave.
VIOLET	f	The hell I can't!
CAESAR	m	I need you ...
VIOLET	f	Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've  never needed me!  I can't help you!   Understand?!  I have to get out.
CAESAR	m	Violet, I won't let you leave.
CAESAR	m	If you're not with me, Violet, then  I have to assume you're against me.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, this is crazy.
CAESAR	m	Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe  you dropped the Scotch by accident.   Maybe you didn't.
CAESAR	m	It would have been so easy to let  him in as you went out.
VIOLET	f	You don't, you can't believe that
CAESAR	m	I've seen the way he looks at you.   He's always wanted you.  Maybe two  million dollars finally bought you.
CAESAR	m	I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be  this way.
CAESAR	m	I hope you understand.  I want to  trust you, I want to believe you,  but I don't have any other choice.
CAESAR	m	You sure you don't want a drink?
JOHNNIE	m	You shouldn't have hit me.
CAESAR	m	You want to get into this now?
JOHNNIE	m	No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
GINO	m	Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this  girl, or I find out!
JOHNNIE	m	You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
CAESAR	m	Glenlivet, right, Gino?
JOHNNIE	m	I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
VIOLET	f	I'm not drinking.
JOHNNIE	m	Then neither will I.
VIOLET	f	No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.
JOHNNIE	m	Caesar, make that two TNTs.
JOHNNIE	m	Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.
GINO	m	No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones.   Not now.
JOHNNIE	m	Pop?
GINO	m	Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk  now.  You too, Johnnie.
GINO	m	Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me  what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do  me a favor, a personal favor.  For  me, eh?  You gotta start respecting  Johnnie the way you respect me.  You  understand?  Good.
GINO	m	And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop  acting stupid.  You gotta earn this  respect that Caesar's gonna give.   You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now,  where's my money?
GINO	m	We know how this was done, eh?
CAESAR	m	Yeah, I know.
GINO	m	It won't happen again, eh?
GINO	m	Good.
GINO	m	Done.  We go now.
JOHNNIE	m	Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours  until your plane leaves.
GINO	m	Caesar!
JOHNNIE	m	So Caesar, what did it total out at?
CAESAR	m	Two point one seventy-six.
JOHNNIE	m	Unbelievable.  Can you believe that,  Violet?
GINO	m	Hey, Johnnie ...
JOHNNIE	m	Come on, Pop, all I want to know is  one thing.  Just one thing after he  made such a big deal out of it.  I  bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it,  Caesar?
CAESAR	m	What's that, Johnnie?
JOHNNIE	m	The money I bet it was nothing to  get it clean, after you made such a  fucking big deal ...
GINO	m	Johnnie, what did I say?
JOHNNIE	m	Pop, this is important to me.  It's  a simple question.  if he would just  answer the question, that's the end  of it.
CAESAR	m	Where is this going, Johnnie?
JOHNNIE	m	Just admit it, Caesar.
CAESAR	m	Admit what?
JOHNNIE	m	That you overreacted.  That you lost  it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
CAESAR	m	All right, Johnnie, you want to play  it this way, I can play it this way.   You want to know who made a mistake,  why don't you open the case.
VIOLET	f	Caesar ...
CAESAR	m	Shut up, Violet!  This is between me  and Johnnie.
CAESAR	m	You want to do this now, let's do  it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking  case.
CAESAR	m	That's right, I know.  I fucking  know.
JOHNNIE	m	Know what?
CAESAR	m	Open the case!
JOHNNIE	m	All right!  Where's the key?
CAESAR	m	You don't need a key.
JOHNNIE	m	How the fuck can I open it?
CAESAR	m	The same way you did before.
JOHNNIE	m	What are you talking about?
CAESAR	m	There you go, Johnnie.
CAESAR	m	Get me another.
JOHNNIE	m	What the ...
CAESAR	m	Don't!  Don't fucking move!
GINO	m	Caesar?  What is this?
CAESAR	m	Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
JOHNNIE	m	What the fuck?
CAESAR	m	You don't think I'll do it, do you?
JOHNNIE	m	I think you're fucking crazy!
CAESAR	m	Where is it?
JOHNNIE	m	Where's what?
CAESAR	m	The money!
JOHNNIE	m	Caesar, I don't know what you're  thinking here, but if you don't put  down that gun --
CAESAR	m	Sit down!
GINO	m	Caesar!
CAESAR	m	Gino, your son stole this money to  set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
CAESAR	m	Tell them!  Tell them!
VIOLET	f	For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what  he says.
JOHNNIE	m	This isn't happening ...
CAESAR	m	The next one blows off your dick.
JOHNNIE	m	You're a dead man!  A fucking dead  man!
CAESAR	m	Where is it?
GINO	m	Enough!
CAESAR	m	No, Gino!
GINO	m	You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know  who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You  understand?
CAESAR	m	Sit down, Gino!
GINO	m	No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
CAESAR	m	Stay away!
GINO	m	We're family, Caesar.
CAESAR	m	No!
GINO	m	Gimme the gun.
CAESAR	m	I can't.  I can't.
GINO	m	Give it to me.
GINO	m	Good man.
CORKY	m	This is an emergency!
CAESAR	m	I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.   I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.   That lying fuck.  He made me do it.
CAESAR	m	You lying rat-fuck.  You think you  can set me up?  Is that what you  think?  You stupid fuck.
CAESAR	m	I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man?   Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead?   Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take  another guess, take another fucking  guess!
VIOLET	f	What are you doing?
CAESAR	m	...  maybe three hours.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, what are you going to do?
CAESAR	m	What do you think we're going to do?   We have to find the money.
VIOLET	f	What?
CAESAR	m	Once we have the money, then none of  this ever happened.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
CAESAR	m	No I didn't.  Not if his body  disappears and not if the money is  still here.  Then they never showed  up.
VIOLET	f	What happened to them?
CAESAR	m	I don't know.  We may never know,  but I'm going to guess it was a job,  maybe the Karpoli family.
CAESAR	m	All part of the business.
CAESAR	m	We just got to find the money.  Once  we do, everything is going to be all  right.
VIOLET	f	Oh, no.
CAESAR	m	Fuck.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, what are we going to do?
CAESAR	m	They're just cops.  Stall them as  long as you can.
CAESAR	m	Answer it!
VIOLET	f	Hello?
COP #1 	m	This is the police, ma'am.
VIOLET	f	The police?
COP #1 	m	We had a report of gunfire, so if  you could --
VIOLET	f	Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
COP #1 	m	No joke, ma'am.  Please open the  door.
VIOLET	f	How do I know you are cops?
COP #1 	m	Ma'am, you have to open the door.
VIOLET	f	All right.
CAESAR	m	Get me a wet towel.
CAESAR	m	If you're thinking about doing  something stupid, remember I just  killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand  what that means?
VIOLET	f	They're just cops.
COP #1	m	See?  We're for real.
VIOLET	f	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
COP #1	m	You did the right thing.
CAESAR	m	Hey, hey, Chicago's finest.
CAESAR	m	How's it going tonight, fellas?
COP #1	m	Pretty good, sir.
CAESAR	m	Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in  this ear.
CAESAR	m	I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet.
CAESAR	m	Violet said something about gunshots?
COP #2	m	Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building  called in.
COP #1	m	I think we know what happened.
COP #2	m	It was probably just the television.
CAESAR	m	The television?
CAESAR	m	Honey, why didn't you say something?   Turn it off.
CAESAR	m	Fuck, this happened before.  It's  this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The  batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm  sorry.
COP #1	m	It's all right, sir.
COP #2	m	No big deal.
CAESAR	m	Hey, can I get you guys a beer?
COP #1	m	Not on duty, sorry.
CAESAR	m	Oh, right.
COP #2	m	But, uh, would you mind if I used  your bathroom?
CAESAR	m	Yeah, why not?  It's right there.
COP #2	m	Thanks.
CAESAR	m	I'm going to make myself a drink, if  that's okay?
COP #1	m	Go right ahead, sir.
COP #1	m	This is a beautiful place.
VIOLET	f	...  thank you.
COP #1	m	Is this a condo?
COP #2	m	Okay, let's roll.
COP #1	m	Try to keep the extra batteries for  your aid around.
CAESAR	m	Good idea.
CAESAR	m	Let's go.
CORKY	m	...  shit.
CAESAR	m	Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!
VIOLET	f	Caesar, someone could see us out  here.
CAESAR	m	Get in.
CAESAR	m	Get in!  It's got to be at his house.   That's the only other place it could  be.
CAESAR	m	Violet!  Now!
CORKY	m	Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two  million dollars ...
CAESAR	m	Okay, I come in ...
CAESAR	m	I've got the money ...
CAESAR	m	I can't wait to see the look on  Caesar's face when he finds out.
CAESAR	m	Now I don't have much time ...
CAESAR	m	Got to put it someplace safe ...
CAESAR	m	...  put it ...
CAESAR	m	...  got it ...
VIOLET	f	C?
CAESAR	m	Where did I put it?
CAESAR	m	Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking  cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?!
CAESAR	m	Ow.
VIOLET	f	C?
VIOLET	f	It's not here, Caesar.
CAESAR	m	Where, then?
VIOLET	f	I don't know.  it could be anywhere.   We don't even know if he was alone.   Please, Caesar, we don't have much  time.  Let's get out of here.
VIOLET	f	What are you doing?
CAESAR	m	We're going to need some time.
VIOLET	f	Who are you going to call?
VIOLET	f	Caesar?
MICKEY 	m	Yeah?
CAESAR	m	Hey, Mickey.
VIOLET	f	Oh, God.
MICKEY 	m	Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
CAESAR	m	Mick, I know it's late, but there is  a problem.  They haven't shown up  yet.
MICKEY 	m	What?  They ain't there?
CAESAR	m	No.  I don't know where they are.  I  even called over at Johnnie's, but  no answer.
MICKEY 	m	Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see  what I can do.  Don't go anywhere,  okay?
CAESAR	m	Okay, sure, Mick.
MICKEY 	m	Caesar, you still got the money?
CAESAR	m	Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.   I'm staring right at it.
MICKEY 	m	Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.
VIOLET	f	I'll start packing.  You know what  you have to do.
CAESAR	m	I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in  Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic  bags ...  tape and rope ...
VIOLET	f	Just hurry.
VIOLET	f	Please, Corky ...
VIOLET	f	Oh, thank God.
CORKY	m	I'm still here.
VIOLET	f	I was so afraid you ...
CORKY	m	You don't quit on me, Violet, and I  won't quit on you.
VIOLET	f	Corky, it worked!  He's going to  run.  He needs to take care of the  bodies to buy himself time, but as  soon as he leaves, it's over.
VIOLET 	f	just a little longer and it's ours.
VIOLET	f	Corky, I have to tell you something
CORKY	m	I know, Violet.  I know.
CORKY	m	It's why I'm still here.
CAESAR 	m	Violet?
CAESAR	m	Who was that?
CAESAR	m	Who the fuck was that?
CAESAR	m	Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?   Did you?!
CAESAR	m	Mickey?  Is that you?
CAESAR	m	Who is that?  Who is over there?!   Tell me!
VIOLET	f	Run!  Just run!
CAESAR	m	Drop the fucking gun or die!
CAESAR	m	Drop it!
CAESAR	m	Turn around.
CAESAR	m	You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You  gotta be kidding me!
CESAR 	m	Wake up!  Come on, you fucking dyke!
CAESAR 	m	Wake up!
CAESAR	m	Good.
CAESAR	m	I know everything now so I don't  want to hear any "I don't know"  bullshit, you understand?
CAESAR	m	God, I should have seen this coming!   The second I met you, I knew it.   Everyone knows your kind can't be  trusted!  Fucking queers make me  sick.
CAESAR	m	But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.   And I swear to you that I'm going to  kill you for it.
CAESAR	m	Where is the money?
VIOLET	f	Don't tell him --
CAESAR	m	Shut up, Violet!
VIOLET	f	He can't kill you --
CAESAR	m	Violet!
VIOLET	f	Not until he has the money!
CAESAR	m	Now, where the fuck is my money?
CORKY	m	Lick me.
CAESAR	m	Where is it?
CORKY	m	Either pull the trigger or get that  thing out of my face.
CAESAR	m	Stupid cunt!
VIOLET	f	Caesar, stop acting like an asshole  and think --
CAESAR	m	Don't try to tell me what to do.
VIOLET	f	You need the money just like we do.
CAESAR	m	Shut up, Violet.
VIOLET	f	Let us go and we'll make a deal.
CAESAR	m	Shut the fuck up!
CAESAR	m	What did you do to her?!  This isn't  my Violet!
CAESAR	m	What did she do to you?
VIOLET	f	Everything you couldn't.
CAESAR	m	You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing  before I met you.  You were nothing!
CAESAR	m	Who gave you this place?  This  apartment?
CAESAR	m	Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I  gave you everything!  I gave you  this life!  I made you, Violet.  I  saved you.
CAESAR	m	I saved you.
VIOLET	f	Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at  yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug.   |You launder money for the mob.  You  rent women like you rented this  apartment.
VIOLET	f	Saved me?  You don't even know me.   You used me, Caesar, just like I  used you.  All part of the business.
CAESAR	m	You betrayed me!
VIOLET	f	You murdered Gino!
CAESAR	m	I had to.  You made me.
VIOLET	f	Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me.   You did it because you couldn't stand  the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
CAESAR	m	Shut up!
CAESAR	m	Okay, you want business, I'll give  you the fucking business.
CAESAR	m	I'm going to make you beg just like  Shelly did.  Just like Shelly!
VIOLET	f	I'm sorry, Corky ...
CORKY	m	Don't be sorry.  Help me.
CAESAR	m	Oh, no no no.
CAESAR	m	Hey, Violet, you remember these?
CAESAR	m	I'm going to start with her so you'll  get a good idea what's coming.
CAESAR	m	I'm going to ask you where the money  is.  Every time you don't give me an  answer, I'm going to cut off one  finger.
CORKY	m	No.
CAESAR	m	When I reach ten, then I'll start  with you.
CAESAR	m	Where is the money?
CAESAR	m	...  Mickey.
CAESAR	m	I said where --
CORKY	m	No!  I'll tell you!
CORKY	m	It's over there in the empty  apartment.
CORKY	m	I put it inside one of the paint  drums.
CAESAR	m	I promised I would kill you.
CORKY	m	You can't kill me yet.
CAESAR	m	Why?
CORKY	m	I could be lying.
CAESAR	m	You're going to wish to God you hadn't  done that.
CAESAR	m	Fuck.
CAESAR	m	Son of a bitch ...
CAESAR	m	Mickey will get in.  I know he will.
CAESAR	m	Violet.  I can kill you right now if  that's what you want.  If you want  to live, then you have to help me.   I need you to make Mickey believe  that everything is normal.
CAESAR	m	Tell me, do you want to live?
CAESAR	m	Good girl.
CAESAR	m	Jesus Christ!
CAESAR	m	Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the  shit outta me.
CAESAR	m	What is this?  what are you two doing,  sneaking in here with your peckers  in your hands?  You gonna do me,  Mick?  Is that it?
MICKEY	m	No, Cease.  There was no answer.
CAESAR	m	I thought I heard someone knocking.
MICKEY	m	I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I  guess you couldn't hear me on account  of being in the shower.
CAESAR	m	Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was  so wound up about Gino, she was trying  to help me relax.
MICKEY	m	That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish  someone would help me relax.
CAESAR	m	Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get  you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
MICKEY	m	We was worried about you, Cease.
CAESAR	m	Me?  Why?
MICKEY	m	We went over to Johnnie's place just  to check it out and it was busted  up, Bad.
MICKEY	m	I started thinking maybe it's about  the money so I call you, but all I  get is the busy signal.  I figure  the phone is off the hook, that's  why I come rushing over here.
CAESAR	m	Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a  fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't  it?
MICKEY	m	Hey, if Violet was helping me relax,  I'd probably do the same thing.
MICKEY	m	Cease, can I ask you something?
CAESAR	m	Yeah.
MICKEY	m	Why'd you move all the furniture  around?
MICKEY	m	Let me guess.  That was Violet's  idea, too.
CAESAR	m	Actually, yeah, she was nervous about  Gino coming, wanted everything to  look right.  You know women, Mick.
MICKEY	m	Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid  things, don't they.
MICKEY	m	Is that the money?
CAESAR	m	Yeah, that's it.
MICKEY	m	That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand  it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were  him I would have bailed a long time  ago.  I mean, how much money does a  man need?
MICKEY	m	I remember I was just staring at all  this goddamn money, Shelly down on  his knees, and the next thing I know,  Johnnie just blows his head off.
MICKEY	m	What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's  laughing his ass off and that's when  Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He  coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks  Johnnie Marzzone.
MICKEY	m	Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
CAESAR	m	The key, yeah, the key's in my pants  in the bathroom.
MICKEY	m	Fuck it, I don't need the key.
MICKEY	m	I didn't need a key to get in here,  did I?
MICKEY	m	Who the hell could that be?
MICKEY	m	You gonna answer it?
CESAR 	m	Hello?
VIOLET	f	Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino.
CAESAR 	m	What?
VIOLET	f	You're blowing your only chance.   Act like I'm Gino.
CAESAR	m	Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've  been going crazy over here, Gino!
VIOLET 	f	Good boy.
CAESAR	m	It's Gino!  It's Gino!
MICKEY	m	Where in the hell is he?
VIOLET	f	We were in a car accident --
CAESAR 	m	They were in a car accident.
VIOLET	f	But everybody is all right.
CAESAR	m	They're all fine.  Just bruises and  shit.
VIOLET 	f	Now you listen to me, asshole, I  know your gun is behind the bar ...
MICKEY	m	Un-fucking-believable.  I called  those highway patrol dumb fucks.
CAESAR	m	Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
VIOLET 	f	We make a deal or I come out and  hand this phone to Mickey.
CAESAR	m	I'm listening.
VIOLET	f	I want what's mine, half the money.   We get rid of Mickey, no one else  dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
CAESAR 	m	Yes, I understand.
VIOLET	f	Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the  Kennedy, in the waiting room, but  stay on the phone until I come out.
CAESAR 	m	Sure, Gino, sure.
CAESAR	m	St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.   Okay, Gino.
VIOLET	f	Mickey?  What are you doing here?
MICKEY	m	Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They  were in a car accident.
VIOLET	f	Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
MICKEY	m	I think everything is okay.
CAESAR	m	They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting  room.
MICKEY	m	I can't fit them all in my car so  give me your keys.  You drive my  car, Lou.
CAESAR	m	Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet!
CAESAR	m	Go grab my car keys from my pants in  the bathroom.
CAESAR	m	Please, help us out, Mickey wants to  get going.
MICKEY	m	They might want to go straight to  the airport and back to Miami, so I  better take this.
MICKEY	m	You got the key?
CAESAR	m	Oh yeah.  Violet!
CAESAR 	m	Violet!
CAESAR 	m	Violet!
MICKEY	m	Thanks, V.
CAESAR	m	Call me as soon as you get him.
MICKEY	m	Leave your phone on the hook.
CAESAR	m	Now that's teamwork.
VIOLET	f	I should have let him kill you.
CAESAR	m	You know he would have done you,  too.
VIOLET	f	I knew I couldn't trust you.
CAESAR	m	I said I'd let you live and I will.
CAESAR	m	Maybe.
CAESAR	m	Time to find out if the dyke was  stupid enough to lie.
CAESAR	m	Yes!
CAESAR	m	No!
CAESAR	m	Violet!
CAESAR	m	Fuck!
CAESAR	m	Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now!
VIOLET	f	Come on.  Come on, please.
CAESAR	m	Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch.
VIOLET	f	Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!
MICKEY 	m	Violet?
VIOLET	f	He made me help him, Mickey, God, I  was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all  Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's  coming - Oh God!
VIOLET	f	Corky?
VIOLET	f	Corky!
VIOLET	f	Stop!
VIOLET	f	It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey.   He's on his way.
VIOLET	f	Get out of here, Caesar.  If you  want to live you had better start  running.
CAESAR	m	All these years and you still don't  know me, Violet.
CAESAR	m	But I know you.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, don't.
CAESAR	m	What are you going to do, V?  Shoot  me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't  think so.  I'll tell you why.  If  you had it in you to pull that  trigger, you would have done it a  long time ago.  If I was you, I would  have killed me the minute I brought  the money home.  But you didn't and  I know why, because you don't want  to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?   No, I know you don't.
VIOLET	f	Caesar, you don't know shit.
VIOLET	f	I will never understand it, Mickey.   You didn't even call the police.
MICKEY	m	I told you, the family doesn't want  the police around.  We want to take  care of it ourselves and we will.   I'll find him.  I swear I will.
VIOLET	f	I know you will.
MICKEY	m	Sure you're going to be okay?  I  mean, if you're having second  thoughts, my offer still stands.
VIOLET	f	Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get  out, you know?  Get away from all of  this.
VIOLET	f	But thanks.  Thanks for everything.
CORKY	m	Hey.
VIOLET	f	Hey.
CORKY	m	How'd it go?
VIOLET	f	I'm here, aren't I?
CORKY	m	I guess we should get out of here.
CORKY	m	Thought we might need a getaway car.
CORKY	m	You know what the difference is  between us, Violet?
VIOLET	f	No.
CORKY	m	...  Me neither.
