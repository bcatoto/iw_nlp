AD	m	I'm looking for James. Has anybody  seen James Ballard? You know who I  mean? The producer of this epic.
GRIP	m	I think I saw him in the camera  department.
AD	m	James? James, are you in there? Could  we please get your stamp of approval  on our little tracking shot?
JAMES	m	Of course. Be there in a minute.
CAMERA GIRL	f	It'll take more than a minute.
JAMES	m	Where were you?
CATHERINE	f	In the private aircraft hangar.  Anybody could have walked in.
JAMES	m	Did you come?
CATHERINE	f	No. What about your camera girl? Did  she come?
JAMES	m	We were interrupted. I had to go  back to the set...
CATHERINE	f	Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I  arrange to have her seduce me? She  desperately needs a conquest.
JAMES	m	I've been thinking about that, about  you and Karen.
CATHERINE	f	There, that's better.
JAMES	m	Thank you.
CATHERINE	f	Not a lot of action here.
JAMES	m	They consider this to be the airport  hospital. This ward is reserved for  air-crash victims. The beds are kept  waiting.
CATHERINE	f	If I groundloop during my flying  lesson on Saturday you might wake up  and find me next to you.
JAMES	m	I'll listen for you buzzing over.
JAMES	m	Is that a gift from Wendel? It has  an aeronautical feel to it.
CATHERINE	f	Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate the  licence approval for our air-charter  firm. I forgot to tell you.
JAMES	m	That's going well, then.
CATHERINE	f	Well, yes. You're getting out of bed tomorrow.  They want you to walk.
CATHERINE	f	The other man, the dead man, his  wife is a doctor -- Dr Helen  Remington. She's here, somewhere. As  a patient, of course. Maybe you'll  find her in the hallways tomorrow on  your walk.
JAMES	m	And her husband? What was he?
CATHERINE	f	He was a chemical engineer with a  food company.
STUDENT NURSE	m	No smoking, please.
STUDENT NURSE	m	Are you this gentleman's wife? Mrs  Ballard?
CATHERINE	f	Yes.
STUDENT NURSE	m	You can stay for this, then.
CATHERINE	f	Aida telephoned to say how sorry she  was, but could you look at the  storyboards again, she's made a number  of changes.
JAMES	m	Where's the car?
CATHERINE	f	Outside in the visitors' car-park.
JAMES	m	What!? They brought the car here?
CATHERINE	f	My car, not yours. Yours is a complete  wreck. The police dragged it to the  pound behind the station.
JAMES	m	Have you seen it?
CATHERINE	f	The sergeant asked me to identify  it. He didn't believe you'd gotten  out alive.
JAMES	m	It's about time.
CATHERINE	f	It is?
JAMES	m	After being bombarded endlessly by  road-safety propaganda, it's almost  a relief to have found myself in an  actual accident.
VAUGHAN	m	James Ballard?
JAMES	m	Yes?
VAUGHAN	m	Crash victim?
JAMES	m	Yes.
VAUGHAN	m	We'll deal with these later.
JAMES	m	Dr. Remington...?
CATHERINE	f	Both front wheels and the engine  were driven back into the driver's  section, bowing the floor. Blood  still marked the hood, streamers of  black lace running toward the  windshield-wiper gutters.
CATHERINE	f	Minute flecks were spattered across  the seat and steering wheel. The  instrument panel was buckled inwards,  cracking the clock and the speedometer  dials. The cabin was deformed, and  there was dust and glass and plastic  flakes everywhere inside. The  carpeting was damp and stank of blood  and other body and machine fluids.
JAMES	m	You should have gone to the funeral.
CATHERINE	f	I wish I had. They bury the dead so  quickly -- they should leave them  lying around for months.
JAMES	m	What about his wife? The woman doctor?  Have you visited her yet?
CATHERINE	f	No, I couldn't. I feel too close to  her.
CATHERINE	f	Renata tells me you're going to rent  a car.
JAMES	m	I can't sit on this balcony forever.  I'm beginning to feel like a potted  plant.
CATHERINE	f	How can you drive? James... your  legs. You can barely walk.
JAMES	m	Is the traffic heavier now? There  seem to be three times as many cars  as there were before the accident.
CATHERINE	f	I've never really noticed. Is Renata  going with you?
JAMES	m	I thought she might come along.  Handling a car again might be more  tiring than I imagine.
CATHERINE	f	I'm amazed that she'll let you drive  her.
JAMES	m	You're not envious?
CATHERINE	f	Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the  office. Are you going to be all right?
RENATA	f	Are we allowed to park here?
JAMES	m	No.
RENATA	f	I'm sure the police would make an  exception in your case.
JAMES	m	There's still a patch of blood there  on the road. Did you see it?
RENATA	f	I saw the blood. It looks like motor  oil.
JAMES	m	You were the last one I saw just  before the accident. Do you remember?  We made love.
RENATA	f	Are you still involving me in your  crash?
RENATA	f	Who is that man? Is he a private  detective?
RENATA	f	Can you drive?
JAMES	m	I can drive.
CATHERINE	f	I can't believe you've done this.
KAREN	f	This is the exact same car as your  old one, isn't it?
CATHERINE	f	Yes, it is. Are you planning to have another car  crash?
JAMES	m	I'm not thinking about the crash at  all.
HELEN	f	After this sort of thing, how do  people manage to look at a car, let  alone drive one? I'm trying to find Charles's car.
JAMES	m	It's not here. Maybe the police are  still holding it. Their forensic  people...
HELEN	f	They said it was here. They told me  this morning.
HELEN	f	This is your car?
JAMES	m	You'll tear your gloves.
JAMES	m	I don't think we should have come  here. I'm surprised the police don't  make it more difficult.
HELEN	f	Were you badly hurt? I think we saw  each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was  appalled to find that I have to pay  a small fee to have it scrapped.
JAMES	m	Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again.
JAMES	m	You haven't told me where we're going.
HELEN	f	Haven't I? To the airport, if you  could.
JAMES	m	The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
HELEN	f	Not yet -- though not soon enough  for some people, I've already found.  A death in the doctor's family makes  the patients doubly uneasy.
JAMES	m	I take it you're not wearing white  to reassure them.
HELEN	f	I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want  to.
JAMES	m	So -- why the airport?
HELEN	f	I work in the immigration department  there.
HELEN	f	Do you want a cigarette? I started  to smoke at the hospital. It's rather  stupid of me.
JAMES	m	Look at all this traffic. I'm not  sure I can deal with it.
HELEN	f	It's much worse now. You noticed  that, did you? The day I left the  hospital I had the extraordinary  feeling that all these cars were  gathering for some special reason I  didn't understand. There seemed to  be ten times as much traffic.
JAMES	m	Are we imagining it?
HELEN	f	You've bought yourself exactly the  same car again. It's the same shape  and colour.
HELEN	f	Turn up here into the car-park. It  won't be busy this time of day.
HELEN	f	I've found that I enjoy burying myself  in heavy traffic. I like to look at  it. Yesterday I hired a taxi-driver  to drive me around for an hour.  'Anywhere,' I said. We sat in a  massive traffic jam under an off- ramp. I don't think we moved more  than fifty yards. I'm thinking of taking up a new job  with the Road Research Laboratory.  They need a medical officer. The  salary is larger -- something I've  got to think about now. There's a  certain moral virtue in being  materialistic, I'm beginning to feel.  Well, it's a new approach for me, in  any case.
JAMES	m	The Road Research Laboratory? Where  they simulate car crashes?
HELEN	f	Yes.
JAMES	m	Isn't that rather too close...?
HELEN	f	That's the point. Besides, I know I  can give something now that I wasn't  remotely aware of before. It's not a  matter of duty so much as of  commitment.
RENATA	f	I almost forgot to give you this.  Probably because I know you're going  to like it.
JAMES	m	What is it?
RENATA	f	A complimentary ticket for a special  stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely  not part of the big auto show. There's  a map in the packet and a note  requesting you be discreet about the  location.
JAMES	m	Really? What kind of exhibition is  it?
RENATA	f	I suspect it involves re-enactments  of famous car crashes. You know,  Jayne Mansfield, James Dean, Albert  Camus...
JAMES	m	You're kidding.
RENATA	f	Serious. But you'll have to take  your new friend, the female crash- test dummy. She dropped it off for  you.
JAMES	m	You're not jealous, are you? You  have to understand... Helen and I  had this strange, intense...  experience together.
RENATA	f	We've had a few of those ourselves,  haven't we?
VAUGHAN	m	'Don't worry, that guy's gotta see  us!' These were the confident last  words of the brilliant young Hollywood  star James Dean as he piloted his  Porsche 550 Spyder race car toward a  date with death on a lonely stretch  of California two-lane blacktop,  Route 466. 'Don't worry, that guy's  gotta see us.' The year, 1955; the  day, September thirtieth; the time:  now.
JAMES	m	It's strange -- I thought all this  would be far more popular.
HELEN	f	The real thing is available free of  charge. Besides, it's not quite legal.  They can't advertise.
VAUGHAN	m	The first star of our show is 'Little  Bastard', James Dean's racing Porsche.  He named it after himself, and had  his racing number, 130, painted on  it.
JAMES	m	Who is that? The announcer. Do I  know him?
HELEN	f	That's Vaughan. He talked to you at  the hospital.
JAMES	m	Oh, yes. I thought he was a medical  photographer, doing some sort of  accident research. He wanted every  conceivable detail about our crash.
HELEN	f	When I first met Vaughan, he was a  specialist in international  computerized traffic systems. I don't  know what he is now.
VAUGHAN	m	The second star is stuntman and former  race driver -- Colin Seagrave, who  will drive our replica of James Dean's  car.
VAUGHAN	m	I myself shall play the role of James  Dean's racing mechanic, Rolf  Wï¿½therich, sent over from the Porsche  factory in Zuffenhausen, Germany.  This mechanic was himself fated to  die in a car crash in Germany twenty- six years later. And the third and  in some ways most important party,  the college student Donald Turnupseed,  played by movie stuntman Brett Trask.
VAUGHAN	m	Turnupseed was on his way back to  his home in Fresno for the weekend.  James Dean was on his way to an  automobile race in Salinas, a dusty  town in northern California. The two  would only meet for one moment, but  it was a moment that would create a  Hollywood legend.
VAUGHAN	m	You'll notice that we are not wearing  helmets or safety padding of any  kind, and our cars are not equipped  with roll cages or seat-belts. We  depend solely on the skill of our  drivers for our safety, so that we  can bring you the ultimate in  authenticity. All right, here we go.  The fatal crash of James Dean!
JAMES	m	Is that part of the act or are they  really hurt?
HELEN	f	I don't know. You can never be sure  with Vaughan. This is his show.
VAUGHAN	m	Rolf Wï¿½therich was thrown from the  Porsche and spent a year in the  hospital recovering from his injuries.  Donald Turnupseed was found wandering  around in a daze, basically unhurt.  James Dean died of a broken neck and  became immortal.
COLIN	m	Hold me. I'm dizzy. I can't stand  up.
HELEN	f	I know that man, Seagrave, the stunt  driver. I think he's genuinely hurt.
POLICE	m	This is an illegal and unauthorized  automotive demonstration which is in  contravention of the Highway Traffic  Act. You are all liable to fines and  possible arrest and confinement...  Disperse at once! Disperse at once!
HELEN	f	What's the matter with Seagrave?
VAUGHAN	m	Hit his head, I think. His balance  is off.
JAMES	m	Why are the police taking this all  so seriously?
VAUGHAN	m	It's not the police. It's the  Department of Transport. Internal  politics. It's a joke. They have no  idea who we really are.
VAUGHAN	m	That was glib, wasn't it? 'James  Dean died of a broken neck and became  immortal.' But I couldn't resist.
VERA	f	Oh, God. What happened? Here, lie  down.
HELEN	f	They did the James Dean crash. It  seemed to go perfectly. But he started  to feel nauseous on the way back.  I'm sure it's concussion.
VERA	f	Ah, well... We're familiar enough  with that, then, aren't we?
VAUGHAN	m	I'd really like to work out the  details of the Jayne Mansfield crash  with you. We could do the decapitation --  her head embedded in the windshield --  and the little dead dog thing as  well. You know, the Chihuahuas in  the back seat. I've got it figured  out.
COLIN	m	You know I'll be ready, Vaughan. But  I'll want to wear really big tits --  out to here -- so the crowd can see  them get cut up and crushed on the  dashboard.
VAUGHAN	m	Don't leave yet, Ballard. I want you  to help me.
JAMES	m	Do you live here? With Seagrave?
VAUGHAN	m	I live in my car. This is my workshop.
VAUGHAN	m	And this is the new project, Ballard.
JAMES	m	What kind of help can I possibly be  to you? You seem to be everywhere at  once as it is.
GABRIELLE	f	Thought you might be missing these. So here you are at the nerve centre.  Vaughan makes everything look like a  crime, doesn't he?
JAMES	m	What exactly is your project, Vaughan?  A book of crashes? A medical study?  A sensational documentary? Global  traffic?
VAUGHAN	m	It's something we're all intimately  involved in: the reshaping of the  human body by modern technology.
JAMES	m	Vaughan, what the hell are you doing?  Are you trying to create your own  Famous Crash?
VAUGHAN	m	It excited her, Ballard. Your wife,  Catherine. She enjoyed it. Ask her.
CATHERINE	f	He must have fucked a lot of women  in that huge car of his. It's like a  bed on wheels. It must smell of  semen...
JAMES	m	It does.
CATHERINE	f	Do you find him attractive?
JAMES	m	He's very pale. Covered with scars.
CATHERINE	f	Would you like to fuck him, though?  In that car?
JAMES	m	No. But when he's in that car...
CATHERINE	f	Have you seen his penis?
JAMES	m	I think it's badly scarred too. From  a motorcycle accident.
CATHERINE	f	Is he circumcised? Can you imagine  what his anus is like? Describe it  to me. Would you like to sodomize  him? Would you like to put your penis  right into his anus, thrust it up  his anus? Tell me, describe it to  me. Tell me what you would do. How  would you kiss him in that car?  Describe how you'd reach over and  unzip his greasy jeans, then take  out his penis. Would you kiss it or  suck it right away? Which hand would  you hold it in? Have you ever sucked  a penis? Do you know what semen tastes  like? Have you ever tasted semen?  Some semen is saltier than others.  Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
HELEN	f	Have you come?
JAMES	m	Please finish your story.
HELEN	f	The junior pathologist at Ashford  Hospital. Then the husband of a  colleague of mine, then a trainee  radiologist, then the service manager  at my garage.
JAMES	m	And you had sex with all of these  men in cars? Only in cars?
HELEN	f	Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
JAMES	m	And did you fantasize that Vaughan  was photographing all these sex acts?  As though they were traffic accidents?
HELEN	f	Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.
VAUGHAN	m	Get all the paper you can, Ballard.  Some of the stuff they're giving  away is terrific: 'Mechanisms of  Occupant Ejection', 'Tolerances of  the Human Face in Crash Impacts'...
HELEN	f	We can have a look at it again on  the monitors. They're showing it in  slow motion.
VAUGHAN	m	I've always wanted to drive a crashed  car.
JAMES	m	You could get your wish at any moment.
VAUGHAN	m	No, I mean a crash with a history.  Camus's Facel Vega, or Nathaniel  West's station wagon, Grace Kelly's  Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to  get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't  touch anything else.
JAMES	m	Is that why you drive this car? I  take it that you see Kennedy's  assassination as a special kind of  car crash?
VAUGHAN	m	The case could be made.
VAUGHAN	m	Take a look at this and tell me what  you think.
JAMES	m	It's very... satisfying. I'm not  sure I understand why.
VAUGHAN	m	It's the future, Ballard, and you're  already part of it. For the first  time, a benevolent psychopathology  beckons towards us. For example, the  car crash is a fertilizing rather  than a destructive event -- a  liberation of sexual energy that  mediates the sexuality of those who  have died with an intensity impossible  in any other form. To fully understand  that, and to live that... that is my  project.
JAMES	m	What about the reshaping of the human  body by modern technology? I thought  that was your project.
VAUGHAN	m	A crude sci-fi concept that floats  on the surface and doesn't threaten  anybody. I use it to test the  resilience of my potential partners  in psychopathology.
VAUGHAN	m	You drive.
VAUGHAN	m	Let's get rid of that. I don't want  you blowing it up my urethra.
RENATA	f	Your friend's still out there.
RENATA	f	What does he want from you?
JAMES	m	Hard to say.
RENATA	f	I'm going to leave now. Do you want  a lift?
JAMES	m	No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
CATHERINE	f	They're questioning Vaughan about an  accident near the airport. Some  pedestrian... they think he was run  over intentionally.
JAMES	m	Vaughan isn't interested in  pedestrians.
CATHERINE	f	You'd better drive him. He's a bit  shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where  is yours?
JAMES	m	At home. I couldn't face all this  traffic.
CATHERINE	f	I'd better come with you, then. Are  you sure you can drive?
VAUGHAN	m	It's Seagrave. He was worried that  we would never do Jayne Mansfield's  crash, now that the police were  cracking down. So he did it himself.
VAUGHAN	m	The dog -- God, the dog is brilliant,  perfect. I wonder where he got it?
VAUGHAN	m	Come with me, James. I have to  document it.
JAMES	m	We must have driven through a pool  of blood. If the police stop you  again, they may impound the car while  they have the blood analyzed.
VAUGHAN	m	You're right, Ballard. There's an  all-night car-wash in the airport  service area.
SALESMAN	m	Is there something here that interests  you?
GABRIELLE	f	The white sports model. Could you  help me into it, please? I'd like to  see if I can fit into a car designed  for a normal body.
GABRIELLE	f	Don't. Not there.
GABRIELLE	f	Do it there. And then after that, do  it here.
AD	m	Somebody named Vaughan. Do you want  it?
JAMES	m	Hello? Ballard.
VAUGHAN	m	I need to see you, Ballard. I need  to talk to you about the project.
JAMES	m	Where are you?
VAUGHAN	m	You're making it too clean.
TATTOOIST	m	Medical tattoos are supposed to be  clean.
VAUGHAN	m	This isn't a medical tattoo. This is  a prophetic tattoo. Prophesy is dirty  and ragged. Make it dirty and ragged.
TATTOOIST	m	Prophetic? Is this personal prophesy  or global prophesy?
VAUGHAN	m	There's no difference. James -- I  want you to let her give you this  one.
JAMES	m	Where do you think that one should  go?
VAUGHAN	m	It should go here.
JAMES	m	I thought that was you, up there.
CATHERINE	f	My last lesson's next week. James... my car...
JAMES	m	What? Tell me.
CATHERINE	f	I wasn't driving. I'd left the car  in the parking-lot at the airport.  Could it have been deliberate?
JAMES	m	One of your suitors?
CATHERINE	f	One of my suitors.
JAMES	m	It's Vaughan. He's courting you.  Let's go find him.
JAMES	m	The traffic... where is everyone?  They've all gone away.
CATHERINE	f	I'd like to go back. James...
JAMES	m	Not yet. It's only beginning.
JAMES	m	Vera! Vera Seagrave!
JAMES	m	Are you leaving, Vera? Listen, I'm  trying to find Vaughan.
VERA	f	The police are after him. An American  serviceman was killed on the Northolt  overpass.
VERA	f	I was with him in the car at the  time.
JAMES	m	I think he'll be waiting for us at  the airport.
CATHERINE	f	James...
JAMES	m	I'd like to register a claim for the  black 1963 Lincoln, the one that  came in a couple of days ago. Is  there a form I can fill out?
POUND OFFICER	m	There certainly is, but you'll have  to come back between 7:30 and 4:30  to get one. What's your attachment  to that thing?
JAMES	m	A close friend owned it.
POUND OFFICER	m	Well, it's got to be a total write- off. I don't see what you could  possibly do with it.
JAMES	m	Catherine. Are you all right? Are  you hurt?
CATHERINE	f	James, I... I don't know... I think  I'm all right...
JAMES	m	Maybe the next one, darling... Maybe  the next one...
