MISSION CONTROL	f	(On radio, faint) Explorer, please verify that the P1 ATA removal on replacement cap part 1 and 2 are complete.
EXPLORER CAP	m	(On radio, faint) DMA M1, M2, M3 and M4 are complete.
MISSION CONTROL	f	(On radio, faint) Copy that Explorer. Dr Stone-Houston, requesting status update...
WOMAN	f	Installation ninety-five percent complete. Running level one diagnostics on circuits, sensors, and power. Standby.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Standing by. Looks like we're on schedule. Dr. Stone, Medical is concerned about your ECG readings.
WOMAN	f	I'm fine Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Well, medical doesn't agree doctor. Are you feeling nauseous?
WOMAN	f	Not any more than usual, Houston. Diagnostics are green. Linking to communications card. Ready for data reception. If this works, when we touch down tomorrow, I'm buying all you guys a round of drinks.
MISSION CONTROL	f	That's a date, doctor. Just remember, Houston is partial to Margaritas.
WOMAN	f	OK, here we go... Booting comm card now. Please confirm link. Houston, please confirm reception of data.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Negative. We're not seeing any data.
WOMAN	f	Stand by, Houston. I'm gonna reboot the comm card.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Standing by.
ASTRONAUT	m	Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Please expand.
MATT	m	Okay, let me tell you a story. It was '96. I'd been up here 42 days. Every time I passed over Texas, I'd look down, knowing the second Mrs Kowalsky, was looking up, thinking of me. Six weeks I'm blowing kisses to that woman. Then we land at Edwards and I find out she'd run off with a lawyer before I was off the launch pad, so I packed my car and I headed to...
MISSION CONTROL	f	Tijuana. You've told this story, Kowalsky. As Houston recalls, she took off in your '74 GTO. Engineering requests fuel status on the jet pack prototype.
MATT	m	Five hours off the reservation and I show 30% drain. My compliments to Engineering. Except for a slight malfunction on the nulling of the roll axis, this jetpack is one prime piece of thrust.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Engineering says thank you.
MATT	m	Tell them I still prefer my '67 Corvette though. Speaking of which did I ever tell you the--
MISSION CONTROL	f	We know the Corvette story, Matt.
MATT	m	Even Engineering?
MISSION CONTROL	f	Especially engineering. We're going to miss you, Matt.
WOMAN	f	Comm card reboot in progress.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Thank you doctor. Shariff, what's your status?
SHARIFF	m	Nearly there. Replacing battery module A1 and C.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Could you be more specific? Indeterminate estimates make Houston anxious.
SHARIFF	m	No... no... no Houston, don't be anxious. Anxiety is not good for the heart... The system is ready to re- activate.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Hubble Telescope engaged. Upgrade fully functional. That applause you hear is for you, Shariff. Congratulations. Kick back, take the rest of the day off.
SHARIFF	m	Woohoo... Jaise Baadal Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai Oh Jaise Paani Ka, Yaarana Hai.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Matt, please advise as to Mission Specialist Shariff's current activity.
MATT	m	He appears to be doing the Macarena of some sort. Though that would merely be a best guess scenario on my part.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Dr. Stone. Houston. Medical now have you with a temperature drop to 35.9 and heart rate rise to 70. How are you doing?
WOMAN	f	Houston, I'm fine, it's just... ...Keeping your lunch down in zero G is harder than it looks.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Doctor Stone? Medical is asking if you want to return to Explorer?
WOMAN	f	No, we've been here for a week Houston, let's just finish this.
MISSION CONTROL	f	That's a negative. I'm afraid we're getting nothing on this end, doctor.
WOMAN	f	Try again.
MISSION CONTROL	f	(a beat, then...) Still nothing.
WOMAN	f	Houston, could you please turn that music off?
MISSION CONTROL	f	Kowalsky?
MATT	m	Not a problem.
WOMAN	f	Thank you, Kowalsky.
WOMAN	f	Now, Houston?
MISSION CONTROL	f	Negative.
WOMAN	f	Could Houston be misinterpreting the data--?
MISSION CONTROL	f	We're not receiving any data. Engineering is recommending a vis- check for component damage.
WOMAN	f	Mmmm. Let me see what's going on.
WOMAN	f	What have you got here?
WOMAN	f	Visual examination doesn't reveal any damaged components. The problem must be originating in the comms panel.
MISSION CONTROL	f	That seems to be the case. Engineering admits that you warned us that this could happen. That's as close to an apology as you're going to get from them. We should've listened to you doc.
WOMAN	f	I'm on it.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Copy that. How long do you think it'll take you?
WOMAN	f	An hour.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Outstanding. We appreciate your patience, Doctor. Installing your system in the Hubble is the main purpose of this mission.
MATT	m	Seventy-five minutes shy. Never crossed my mind.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Matt, It's been a privilege.
MATT	m	Right back atcha, Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Enjoy your last walk...
MATT	m	Am I a go to assist Dr. Stone in removing the panel?
WOMAN	f	Assistance appreciated.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Permission granted.
MATT	m	Thank you, Houston. Mind if I join the fun?
WOMAN	f	Certainly.
MATT	m	How are you feeling?
WOMAN	f	Like a Chihuahua that's being tumble dried.
MATT	m	It's been a rough week. If it makes you feel any better, I puked up everything but my kidneys on my first ride.
WOMAN	f	Whoa...! AWOL!
WOMAN	f	Thanks. Sorry. In my basement lab things usually fall to the floor.
MATT	m	Hey -- you're the genius up here. I just drive this bus.
WOMAN	f	Call me a genius if I can get this board initialized in the next hour.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Explorer, this is Houston.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Go ahead Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	f	NORAD reports a satellite has incurred a missile strike. The impact has created a cloud of debris orbiting at 20,000 miles per hour. Current debris orbit does not overlap with your trajectory. We'll keep you posted on any developments.
WOMAN	f	Should we be worried?
MATT	m	Let the boys down there worry for us.
WOMAN	f	Explorer, engage arm and pivot to cargo bay.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Standby for arm maneuver.
MATT	m	So doc, now that you work for NASA, how do you like it?
SHARIFF	m	Kinda like winning the lottery, isn't it?
WOMAN	f	I was just happy that they didn't cut the funding to my research.
MATT	m	How long was your training?
WOMAN	f	Six months.
SHARIFF	m	Including holidays?
MATT	m	So, what is this scanning system?
SHARIFF	m	Nothing rad, it's just a new set of eyes to scan the universe.
WOMAN	f	Assuming it works, it's just for hospital use. This one is a prototype.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Standby for marking.
MATT	m	Listen, they don't bankroll prototypes, even for your pretty blue eyes.
WOMAN	f	My eyes are brown.
MATT	m	Right now your eyes are blood shut.
SHARIFF	m	Kowalsky!
SHARIFF	m	Is this great or what?!
MATT	m	(for Ryan's benefit) And to think he went to Harvard.
MATT	m	You gotta admit one thing. You can't beat the view....
WOMAN	f	Mm-hm.
MATT	m	"Mmm?" So what do you like about being up here?
WOMAN	f	The silence. I could get used to it.
MATT	m	Hmmmm. Terrific.
WOMAN	f	Houston, from first inspection comms panel appears to be dead. Am I a go to cut link to auxiliary?
MISSION CONTROL	f	You're the expert, doctor. It's your call.
MATT	m	Houston, I have a bad feeling about this mission.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Please elaborate.
MATT	m	It's the same feeling I had at Mardi Gras in 1987...?
MISSION CONTROL	f	That is affirmative. Surprisingly, control hasn't heard the Mardi Gras story. Please proceed.
MATT	m	Well, it's day one and I'm bumping my way down Bourbon Street looking for the sister of a friend of mine. The streets are swimming with people, I'm thinking there's no way I'm finding this girl...
WOMAN	f	Proceeding to over ride.
MATT	m	Then all of a sudden I look up and -- there she is.
MATT	m	I am about to yell out when I notice she's holding hands with a short hairy guy in board shorts and a Margaritaville T-shirt. Then I realize, the guy's no guy. My sister's friend is holding hands with a--
MISSION CONTROL	f	ISS, this is Houston. Zlotze Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Explorer, this is Houston.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Go ahead Houston.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Mission abort. Repeat: mission abort. Initiate emergency disconnect from Hubble. Begin re-entry procedure. Start Deorbit Prep for PLS at Kennedy. ISS, initiate emergency evacuation.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Copy all Houston, and in work. Matt, immediate return to Explorer. Repeat, immediate return to Explorer.
MATT	m	Roger. Explorer, prep airlock!
EXPLORER CAP	m	Airlock engaged--ready to receive.
MATT	m	Houston. Elaborate.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Debris from the impact has caused a chain reaction, hitting other satellites in its path and creating new debris. Norad reports that orbital and ballistic effects are driving the cloud of debris up toward your altitude. How copy?
MATT	m	Copy all Houston. Put a bow on it Dr. Stone.
WOMAN	f	I can't. If I turn it off now we'll lose the whole system.
MATT	m	I'm not going to ask you again.
MATT	m	Not one second. Now! Shut it down!
WOMAN	f	Sorry. I'm sorry. It's done.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Kowalsky, initiate emergency disconnect from the Hubble.
MATT	m	Alright Shariff, let's do this.
SHARIFF	m	Roger.
MATT	m	Houston. Update.
MISSION CONTROL	f	We have a full on chain reaction. It's been confirmed that it is the unintentional side effect of the Russians striking one of their own satellites.
SHARIFF	m	They shot down their own satellite?
MATT	m	Right of disposal. Most likely a spy sat gone bad. Now it's space junk.
MATT	m	Explorer, ready to disengage HST.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Locks releasing in three... two... one...
MISSION CONTROL	f	Explorer, new data coming through.
MATT	m	What's the blowback, Houston?
MISSION CONTROL	f	It's not good. Most of our systems are going down. Debris chain reaction is out of control and rapidly expanding. Multiple sats are now down and they keep on falling.
MATT	m	Define "multiple" sats.
MISSION CONTROL	f	Most of them. Telecomunications systems are gone. Expect a communication blackout at any moment.
WOMAN	f	Kowalsky, visual of debris at nine o'clock.
MATT	m	Half of North America just lost their Facebook.
MISSION CONTROL	f	You're a go for TH1138. Repeat You're a go for TH1138 procedure.
EXPLORER CAP	m	Copy that Houston.
MATT	m	Explorer, this is Kowalsky. Confirming visual contact with debris. Debris is from a BSE sat. To repeat--
SHARIFF	m	Heads up!
MATT	m	To repeat I have-
WOMAN	f	Dr. Stone requesting faster, faster transport.
MATT	m	We have to go. Go, go! Go!
MISSION CONTROL	f	Attention. New data suggests immediate evacuation absolu...
WOMAN	f	Dr. Stone requesting faster transport to the bay area. Explorer get me down.
MATT	m	Explorer permission to retrieve Dr. Stone.
EXPLORER CAP	m	You are a go, Kowalsky. Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? Houston, this is Explorer. Copy? We lost Houston!
MATT	m	Unstrap! You can't tune out the world up here.
WOMAN	f	I'm trying...
MATT	m	Try releasing the safety clip.
SHARIFF	m	Need some help there Matt?
MATT	m	No, don't wait for us. Get inside.
WOMAN	f	It's stuck!
MATT	m	Man down! Man down!
MATT	m	Disengage!!!
MATT	m	Explorer has been hit. Explorer do you read? Explorer, over. Explorer--
MATT	m	Astronaut off structure! Dr. Stone is off structure!
MATT	m	Dr. Stone, detach!
WOMAN	f	Nooooo!
MATT	m	You must detach!
WOMAN	f	No.
MATT	m	If you don't detach that arm is going to carry you too far!
WOMAN	f	I can't!
MATT	m	(a brief beat, then) Listen to my voice. You need to focus. I'm losing visual of you. In a few seconds I won't be able to track you.
WOMAN	f	(She pulls herself together) Ok. Ok.
MATT	m	You need to detach. I can't see you anymore.
WOMAN	f	I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT	m	Do it. Now!
WOMAN	f	Ok. I'm trying! I can't it's stuck, Hold on.
MATT	m	Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone... Houston, I've lost visual of Dr. Stone.
MATT	m	Dr. Stone! Do you copy?! Repeat! Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Yes. Yes. I copy. I'm detached!
MATT	m	...Give me your position!
WOMAN	f	I don't know. I don't know! I'm spinning. I can't. I can't.
MATT	m	Report your position.
WOMAN	f	GPS is...down. I can't, it's down, I can't.
MATT	m	Give me a visual.
WOMAN	f	I told you! Nothing. I see nothing!
MATT	m	Do you have a visual of Explorer?
MATT	m	Do you have a visual of ISS?
MATT	m	I need you to focus. Give me a visual... anything.
WOMAN	f	It's too fast.
WOMAN	f	I can't breathe. I can't...breathe...
WOMAN	f	Houston, this is Dr. Ryan Stone.. I'm drifting but I have a visual of Explorer.
WOMAN	f	With North at 12 o'clock, the Shuttle is at the center of the dial.
WOMAN	f	I can see the Chinese station. No, no, no, it's the International Space Station.
WOMAN	f	ISS is at 6, no, 7 o'clock.
WOMAN	f	Lieutenant Kowalsky, do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Explorer, do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Houston, do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Houston, this is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. I'm off structure and I'm drifting.
WOMAN	f	Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Anybody...? Anyone...? Please copy.
MATT	m	... Stone. Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	(almost to herself) Lieutenant Kowalsky?...
MATT	m	Repeat. Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	YES! YES! I copy! I'm here!
MATT	m	Flash your light.
WOMAN	f	My light?
MATT	m	So I can see you.
WOMAN	f	Here! Here!
MATT	m	There you are. Hang tight. Report your status.
WOMAN	f	I'm... I'm alright... I'm fine.
MATT	m	Your status! Give me your readings?
WOMAN	f	3.6 psi, I think.
MATT	m	Your O2. Give me your O2.
WOMAN	f	Steady at eight percent...no seven...
MATT	m	You're breathing too fast. You're burning oxygen. We don't want to do that. We want to relax. Copy.
WOMAN	f	Copy.
MATT	m	Nearly there.
WOMAN	f	Please hurry.
MATT	m	You can holster that torch, Dr. Stone.
WOMAN	f	Oh. Sorry.
MATT	m	Gotcha.
WOMAN	f	Arghh!
MATT	m	Now, I'm going to tether you to me.
MATT	m	I know. You never realized how devastatingly good-looking I am.
MATT	m	But I need you to stop staring and help me with the tether. Okay?
WOMAN	f	Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Ohh I got it.
MATT	m	Ok. So far so good. Now listen. I'm going to give you a little push, just so you're clear of the jets--
MATT	m	Sorry. Not a push, more like a nudge.
WOMAN	f	No... No... No... Wait... Don't.
WOMAN	f	Nooooooo!!!! Dammit!!!
MATT	m	See? Where you go, I go.
MATT	m	Better. Let's get out of here.
WOMAN	f	Ahh Dammit!
MATT	m	I know what you mean.
WOMAN	f	Ahhh Dammit.
MATT	m	You're burning oxygen, we're going to go back to the shuttle. How's that for a plan. Copy?
MATT	m	Right copy that.
MATT	m	Houston this is Kowalsky. How do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Why aren't they answering?
MATT	m	It seems like communications are lost.
WOMAN	f	Can they hear us on an alternate frequency?
MATT	m	We don't know. That's why we keep talking. If someone is listening they might just save your life. Set your watch for ninety minutes.
WOMAN	f	Why ninety?
MATT	m	Houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. Factoring in our current orbit, I reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again.
WOMAN	f	02 down to six percent.
MATT	m	Okay. Pretty scary shit being untethered up here, isn't it?
WOMAN	f	Yeah. Pretty scary shit.
MATT	m	(after a beat) You did all right.
MATT	m	(to the Shuttle) Houston, in the blind. This is Kowalsky. Our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the Explorer. Dr. Stone and I would like to retrieve the body of Mission Specialist Shariff and return it to Shuttle. Am I a go to retrieve?
MATT	m	Roger that.
WOMAN	f	Where is he? Where is he?
WOMAN	f	Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
MATT	m	Grab him!
WOMAN	f	I'm trying. I'm trying.
MATT	m	Quick. You're pulling me away.
WOMAN	f	I got him. I got him.
MATT	m	Clutch him like he's your Valentine. I can't gauge my thrust with you two yo- yoing around.
MATT	m	(under his breath) Jesus...
MATT	m	Here's hoping you've got one monster insurance policy, Houston. Damages to Explorer are... it's totaled. Will commence search for survivors.
WOMAN	f	02 down to five percent.
MATT	m	All right, here we go. Careful of the edges.
MATT	m	Houston, in the blind. To confirm. Mission Specialist Dr. Stone and myself, Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky, are the sole survivors of
WOMAN	f	I apologize for not complying. I should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.
MATT	m	We were going to be hit no matter what. There was nothing you could've done to change that.
MATT	m	Hey.
WOMAN	f	Yes?
MATT	m	Alright... We have to get ourselves to the Space Station. There.
MATT	m	It's a bit of a hike, but it's our only... It's our best option. Agreed?
MATT	m	Dr. Stone... (as she turns) Agreed?
WOMAN	f	Agreed.
MATT	m	Alright. After you.
MATT	m	Houston in the blind, this is Kowalsky. Dr. Stone and I have determined to proceed to ISS and use one of their Soyuz for re-entry. ISS if copy, please send rescue mission. Repeat please dispatch rescue mission.
WOMAN	f	02 down to two percent.
MATT	m	We're getting there.
MATT	m	Beautiful, don't you think?
WOMAN	f	What?
MATT	m	The sunrise. That's what I'm going to miss the most.
MATT	m	So, where's home, Dr. Stone?
MATT	m	Ryan. Where's home?
WOMAN	f	Home?
MATT	m	Ah ha. Down there. Mother Earth. Where do you pitch your tent?
WOMAN	f	Lake Zurich.
MATT	m	Where the hell is that?
WOMAN	f	Illinois.
MATT	m	Illinois. Central time zone. That makes it roughly... 8pm right now. What are the good people of Lake Zurich doing at 8 o'clock in the evening?
WOMAN	f	I don't know...
MATT	m	What would you be doing?
MATT	m	Come on. It's 8 o'clock. You've just clocked out of the hospital after putting in your customary 18-hour shift. You're driving home...
WOMAN	f	The radio. I listen to the radio...
MATT	m	There we go. Let me guess. NPR? Classical. Top for--
WOMAN	f	Anything. Doesn't matter. As long as they don't talk. I just drive...
MATT	m	What do you miss down there?
MATT	m	Is there a Mr. Stone?
WOMAN	f	No...
MATT	m	Nobody special? Someone down there, looking up, thinking of you?
WOMAN	f	I had a daughter.
MATT	m	What was her name?
WOMAN	f	Sarah... She was four. Stupidest thing- a school trip to the swimming pool. She was playing tag- she slipped, hit her head, and that was it... She loved tag. I'm sure she was laughing.
WOMAN	f	When I received the call I was driving and ever since that's what I do. I wake up, I go to work and then I just drive.
WOMAN	f	02 down to one percent.
MATT	m	Well, well, what d'you know. I have good news and bad news.
WOMAN	f	Uhuh?
MATT	m	The good news is we're five minutes from the ISS and I know where the Russians stash their vodka... and that's a good thing cus I'm running out of fumes. Bad news is I'm gonna be ten minutes short of......breaking Anatoly's record.
WOMAN	f	Mmm...Mmmm.
MATT	m	What?
WOMAN	f	I'm red lining... My O2 tank pressure is low...
MATT	m	The tank may be empty but there's still oxygen in your suit, so sip, Ryan. Don't gulp. It's wine, not beer. Sip. We'll get you there.
MATT	m	Let's go.
MATT	m	Houston in the blind we have visual of the ISS. Station must have been evacuated because first Soyuz is missing. Second Soyuz exhibits surface damage and chute has deployed. It's use as escape pod for re-entry to Earth is impossible.
WOMAN	f	Shouldn't we be turning? We're
MATT	m	Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We want to drift. I wasn't kidding about those fumes. This can has one or two good thrusts left. If we're lucky....
MATT	m	Steady...
MATT	m	Ready... aim...
MATT	m	...fire.
WOMAN	f	Break... You have to break.
MATT	m	I can't. Can's empty. We're coming in fast and we're going to hit hard. Grab onto anything you can and hold tight!
WOMAN	f	I got it. I got it.
WOMAN	f	The tether broke. I'm detached. I'm I'm detached.
MATT	m	Grab a hold. Grab anything.
MATT	m	Give me... give me five here, Ryan.
WOMAN	f	I've got you. I've got you--
MATT	m	Shit... shit...
WOMAN	f	No. No. No. Don't you. No. Don't you. Don't. Don't. NO
WOMAN	f	Gotcha!
MATT	m	You have to let me go.
WOMAN	f	What? No--
MATT	m	You have to.
WOMAN	f	No!
MATT	m	Those ropes are too loose, I'm pulling you with me. You have to let me go or we both die--
WOMAN	f	I'm not letting you go! We're fine.
MATT	m	Ryan!
WOMAN	f	You're not going anywhere, you're not
MATT	m	It's not up to you.
WOMAN	f	Please don't do this.
WOMAN	f	Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
MATT	m	You're going to make it Ryan.
WOMAN	f	I had you! I had you.
MATT	m	Ryan do you copy? Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	My CO2 alarm went off. My CO2 alarm went off.
MATT	m	You need to board the station. Can you see the airlock?
MAT	m	Do you copy? (P.O.V shot - beginning to blur)
WOMAN	f	Yes. Yes. I see it. I see it.
MATT	m	Good. That's where you want to go. You're losing focus, right?
WOMAN	f	Yes.
MATT	m	That's because you're breathing CO2 and you're losing consciousness. You need to board the Station.
MATT	m	Move!
WOMAN	f	Ok.
MATT	m	Now listen to me. That second Soyuz is too damaged for re-entry, but it's perfectly fine for a little Sunday drive.
WOMAN	f	Sunday drive...?
MATT	m	Look to the west... You see that dot in the distance? That is the Chinese Station. You're going to take the Soyuz and cruise over there. The Chinese lifeboat is a Shenzou.
WOMAN	f	I've never flown a Shenzhou--
MATT	m	That doesn't matter. Its re-entry protocol is identical to the Soyuz's--
WOMAN	f	Ok.
MATT	m	You've never flown a Soyuz either.
WOMAN	f	Only on a simulator.
MATT	m	So then you know.
WOMAN	f	I crashed it. I--
MATT	m	It's a Simulator. That's what it's designed for.
WOMAN	f	Every time. I crashed the Simulator every time.
MATT	m	It's not rocket science. Just point the damn thing at earth and by this time tomorrow you'll be back in Lake Zurich with one hell of a story to tell. You copy? Ryan. You copy?
WOMAN	f	I'm going to take the Soyuz and come get you.
MATT	m	No you're not. . I have too much of a head start. That ship already sailed.
WOMAN	f	No. I'm coming to get you.
MATT	m	Ryan, you're going to have to learn to let go.
WOMAN	f	But... I...
MATT	m	I want to hear you say you're going to make it.
MATT	m	Ryan! Say it!
WOMAN	f	I'm... I'm going to make it.
MATT	m	Alright. Keep going
MATT	m	What kind of name is Ryan for a girl?
WOMAN	f	Dad wanted a boy.
MATT	m	Are you close to the airlock?
WOMAN	f	Not yet.
MATT	m	Keep going.
MATT	m	So, now that we have some distance between us- you're attracted to me, aren't you?
WOMAN	f	What?
MATT	m	Well, people say I have beautiful blue eyes.
WOMAN	f	You... you have beautiful... you have beautiful blue eyes.
MATT	m	I have brown eyes... that hurts.
MATT	m	You wanna know the good news?
WOMAN	f	What?
MATT	m	I'm going to break Anatoly's record, and I think mine's going to stand for a long, long time.
WOMAN	f	No... I'm coming to get you.
MATT	m	You know, Ryan is a nice name for a girl. Wow, you should see the sun on the Ganges. It's amazing.
WOMAN	f	(in a daze) Matt...
WOMAN	f	Matt!
WOMAN	f	Come on, come on.
WOMAN	f	OK. Where are you? Where are you? Comms. Comms... There you are!
WOMAN	f	Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
WOMAN	f	Matt. This is Ryan. Copy?
WOMAN	f	Matt, I made it. I'm here. I'm inside the Station... Do you copy?
WOMAN	f	Come on Matt. Talk to me. Tell me where you are. Give me your position...
WOMAN	f	Where are you? Give me a visual... tell me what you see.
WOMAN	f	Oh, come on. You've been yammering nonstop since we left Cape Canaveral, and now you decide to shut up?
WOMAN	f	Come on Matt, talk to me!
WOMAN	f	Say something... Anything.
WOMAN	f	Tell me about Mardi Gras. Tell me about the hairy guy. What happened?
WOMAN	f	Oh Matt. I'm not ready for this.
WOMAN	f	Houston in the blind.
WOMAN	f	This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the ISS... All communication with Mission Commander Matthew Kowalsky has been lost. Radio transmission is absent. Visual is nonexistent. To confirm, I--Ryan Stone--am the sole survivor of STS-157.
WOMAN	f	What now?
WOMAN	f	OK... where was it?... where was it?
WOMAN	f	Where is the power?... Here you are.
WOMAN	f	Good... good... just like training...
WOMAN	f	Undocking... undocking... Yes... red...
WOMAN	f	Ok... Ok... I remember this... undocking...
WOMAN	f	We don't have four minutes to spare. We're going manual...
WOMAN	f	Okay. Arming the system...
WOMAN	f	Firing the pyros...
WOMAN	f	Rezerv rasstyk!
WOMAN	f	I engaged manual control- R O A K and RYD are activated.
WOMAN	f	Oh, no. No, no, no.
WOMAN	f	Great. Fantastic. Perfect.
WOMAN	f	Clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris.
WOMAN	f	Okay. We detach this and we go home. Piece of cake.
WOMAN	f	Oh shit.
WOMAN	f	Shit!
WOMAN	f	No... no... no..
WOMAN	f	I hate space.
WOMAN	f	Shut up!
WOMAN	f	Ok.
WOMAN	f	Alright. That's good.
WOMAN	f	Okay, let's stabilise you.
WOMAN	f	Ok. Let's visit the Chinese station. Houston in the blind, Tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and I am off it's course by about 3 degrees. I will correct trajectory.
WOMAN	f	Ok.
WOMAN	f	Ok. I'll engage main thrust in five... four... three
WOMAN	f	two... one...
WOMAN	f	One...
WOMAN	f	One... one...
WOMAN	f	Come on. Come on!
WOMAN	f	You gotta be kidding me.
WOMAN	f	Where's your backup?
WOMAN	f	Where's your goddamn backup?!
WOMAN	f	This is Dr Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
WOMAN	f	Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy? Houston, this is Ryan Stone, can you hear me? Copy?
WOMAN	f	Houston. Houston! This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone. Do you copy!
WOMAN	f	(into the mouthpiece) Houston, you're coming in over the AM frequency. Please confirm identity.
TRANSMISSION	f	Han... ni... ts...
WOMAN	f	Repeat. This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone from STS-157. Do you copy?
TRANSMISSION	f	Hannik ya itc... pini.
WOMAN	f	Is this the Chinese Station? Is this Tiangong? Copy?
WOMAN	f	Do you speak English?
TRANSMISSION	f	Hannic ya itcitem pini!
WOMAN	f	S.O.S. Do you understand?
TRANSMISSION	f	Uumaruq taigaa!
WOMAN	f	Mayday! Can you copy? Mayday! Mayday!
TRANSMISSION	f	Mayday!
WOMAN	f	Yes! Mayday! Mayday!
TRANSMISSION	f	Mayday! Aningang!
WOMAN	f	Aningang?
TRANSMISSION	f	Mayday, Aningang! Aningang, Mayday!
WOMAN	f	Aningang...? (then, realizing:) Is that your name? Aningang is your name?!
TRANSMISSION	f	Aningang! Mayday! Suli, suli!
WOMAN	f	No, Mayday's not my name. I'm Stone, Dr. Ryan Stone-- I need help.
TRANSMISSION	f	Mayday! Ieukpalliktuq uumaruq taigaa naabuqtuq.
WOMAN	f	Dogs... Are those dogs? Those are dogs! Are you calling from Earth?!
WOMAN	f	Where are you, Aningang? Is the sun out? Are there birds? Are there trees? Can you smell the ocean?
TRANSMISSION	f	Ieukpalliktuq naabuqtuq.
WOMAN	f	Is it beautiful where you are? Here it's colder than hell and lonelier than shit, but it's beautiful Aningang. Utterly, terrifyingly beautiful.
WOMAN	f	Make your dogs bark again, Aningang. Will you? Please...
TRANSMISSION	f	Suli aasrivak aatqatik niuruq...?
WOMAN	f	Dogs! Woof. Woof. Woof.
TRANSMISSION	f	Auuu. Auuu. Oipmiq. Oipmiq! Auuu. Auuu.
WOMAN	f	Woof. Woof.
TRANSMISSION	f	Auuu... Auuu...
WOMAN	f	I'm going to die, Aningang.
WOMAN	f	I mean, we're all going to die. Everyone knows that. But I'm going to die today...
WOMAN	f	Funny that. To know.
WOMAN	f	And you know what Aningang... I don't care. I don't care if I die. I don't have anything... not anymore.
WOMAN	f	But the thing is... I'm still scared. I'm really scared...
WOMAN	f	No one will mourn me. No one will pray for my soul. Will you mourn me, Aningang? Is it too late to say a prayer? I'd say one for myself, but I have never prayed in my life... no one ever taught me how...
WOMAN	f	No one ever taught me how...
WOMAN	f	A baby. There's a baby with you.
TRANSMISSION	f	Ieukpalliktuq upatimi...
WOMAN	f	You are singing to your baby? Is that a lullaby? That's so sweet!
WOMAN	f	I used to sing to my baby too.
WOMAN	f	I hope I see her soon.
WOMAN	f	(growing ever drowsier) That's nice. Keep singing, Aningang, just like that. Sing me to sleep. I'll sleep and sleep and sleep. Sing to me, Aningang... sing...sing....
WOMAN	f	No... no.. don't.
MATT	m	Ahhhh! Alright, check your watch. 13 hours, 11 minutes. Call Anatoly, tell him he's been bumped.
MATT	m	Bit gloomy in here. How `bout a little light?
WOMAN	f	How did you?
MATT	m	Trust me, it's a hell of a story.
WOMAN	f	But how did you?
MATT	m	That's better.
WOMAN	f	How?
MATT	m	I found a little extra battery power. I'm just happy you're still alive. To be honest, I thought your chances were slim to none. By the way, did you find the vodka?
WOMAN	f	You never told me where.
MATT	m	Oh well... To Anatoly! Na zdorovje.
WOMAN	f	No.
MATT	m	No? Right, let's get out of here.
MATT	m	We're `bout a hundred miles to the Chinese Station. A little Sunday drive.
WOMAN	f	We can't.
MATT	m	Course we can.
WOMAN	f	There's no fuel. I tried everything.
MATT	m	Well, there's always something we can do.
WOMAN	f	I tried everything.
MATT	m	Did you try the soft landing jets?
WOMAN	f	They're for landing so.
MATT	m	Well landing is launching it's the same thing, didn't you learn about that in training?
WOMAN	f	I never got to land the simulator, I told you.
MATT	m	But you know about it.
WOMAN	f	And I crashed it every time.
MATT	m	Listen you want to go back or do you want to stay here? I get it, it's nice up here, you can just shut down all the systems turn out all the lights, and just close your eyes and tune out everybody.
MATT	m	There's nobody up here who can hurt you, it's safe. Then what's the point in going on, what's the point of living?
MATT	m	Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher than that, but still it's a matter of what you do now. If you decide to go that you've gotta just get on with it, sit back enjoy the ride. You have to start living life, Ryan.
WOMAN	f	How did you get here?
MATT	m	Ryan, you have to learn to let go ... Hey?
WOMAN	f	What?
MATT	m	It's time to go home.
WOMAN	f	Landing, landing. Landing is launching.
WOMAN	f	Okay, landing, landing, landing is green.
WOMAN	f	Okay, okay landing, alright.
WOMAN	f	Soft landing jets trigger automatically at three meters before landing. ... you're a clever son of a bitch Matt. So to land I need to get rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?
WOMAN	f	Listen to me Matt. You're going to see a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah, her hair is probably a mess. That's okay, she doesn't like to brush it.
WOMAN	f	Tell her mommy found her red shoe. She was so upset about that shoe Matt, but tell her it was right under the bed.
WOMAN	f	You give her a big hug and a kiss for me and tell her mamma misses her. Tell her she's my little angel and that she makes me so proud, so so so proud, and that I promise I'll try and make her proud too. You tell her that I'm not quitting, that I'm going to keep fighting. You tell her I love her Matt... I love her so much.
WOMAN	f	Tri module separation, go...
WOMAN	f	Okay Houston, here comes the tricky part, the Soyuz has to think we're only three meters above the earth.
WOMAN	f	Let's reset you then.
WOMAN	f	Okay. I only have one shot at this. One shot...
WOMAN	f	What's the point if we don't try?
WOMAN	f	Wow... you were right Matt... it's magnificent....
WOMAN	f	You're losing altitude, Tiangong. You keep dropping and you're going to kiss the atmosphere. But not before I get to you. You have my last ride home.
WOMAN	f	Okay, I'm done with just driving. Let's get go home.
WOMAN	f	Ahhhhhh!
WOMAN	f	Come on. Come on.
WOMAN	f	Seriously?
WOMAN	f	In the Soyuz the power button is erm....here!
WOMAN	f	Ah, ok ah undocking, undocking....eenie, meenie,...
WOMAN	f	Ok. That doesn't sound good....
WOMAN	f	Miini... moh...
WOMAN	f	No hablo chino.
WOMAN	f	Mini... moh...
WOMAN	f	Okay....okay...
WOMAN	f	Good...good...There. And this should be...
WOMAN	f	Okay... Houston in the blind...
WOMAN	f	This is Mission Specialist Ryan Stone reporting from the Shenzhou. I'm about to undock from the Tiangong and I have a bad feeling about this mission.
WOMAN	f	Reminds me of a story, Houston--
WOMAN	f	Okay, you know what, Houston? Never mind the story...
WOMAN	f	It's getting hotter in here.
WOMAN	f	The way I figure it, there's only two
WOMAN	f	I either make it down in one piece and I'll have one hell of a story to tell...
WOMAN	f	...Or I burn up in the next ten minutes.
WOMAN	f	Whichever way it goes, no harm no foul.
WOMAN	f	Because either way--
WOMAN	f	It'll be one hell of a ride.
WOMAN	f	I'm ready.
WOMAN	f	Yeehaaa!
WOMAN	f	Ahhhhhhhh!
WOMAN	f	AAAHHHHHH!
WOMAN	f	Thank you.
WOMAN	f	Ahhhhh!!!
