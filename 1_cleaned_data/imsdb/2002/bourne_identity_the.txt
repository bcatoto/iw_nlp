SAILOR #1	m	-- Jesus, look at him --
SAILOR #2	m	-- what? -- you never saw a dead man  before? --
SAILOR #3	m	-- look, look he was shot --
SAILOR #1	m	-- don't, don't do that --
SAILOR #2	m	-- he's dead, you think he cares? --
SAILOR #1	m	-- so have some respect -- it's a --
GIANCARLO	m	-- it's here -- hang on -- it's here  somewhere -- give me a minute -- get  some blankets -- get some blankets  on him -- -- here we go -- here it is --
THE CAPTAIN	m	Giancarlo. We pick him up? Okay, we have to  pick him up. But that's as far as it  goes.
GIANCARLO	m	He needs a doctor.
CAPTAIN	m	Fuck that. He lives? He dies? I don't  care. We've wasted two hours on this  shit already. You do what you can,  but we're not going back. You understand me?
GIANCARLO	m	Yes, sir.
CAPTAIN	m	Let's get back to work!
GIANCARLO	m	You're awake. Can you hear me? You've been shot. I'm trying to help  you. You were in the water. You've been  shot. It's okay now.
THE MAN	m	Where am I?
GIANCARLO	m	You're American. I thought so. From  your teeth -- the dental work --
THE MAN	m	Where am I?
GIANCARLO	m	You're on a boat. A fishing boat.  Italian flag. We're out of Vietri. It's the cold that saved you. The  water. The wounds are clean. I'm not  a doctor, but the wounds, it looks  okay. It's clean.
THE MAN	m	How did I get here?
GIANCARLO	m	You we're lost at sea. They pulled  you out. Who are you? You were shot -- two bullets -- in  the back. You understand me? Who are you?
THE MAN	m	I don't know.
THE MAN	m	What if it doesn't come back?
GIANCARLO	m	I told you. You need to rest.
THE MAN	m	I can read. I can read that sign on  the door. I can count. I can talk... What are you doing?
THE MAN	m	What is that?
GIANCARLO	m	It came from your hip. Under the  skin. You have a bank in Zurich. You remember Zurich?
THE MAN	m	No.
GIANCARLO	m	Look, I'm just on this boat, okay?  I'm an engineer. Whatever this is,  it's not for me to be involved, okay?
THE MAN	m	I don't remember Zurich.
GIANCARLO	m	You drink rum?
THE MAN	m	I don't know.
THE MAN	m	I don't know who I am. Do you know  who I am? Do have any idea who I am?
THE MAN	m	Tell me who I am. If you know who I  am, please stop fucking around and  tell me.
GIANCARLO	m	It's not much, but it should get you  to Switzerland.
THE MAN	m	I won't forget this.
TICKET AGENT	m	Una sola via?
THE MAN	m	Si. One way. Una sola via.
WOMBOSI	?	...no, no, no -- the time is not  right, my enemies are too strong.  I'm telling you to wait for this,  you understand? I'm telling you this,  and I'm making a warning to all those  peoples out there that think that my  powers have become so weak that they  can play with me as they wish. You  will see -- I will tell you when the  evidence is clear. Then you will  have a story. My old friends will  hear about themselves.
MARSHALL	m	That's Nykwana Wombosi speaking in  Paris the day before yesterday. I'm  sure most of you have a passing  knowledge of Mr. Wombosi. Some of  you on the African desks have worked  with him over the years. Some of you  very closely...
MARSHALL	m	...He was an irritation before he  took power. He was a problem when he  was in power. And he's been a disaster  for us in exile. Wombosi likes to send us messages  through the European media. This is  an interview we pulled down from a  local German television station in  Dresden. We've been getting these  little broadsides every couple of  months. He knows this -- he knows  that -- he's writing a book about  the Agency's history in Africa --  he's going to name names. It's  basically a shakedown...
MARSHALL	m	This interview -- and I'll make the  tape available for anyone who wants  it -- he goes on to claim that he  has just survived an assassination  attempt. He says it's us. He says  he's got proof. The overwhelming negative  ramifications of this should be  obvious. The Director wants to know if there  is any possible shred of truth in  this accusation.
ZURICH COP #1	m	Can't you read the signs?
ZURICH COP #2	m	On your feet. Let's go. Right now.
ZURICH COP #1	m	The park is closed. There's no  sleeping in the park.
ZURICH COP #2	m	Let's see some identification.
ZURICH COP #1	m	Come on. Your papers. Let's go.
THE MAN	m	I've lost them. I've... My papers. They are lost.
ZURICH COP #1	m	Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.
THE MAN	m	-- look, I'm just trying to sleep  okay? --
ZURICH COP #2	m	-- no -- please God no -- please  don't -- please no -- my Go
CONKLIN	?	What?
ZORN	m	Abbott wants to talk.
CONKLIN	?	Tell him we're busy.
ZORN	m	I tried.
ABBOTT	m	Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It  looks like rain and I don't have a  thing to wear.
CONKLIN	?	I don't know what we're talking about.
ABBOTT	m	We're talking about Marseille. We're  talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And  I'm asking you if this abortion in  Marseille has anything to do with  Treadstone. Was this Treadstone?
CONKLIN	?	You're asking me a direct question?
ABBOTT	m	Yes.
CONKLIN	?	I thought you were never going to do  that.
ABBOTT	m	They're putting together an agency  oversight committee. They're going  to look through everyone's budgets.  Treadstone is a rather sizable line  item in my ledger. What am I going to do about that?
CONKLIN	?	You'd want to make that go away.  You'd want to remind them that  Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical. You'd  want to sign off on that.
ABBOTT	m	And what if I couldn't do that?
CONKLIN	?	Then I'd have to explain Treadstone.  And you'd have to explain how you  let me get this far. Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B,  does it? We'll clean up the field. You clean  up your budgets.
RECEPTIONIST	m	Can I help you?
THE MAN	m	I'm here about a numbered account.
RECEPTIONIST	m	If you'll just enter your account  number here I'll direct you to the  appropriate officer.
BANK GUARD #1	m	They've been waiting your hand, sir...
APFEL	?	Good morning, sir. I assume you're  here about your box.
THE MAN	m	...yes... The box.
BOURNE	m	My name is Jason Bourne. Hi, I'm Jason. Jason Bourne. Jason  Bourne, nice to meet you.
BOURNE	m	Bourne. My name is Jason Bourne. I  live at 121, Rue de la Jardin, Paris.
BOURNE	m	I'm trying to think how long it's  been since I was here.
DEPOSIT GUARD	m	I'm not sure. Must be three weeks.
MARIE	f	-- no, this is not my current address.  It was my current address two days  ago when I started standing in line  outside --
MARIE	f	-- and so now I lost my apartment, I  have no address, and I have no visa,  and you keep telling me how much  help you cannot give me!
CLERK	m	Miss Kreutz, please... I'm gonna  have to ask you to keep your voice  down.
MARIE	f	All the papers -- all the papers  they asked for -- I brought all the  papers --
CLERK	m	Miss Kreutz, excuse me, but you  entered into a fraudulent marriage  in an effort to circumvent the  immigration laws of the United States --
MARIE	f	You only know that because I told  you! Ask the case officer -- find his  name -- it's on the papers -- I told  him all this myself! --
CLERK	m	-- it's not the source of the  information that's important here --
MARIE	f	-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid  him four thousand dollars -- my last  four thousand dollars to marry me,  okay? -- I told this to the case  officer last week... ...here -- Mr. Thomas. I told Mr.   Thomas I didn't know this guy was  already married -- I admitted this!
CLERK	m	-- Miss Kreutz, please --
MARIE	f	-- I'm the one that got ripped off! --  not you -- not the United States  government -- me -- I'm the one being  ripped off!
CLERK	m	So now you're asking for a student  visa?
CONKLIN	?	-- and they're sure it's him? --
ZORN	m	-- he accessed the account --
CONKLIN	?	-- but it was him --
ZORN	m	-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
MAN ON LINE	m	You're up.
WOMAN CLERK	f	You're a U.S. Citizen?
BOURNE	m	Yes. I mean, I think so. Yes. Yes...
WOMAN CLERK	f	Well, either you are, or you aren't.
BOURNE	m	Right.
WOMAN CLERK	f	You have your passport?
BOURNE	m	I have a passport. I've got... Actually, it's a little complicated.
WOMAN CLERK	f	Do you have your passport, sir?
BOURNE	m	Look, maybe I should just...
WOMAN CLERK	f	Sir, you waited on line.
BOURNE	m	Yeah, I know...
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- stop! -- stop right there! --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- YOU -- red bag -- the red bag --  stop right there! -- hands up! --
GUN MARINE	f	-- you heard him -- let's move it! --  down -- let's go! --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- no -- no -- hold your fire! --
SOMEONE SCREAMING	m	-- he's got a gun! -- he's got a  gun! --
THE SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- red! -- red! -- red! -- code red! --  South side entrance! -- male -- five- ten, brown hair -- black jacket --  red bag --
BUREAUCRAT #1	m	Excuse me?  Can I help you?
DEPUTY DCM	m	-- what're you talking about? --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- we're evacuating the building --
DEPUTY DCM	m	-- we're in the middle of a trade  meeting! --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- call the code! -- I want everyone  out! --
DEPUTY DCM	m	-- you gotta give me more to go on --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- he's running from the cops, he's  got a bag filled with God knows what,  he's in the building and I don't  know where! --
VOICE	m	-- no! -- the other way! -- take the  backstairs! -- the backstairs! --  he's on the other side -- there's a  bomb! --
LEAD MARINE	m	-- HALT! -- STOP WHERE YOU ARE! --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- blow it -- shoot it open! --
SECURITY CHIEF	m	-- check the closets! -- get those  back doors covered -- there's a  kitchen back there -- go! -- go! --  go!
SECURITY	m	-- we're gonna go room by room until  we find him -- so let's get teamed  up --
MARIE	f	Motherfucking sonsofbitches!
MARIE	f	What are you looking at?
BOURNE	m	I need a ride.
MARIE	f	What?
BOURNE	m	I need a ride out of here.
MARIE	f	Oh, Jesus...
BOURNE	m	Please. I don't want to scare you.
MARIE	f	It's a little late for that.
BOURNE	m	I've got a situation here and --
MARIE	f	Get the fuck away from my car.
BOURNE	m	I'll give you ten thousand dollars  to drive me to Paris.
MARIE	f	Great. You know what? I'll give you  ten gazillion dollars to get the  fuck away from me before I start  screaming my head off.
BOURNE	m	You don't want the police any more  than I do.
MARIE	f	Jesus...
BOURNE	m	Get me out of here. Please.
CONKLIN	?	go -- keep going -- go...wait --  stop -- you went past it --
CONKLIN	?	It's him. My God, it's really him...
COM TECH #2	m	-- we got a cross-ref ready to go  here, sir, we're running hotel,  airline, train, and medical variables,  anything else you'd like?
CONKLIN	?	No... Go ahead. Run it. Let's get a map, let's get a grid  map on Zurich.
ZORN	m	Sir...
CONKLIN	?	What?
ZORN	m	Zurich police are looking for an  American with a red bag. Apparently  he put two cops in the hospital last  night.
CONKLIN	?	What the fuck is he doing?
ZORN	m	Maybe it's a game. Maybe he's trying  to send us a message.
CONKLIN	?	It doesn't matter now. We've just  got to be the first ones there. Get everybody up. I want them all  activated.
ZORN	m	All of them?
CONKLIN	?	You heard me.
COM TECH #2	m	Sir, the cross-ref is coming up  cold...
MARIE	f	So what's in Paris?
BOURNE	m	I want to go home.
MARIE	f	For twenty thousand dollars.
BOURNE	m	I said ten thousand.
MARIE	f	You have blood on your pants.
BOURNE	m	Okay. Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
MARIE	f	No. No, that was too easy --
BOURNE	m	Wait up -- -- just wait up --
MARIE	f	-- get the fuck out of here -- all  this money, this crazy offer, I mean  give me a fucking break with this,  this is --
BOURNE	m	Look, I want a ride to Paris. That's all I want. I swear.
MARIE	f	You swear? That's great. I feel so much better  now.
BOURNE	m	I don't want anything but a ride.  All I want to do is go home.
MARIE	f	You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
BOURNE	m	I don't want to go alone. I want you  to drive me to Paris. Like we're a  couple. Like we're a couple and we're  travelling together. That's all we're  doing.
MARIE	f	And I don't get hurt. I get twenty  thousand dollars and I don't get  hurt.
BOURNE	m	I won't hurt you.
MARIE	f	What if I say no?
BOURNE	m	Then I'll find another ride.
MARIE	f	Just so you know, if you're gonna  burn me on the money, you might as  well kill me. I was supposed to have this car back  three days ago. It's not my car.
BOURNE	m	I know that.
MARIE	f	Shit -- Can I tell you how much you're  freaking me out? Okay? Because you  are -- you're completely freaking me  out.
BOURNE	m	I'm sorry. Really. What do you want  me to do?
MARIE	f	I don't know. Smile. Sneeze.  Something. You've got a bag full of  money and a ride to Paris. Fuck it,  I don't know... What kind of music do you like?
BOURNE	m	I don't know.
MARIE	f	What does that mean?
BOURNE	m	Listen to what you want.
MARIE	f	Who pays twenty thousand dollars for  a ride to Paris?
BOURNE	m	I don't know. I don't know who I am.
MARIE	f	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
BOURNE	m	No. No, I mean, I really don't know  who I am. I can't remember anything  earlier than two weeks ago. I'm serious.
MARIE	f	What? Like amnesia?
BOURNE	m	Look, go ahead... put the radio on...
MARIE	f	Amnesia? You're saying you don't remember  anything that happened before two  weeks ago?
BOURNE	m	That's what I'm saying.
MARIE	f	Give me a fucking break.
MORGUE BOSS	m	Okay, Monsieur Kane... number 121...
WOMBOSI	?	Get the fuck out of my way --
WOMBOSI	?	It's not him.
WOMBOSI	?	So who's crazy now?
MARIE	f	And you have no idea -- not a clue --  what came before that?
BOURNE	m	No.
MARIE	f	When you think of it, before the  ship -- before you wake up on the  ship, what do you see?
BOURNE	m	Nothing. It's just not there.
MARIE	f	Well, this is great. I'm sick of myself and you have no  idea who you are.
BOURNE	m	I kept trying things, I thought if I  could find all the things I could  do, I could --
MARIE	f	-- you could put it together --
BOURNE	m	-- which was okay for a while, I was  okay with it... But then -- there's all these other  things -- all these other things I  know how to do -- and this -- this  stuff from the bank and... I think something bad happened.
MARIE	f	What are you talking about?
BOURNE	m	I don't know.
MARIE	f	Sounds like you were in an accident  or something.
BOURNE	m	I was shot twice in the back.
MARIE	f	Okay, so you're a victim.
BOURNE	m	There was a gun. Who has a safe  deposit box with a gun and all this  money and all these passports?
MARIE	f	Lots of people have guns. You're  American. Americans love guns.
BOURNE	m	I fought my way out of an embassy.   I climbed down a fifty-foot wall --  I went out the window and I was doing  it -- I just did it. I knew how to  do it.
MARIE	f	People do amazing things when they're  scared.
BOURNE	m	Why do I? -- I come in here --  instinctively -- first thing I do --  I'm looking for the exit -- I'm  catching the sightlines -- I know I  can't sit with my back to the door --
MARIE	f	You're paranoid. You were shot. It's  natural.
BOURNE	m	I can tell you the license plate  numbers of all three cars out front.  I can tell you that the waitress is  left-handed and the guy at the counter  weighs two-hundred and fifteen pounds  and knows how to handle himself. I  know that the best, first place to  look for a gun is the cab of that  grey truck outside. I know that at  this altitude I can run flat out for  half a mile before I lose my edge. I  knew that you were my first, best  option out of Zurich? How do I know  all that? How can I know all that  and not know who I am? How is that  possible?
MARIE	f	God, you're not kidding, are you?
CONKLIN	?	And that's the best angle of the  courtyard?
RESEARCH TECH #1	m	That's the only angle.
CONKLIN	?	What do they have on the streets?  The area. They must have something.
RESEARCH TECH #1	m	Hang on...
CONKLIN	?	What?
ZORN	m	Abbott. He knows about the embassy.  He's coming down for a show and tell.
CONKLIN	?	That'll solve all our problems.
RESEARCH TECH #1	m	Sir...
CONKLIN	?	What's that?
RESEARCH TECH #1	m	It's an angle of the street -- some  sort of alleyway -- you can just...
CONKLIN	?	Enhance it.
CONKLIN	?	Who the hell is that?
MARIE	f	I needed a break.
BOURNE	m	Where are we?
MARIE	f	We're about an hour away.
BOURNE	m	I can't believe I slept.
MARIE	f	You were tired. Here... For twenty-thousand I like to throw  in breakfast. So what do you dream about?
BOURNE	m	I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm  asleep and I can't wake up. I don't think I smoke.
MARIE	f	You ever think maybe you have a  family?
BOURNE	m	I thought about it. I don't know.
MARIE	f	I guess it's like Christmas every  day for you, huh?
ABBOTT	m	Who is she?
ZORN	m	Marie Helene Kreutz. She's twenty-  six. Born outside Munich. Father was  a welder. He died in '91. We don't  have the mother. There might be a  step-sister, we're trying to track  that down. It's tough. She's a wanderer. She  pops up on the grid here and there  but... I mean, the last time she  paid an electric bill in Europe was  '94. No taxes. No steady employer.  She's got three arrests. Two  shoplifting cases, one in Spain, one  in Germany. And she actually did  three months in an Italian detention  center for credit card fraud.
ABBOTT	m	No political affiliations?
CONKLIN	?	She's a gypsy. If it's a cover, it's  a great one.
ABBOTT	m	I'm assuming we're exploring that  possibility.
CONKLIN	?	We're exploring every possibility. We are in pursuit. How much more do  you want me to tell you?
ABBOTT	m	Pursuit would indicate that you know  exactly where he is.
CONKLIN	?	No. Pursuit ends when we know exactly  where he is.
ABBOTT	m	Yes, well, I think we need some fresh  eyes on this problem. I'm bringing  in some people from upstairs.
CONKLIN	?	We've been down here for two weeks  banging our heads against the wall.  We've been sleeping down here. We  just got our first lead fourteen  hours ago, and now? -- now that we  finally have something to work with --  you want to bring planning personnel  down here? I'd rethink that.
ABBOTT	m	I want a second opinion.
CONKLIN	?	This is an operations desk.
ABBOTT	m	I'm not asking.
BOURNE	m	Slow down. No, don't stop. Just...
MARIE	f	That's it? Is that it?
BOURNE	m	Four-fifty. That's the address...
MARIE	f	Looks familiar?
BOURNE	m	No. No. Go around. Keep going...
MARIE	f	Where?
BOURNE	m	Yeah. Pull in here. Park it.
MARIE	f	So this is it, right?
BOURNE	m	I guess.
MARIE	f	I should go.
BOURNE	m	I don't remember any of this.
MARIE	f	Jason...
BOURNE	m	Sorry. The money, right?
MARIE	f	Okay, so...
BOURNE	m	Thanks for the ride.
MARIE	f	Anytime.
BOURNE	m	Look, I don't know what's up there.
MARIE	f	You got me pretty fucking curious.
BOURNE	m	Look, you could come up. Or you could  wait if you want. I could go check  it out. You could wait.
MARIE	f	Nah... With you, I mean, you'd probably  just forget about me, right?
BOURNE	m	How could I forget about you? You're the only person I know.
MARIE	f	I guess you're not home.
CONCIERGE	m	Monsieur Bourne...I'm coming...
CONCIERGE	m	Mr. Bourne, there you are -- I was  wondering -- I haven't seen you --
BOURNE	m	Here I am.
CONCIERGE	m	I've been ringing your bell. It's  good you were away. We had some  trouble with the hot water. It's  been repaired.
BOURNE	m	Great. We could use a shower. It was a long drive.
MARIE	f	It's big.
MARIE	f	This is like a real apartment. This is really yours?
BOURNE	m	I guess so.
BOURNE	m	This is my frying pan. This is my spoon. I'm Jason Bourne and this is my  kitchen.
MARIE	f	This is your office? God, you live like a monk...
BOURNE	m	All this stuff -- it's all about  boats. I think I'm in the shipping business.
MARIE	f	See. It's starting to come back,  yeah? You mind if I take a bath?
BOURNE	m	Go ahead.
PHONE MACHINE	m	"You have no messages."
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	Bonjour, Hotel Marboeuf...
BOURNE	m	...yes -- oui -- uh...
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	Yes, sir. Hotel Marboeuf, Paris.   How can I direct your call?
BOURNE	m	Paris?
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	Yes, sir... How can I help you?
BOURNE	m	Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason  Bourne.
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	One moment, please... I'm afraid, I have no one by that  name registered, sir.
BOURNE	m	D'accord... Merci. Un moment -- un moment --
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	-- sir? --
BOURNE	m	-- hang on -- I need you to check  another name for me -- hang on -- un  moment, s'il vous plait --
BOURNE	m	Kane. Do you have Mr. John Michael  Kane?
OPERATOR/PHONE	?	One moment, sir.
MANAGER/PHONE	?	Bonjour? Monsieur? Allo...
BOURNE	m	Yes, I'm here...
MANAGER/PHONE	?	You call about Monsieur Kane? John  Michael Kane?
BOURNE	m	Yes. Is he there?
MANAGER/PHONE	?	You are a friend of his?
BOURNE	m	Yes.
MANAGER/PHONE	?	I have some very bad news for you,  sir. I'm terrible sorry to have to  tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has  passed away almost two weeks ago...
MANAGER/PHONE	?	There was an accident. On the  motorway. Apparently, he was killed  instantly. Really, I'm terrible sorry  to be the one to tell you this...
BOURNE	m	...I understand...
MANAGER/PHONE	?	...we actually, we were unaware for  several days that this had happened.  When they came for his things, it  was made known for us, you see?
BOURNE	m	Who? Who came?
MANAGER/PHONE	?	His brother. You know his brother?
BOURNE	m	Right. Yes. Of course.
MANAGER/PHONE	?	It's very bad this. Terrible sad.  Such a young man.
BOURNE	m	Do you -- his brother -- do you have  a phone number?
MANAGER/PHONE	?	I think not... No, I'm sorry. It was very sudden.  He was here very briefly.
MARIE	f	She wasn't kidding about the water.  It's freezing.
BOURNE	m	Hang on. I'll check the kitchen... Maybe it takes a while to get all  the way upstairs.
BOURNE	m	Yeah, it's cold in here, too... Let's give it another minute.
MARIE	f	-- omigod! -- -- what're you? -- no -- no --
BOURNE	m	-- no -- Marie -- no! -- it's not  like that --
MARIE	f	-- please -- Jason -- omigod --
BOURNE	m	-- quiet -- quiet --
MARIE	f	...what are you doing?...
MARIE	f	omigod -- omigod -- what're you doing? --  what're you doing? -- -- what is he? -- what've you? --  omigod -- what is this? --
MARIE	f	-- what're you doing? -- Jason,  please, tell me what's happening!
BOURNE	m	Open it -- -- do it -- what's he got in there?
BOURNE	m	Who are you? -- who are you?
BOURNE	m	-- who are you? -- tell me who you  are -- who sent you? -- -- what is this about? -- YOU'VE GOT
BOURNE	m	WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME?
MARIE	f	...omigod, no...
BOURNE	m	What? -- what? -- -- what is it?
MARIE	f	...this is my picture... he's got my  picture -- -- this is me -- this is Zurich --  this... this... this is yesterday --
BOURNE	m	-- just --
MARIE	f	-- where does this come from? -- How do you have my picture?
BOURNE	m	Marie, just -- -- just stay there! -- just --
MARIE	f	-- he's got my picture! -- this is  yesterday! -- this is me! -- -- where did you get my picture? --
BOURNE	m	-- let me do this, okay? --
MARIE	f	-- do what? -- what are you doing? --  he's got my picture -- -- he's -- my God -- look at him --  he's bleeding to death -- my picture --  look! -- he was trying to kill us! --  omigod --
THE CONCIERGE	m	Mister Bourne! Mister Bourne! What's  going on? Is everything all right in  there?
THE CONCIERGE	m	--I'm calling the police, Mr.  Bourne --  you give me no choice -- I'm calling  them right away! --
BOURNE	m	-- your shoes -- Marie! -- where? --  where are your shoes? -- Marie --
MARIE	f	He's dead isn't he?
BOURNE	m	Marie -- look at me -- there's no  time for this --
MARIE	f	He went out the window -- why? --  why would someone do that?
BOURNE	m	-- we can't stay here -- I can't  stay here -- it's not safe here --
MARIE	f	He came to kill us.
BOURNE	m	-- we can go -- I can get us out of  here -- but we have to go now --
MARIE	f	You knew he was coming.
BOURNE	m	No.
MARIE	f	I trusted you.
BOURNE	m	You're wrong. I didn't know.
MARIE	f	I don't trust anybody and I trusted  you!
BOURNE	m	I didn't know this would happen.
MARIE	f	He had my picture! He knew I was  here! He came here to kill us!
BOURNE	m	And where is he now? You believe what you want, but I'm  telling you the truth -- I never  would have brought you here if I  thought it was dangerous.
MARIE	f	Oh, Jesus...
BOURNE	m	You stay -- if you want, you stay --  it's okay -- it's better -- maybe  it's better -- I don't know -- But I can't stay here. I can't.
MARIE	f	But the police --
BOURNE	m	-- there's no time --
MARIE	f	-- we'll explain it --
BOURNE	m	-- how? --
MARIE	f	-- there's two of us -- we'll tell  them -- we'll just --
BOURNE	m	-- forget it --
MARIE	f	-- we'll tell them what happened --
BOURNE	m	I don't know what happened! I don't know who he is! I don't know  what he wants! I don't even know who  I am! The only thing I know is that  if I stay here, I'm never gonna find  out!
BOURNE	m	Come with me. I can get us out of here. I know it.  Then we can think. Then we can work  it out. We'll explain it then.  Once  we're safe. I can protect you.
WOMBOSI	?	-- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this  far -- out a body in the grave --  another body! -- no! -- this isn't  over -- these people are not finished --  nothing will make them finish until  they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi --  until I'm the one in the box! --
WOMBOSI	?	-- what are you doing? -- -- sleeping? -- -- he's sleeping! -- this man is  sleeping at his post! -- -- I've had men killed for this! -- -- you think these people? -- these  people who come for me -- you think  they sleep? -- they never sleep! --  they spend all the day -- all the  night -- all time thinking about how  to put Wombosi in that box! --
WOMBOSI	?	-- there is no box for Wombosi! --  they don't have a box that can hold  me! -- I know these people -- I know  they never sleep! -- I know they  never stop! -- they never stop until  the knife is at their throat! -- -- what is the window? -- this window  is open! -- who leaves this open! -- -- this is a war, you fool! -- you  think these people are like you? --  you think this is stupid people? --  careless people? -- these people see  an open window, they reach in with a  big hand and grab your heart until  you die! --
WOMBOSI	?	-- and it won't just be me! -- they  don't just want Wombosi now! -- they  want my babies -- they want my  children! -- and I say no! -- -- you leave that window open again,  you better pray they kill me -- -- everything changes here now! --  everyone is a soldier here now! --  this is a fortress now! Are we clear  with this?
DEAUVAGE	?	Yes, sir. All clear.
WOMBOSI	?	This man is out there. Kane is out  there. And they pretend he's dead.  That means he's coming back.
BOURNE/TAPE	?	"Okay. Merci." "Un moment -- un moment --"
OPERATOR/TAPE	?	"-- sir? --"
BOURNE/TAPE	?	"-- hang on -- I need you to check  another name for me -- hang on -- un  moment, s'il vous plait --"
BOURNE/TAPE	?	"Kane. John Michael Kane."
OPERATOR/TAPE	?	"One moment, sir."
MRS. DOYLE	f	He's not lying. He's very highly  stressed, but he's not lying. He's  confused. He's aggressively searching  for a way out of the chaos. This  conversation, the video from the  consulate -- the body language, vocal  pattern -- it's my sense he's really  lost here. I think he snapped.
CONKLIN	?	Is that a medical term?
MRS. DOYLE	f	You want clinical terminology? It's  called, "conversation hysteria." I don't know exactly how you train  these people. I'm not sure I want to  know. I'll take a guess there's some  extremely rigorous behavior  modification going on here.
ABBOTT	m	Let's assume that's true.
MRS. DOYLE	f	You can only wind people so tight.  Even machines break down.
CONKLIN	?	This unit has an unblemished record  of success.
MRS. DOYLE	f	Then I guess I'm in the wrong meeting.
CONKLIN	?	That was two hours -- two hours to  get a second opinion -- and nothing  changes. He's loose. He's out of  control. It's very clear what needs  to happen. I have work to do.
ABBOTT	m	What if he is working for someone  else? What if he turned?
CONKLIN	?	Turn? To who? Where does he turn?  What does he have to offer? He's got  nothing. He's a killer. He's a piece  of equipment for crissake. Where's  he gonna turn?
BOURNE	m	No. You know who you are. You know what  that's worth? That's everything. I can't live like this. I can't do  anything until I know who I am.  Believe me, you don't want what I  have.
MARIE	f	You stayed there five times in the  past six months. But I didn't have  time -- I could only get the bill  from the last stay -- you were there  for two days. Some room service --  there's half a dozen phone calls  here so that's someth--
BOURNE	m	Who paid the bill?
MARIE	f	It's a company... MPG Capital.
MARIE	f	This can't be it.
TELEPHONE VOICE	m	Destin Navigational, can I help you?
BOURNE'S VOICE	m	Hey, how are you. I'm trying to reach  Richard? Is he there.
TELEPHONE VOICE	m	I'm afraid there's no Richard here.
BOURNE	m	Well, where are you? Where am I  calling?
TELEPHONE VOICE	m	This is an answering service, sir.  The company's located in Southampton,  but --
BOURNE	m	-- this is a tire dealership, right?
TELEPHONE VOICE	m	No sir, this is a navigational chart  registry. I'm afraid you have the  wrong number.
NEW VOICE	m	Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I  help you?
BOURNE	m	Hey, so this is the Marina, right?
NEW VOICE	m	Yes, sir. Can I help you?
BOURNE	m	This is the one in Marseille, right?
OPERATOR RECORDING	m	The number you have dialed has been  disconnected. If you think you've  reached this message in error--
RECORDED VOICE	m	"You've reached the office of Simon  Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime  Division. Paris office hours are  from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this  is an emergency, please call our  twenty-four hour help line at..."
CONKLIN	?	-- let's check that Interpol window  again --
RESEARCH TECH #1	m	-- I'm on it --
CONKLIN	?	-- I want that red car -- the girl --  we gotta get lucky here --
RESEARCH TECH #2	m	Sir. I've got a code here from NSA --  they're not gonna give us Keyhole  satellite clearance unless we have  sign-off from upstairs.
ABBOTT	m	No. We can't risk it.
CONKLIN	?	Our last sighting was forty-eight  hours ago. Even if they stayed in  the car, the grid is huge. This is it. He's trained --  conditioned -- they're built to  disappear. You give him another day  to run and we may never find him.
ABBOTT	m	This doesn't go upstairs.
RAWLINS	m	Mr. Kane... Come right in... please... have a  seat.
BOURNE	m	Thanks.
RAWLINS	m	Well... I must admit, when my assistant told  me you were here I was, really -- I  was quite -- I was surprised.
BOURNE	m	Really.
RAWLINS	m	We thought you were gone for good.
BOURNE	m	Did you?
RAWLINS	m	Well, I mean it's a tough business,  isn't it? Cutthroat.
RAWLINS	m	Look, our bid -- it was competitive --  but definitely at the high end of  competitive -- when we didn't hear  back from you, we did some re-analysis  of the numbers, and honestly, we'd  really like a chance to do a bit  better. I'm assuming you're still in the  market. It's the same vessel?
BOURNE	m	Yes.
RAWLINS	m	We just picked up a job quite like  the one we were bidding for you.  Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy-  five-foot pleasure cruiser. I think  we learned a few things that might  allow us to make our proposal for  your job, as I said, a bit more  competitive.
BOURNE	m	Okay.
RAWLINS	m	Was it the break-in?
BOURNE	m	Excuse me?
RAWLINS	m	We also thought we hadn't heard from  you -- we've had a bit of a publicity  nightmare, people have been talking. Our offices were broken into --  vandalism mostly -- shortly after we  last spoke.
BOURNE	m	I hadn't heard.
RAWLINS	m	Let me get you a new copy of the  proposal.
BOURNE	m	That'd be great.
MARIE	f	I found it. It took six calls. I found Kane. I found the body.
BOURNE	m	Let's go -- We got to get away from this phone.
ATTENDANT #1	?	What was the name again?
BOURNE	m	Kane. John Michael Kane.
ATTENDANT #2	?	It's number 121.
BOURNE	m	I want to see the body.
ATTENDANT #1	?	Our boss could come back. We're not  supposed to.
MARIE	f	What?
MORGUE BOSS	m	What the hell's going on here?
ATTENDANT #1	?	This guy, he came to see the American,  but the body, it's missing.
MORGUE BOSS	m	They came last night.  His brother.
ATTENDANT #2	?	It's not in the book.
MORGUE BOSS	m	Who are these people? Who are you? What's going on here?
BOURNE	m	Where did this body go?
MORGUE BOSS	m	I said, someone came last night -- Look, this isn't a carnival -- people  call and they make an appointment  and they follow the rules -- everyone  signs in and out -- this is a serious  place -- serious work -- it's not  just to come in whenever you like --
BOURNE	m	Shit, we didn't sign in.
MORGUE BOSS	m	So get the hell out of here.
BOURNE	m	Fine. But I'd like to sign in. In  fact, I insist on it. Where's the  book? I gotta sign in --
BOURNE	m	Is this it? -- -- this is it, right? --
MORGUE BOSS	m	-- slow down -- you can't just take  the book like that --
BOURNE	m	-- don't sweat it, I have a pen --  no problem -- just let me find the  page -- -- honey, why don't you wait for me  outside, okay? --
MORGUE BOSS	m	-- we have rules here, this is a  very serious place -- I'm the one  who decides who gets in here, okay? --
BOURNE	m	-- what do I? -- I put the name of  the person I came to see? --
MORGUE BOSS	m	-- this is serious business down  here and we cannot have people coming  and going --
BOURNE	m	-- here we go -- I found it --
MORGUE BOSS	m	-- what are you? -- what are you  doing? -- you crazy fuck -- you ripped  the book! -- you stupid fucki--
MARIE	f	What are you doing? -- -- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...
MARIE	f	-- I don't know what you're doing  and you're scaring me -- what are  you looking for? -- what just happened  in there? --
BOURNE	m	Nykwana Wombosi.
MARIE	f	What is that?
BOURNE	m	It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty  million dollar yacht. He's the proud  owner of an Alliance Security package. He also paid a visit to the morgue  to see John Michael Kane.
MARIE	f	What does that mean? Jason, what does that mean? Jason, please... who is he?
BOURNE	m	I don't know.
MARIE	f	So what are we doing?
BOURNE	m	Go back to the hotel.
ZORN	m	They found him. They found Bourne.
ABBOTT	m	Where?
ZORN	m	You better come in.
DEAUVAGE	?	Jesus fuck, what is this?
ABBOTT	m	Omigod.
CONKLIN	?	-- how long? --
COMM TECH #1	m	-- minutes -- he's close --
ABBOTT	m	-- he went inside! --
CONKLIN	?	-- if we can get a clean shot --
ABBOTT	m	-- inside the house? --
CONKLIN	?	-- that's what they're trained for --  just a surgical strike.
ABBOTT	m	Forget it.
CONKLIN	?	What do you want to do?
ABBOTT	m	We don't know what we're into!
CONKLIN	?	We're in the shitter, man! Pick your  poison. Maybe he's in there to finish  the job. Maybe he's working for  Wombosi. Maybe they want to go on TV  together. Every possibility sucks --  we've got to move!
BOURNE	m	Is he here?
CONKLIN	?	You don't have the stones for this.  You people come down here and wink  and whisper and we send these guys  out and get it done. And you're clear.  And the guys upstairs get what they  want. And the whole bunch of you are  so stuffed on deniability it's coming  out of your ears. Well, you know what? You're here  now. What do you want to do?
WOMBOSI	?	Come in. Please...
WOMBOSI	?	Did you bring investment advice for  me tonight? It was tax shelters,  wasn't it? Swiss debenture-swaps.
BOURNE	m	MPG Capital.
WOMBOSI	?	I think investment advice from a  dead man, it's a bad idea. How does it feel to be dead?
BOURNE	m	It's a lot more stressful than I  thought.
WOMBOSI	?	-- no -- no, let them in! -- let  them in. Come in -- on y va -- come in... I think everyone wants to see the  dead man.
WOMBOSI	?	What do you do? You get an appointment with me? You  make sure it's on the boat? You come  visit me -- you pitch me this bullshit  investment package. You drink my  water -- eat my bread -- play with  my children -- and what? -- two nights  later you come back and you put this  death -- -- you put this in my engine room!
WOMBOSI	?	So this is a different kind of  meeting. Maybe now we talk some truth, okay?  One dead man to another.
WOMBOSI	?	You see this? I told you my shot was better!
DEAUVAGE	?	He went in the water -- how did he  live?
WOMBOSI	?	No, no no... This is a strong killer. This is a  crazy strong killer. Oh, yeah... To make a killer that looks like  you? This young? This face? It's bloody fucking amazing.
BOURNE	m	Who do you think sent me?
WOMBOSI	?	I know who sent you. I don't know  why. I learned many, many things from the  CIA. Many things. I learned the way  they think. Was the bomb on my boat supposed to  go off or not?
WOMBOSI	?	You didn't set the bomb. Why?
WOMBOSI	?	Was this a game or a fuck up?
BOURNE	m	I don't know.
WOMBOSI	?	Get the kids out!
WOMBOSI	?	And the door.
CONKLIN	?	-- code him again -- punch it in --
COM TECH #1	m	-- he's not responding --
CONKLIN	?	-- the paging unit must be damaged --
COM TECH #2	m	-- we just ran a remote diagnostic,  sir, it's not the unit --
ABBOTT	m	What are you doing?
CONKLIN	?	I'm going to Paris.
ABBOTT	m	No you're not. You're not going  anywhere. I'm shutting this down.
CONKLIN	?	You're not doing shit. You're so  scared you can't even think.
ABBOTT	m	You just blew up a house in Paris!  This program is over. Call it off.
CONKLIN	?	I can't call it off. He's not  responding. Get out of my way.
MARIE	f	It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all  that matters. We have this money. We have what we  have. I had nothing before and now,  I don't know, maybe I have more,  maybe it's nothing, but... I say we leave here. We leave this  place. We go until we can't go  anymore.
BOURNE	m	You could do that?
MARIE	f	Yes. That's who I want to be.
CLERK	m	xxxxxx...
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx.
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	Stop where you are.
MARIE	f	What?
BOURNE	m	Where's the dog?
CLERK	m	My husband's out looking for him.
BOURNE	m	He run away often?
CLERK	m	That old beast? Miss his breakfast?  Not a chance. It's always something, right?
BOURNE	m	Get in the basement.
CLERK	m	What?
BOURNE	m	Get everyone down in the basement.
CLERK	m	What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE	m	You're in danger. All of you. I have  no time to explain.
CLERK	m	Wait a minute --
BOURNE	m	I'm sorry.
MARIE	f	Jason...
MARIE	f	Who is it? Who's out there?
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	I won't let that happen.
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	Go!
MARIE	f	Did we lose them?
MARIE	f	Who is it?
BOURNE	m	We have to keep moving.
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	What are you doing?
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	Give me the gun --
BOURNE	m	Wait 'till he's close.
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
MARIE	f	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	xxxxxx
BOURNE	m	Who else is coming?
BOURNE	m	I won't ask again.
PROFESSOR	m	I work alone. Like you... ...we always work alone.
BOURNE	m	What do you mean?
PROFESSOR	m	Who are you? Rome? Paris? Treadstone... both of us... I was  warned but...
BOURNE	m	Treadstone?
PROFESSOR	m	...which one are you?...
BOURNE	m	Paris. I live in Paris...
PROFESSOR	m	...headaches... you have that... I  get such bad headaches...
BOURNE	m	Yes.
PROFESSOR	m	...it's a problem...
BOURNE	m	Treadstone.
PROFESSOR	m	...or in a car... when it's dark...  something with the headlights... ...pills, right? Treadstone had those  pills...
BOURNE	m	What is Treadstone?
PROFESSOR	m	...what did you do?... you must've  really fucked up...
BOURNE	m	I think so.
PROFESSOR	m	...someone said caffeine -- for a  headache... doesn't seem...
BOURNE	m	What do they want me to do?
PROFESSOR	m	...they won't let you go...
BOURNE	m	Why?
PROFESSOR	m	Look at this... ...least you have a woman....
MARIE	f	Jason...
MARIE	f	We've got to go.
BOURNE	m	Take this.
BOURNE	m	Take it.
MARIE	f	And that's it?
BOURNE	m	If you're lucky. Take it. There's enough in there to make a  life. Any life. Just get out now.  Get low. Stay low. Take it.
MARIE	f	What was I thinking, right?
BOURNE	m	I can't protect you anymore.
MARIE	f	What about you?
BOURNE	m	I'm gonna find the end of this. I can't protect you.
BOURNE	m	What did you do to me?
CONKLIN	?	What did I do? What've you done? Do  you have any idea? Any conception?  What you've destroyed? Do you have  any idea how much time and work --  how many people have their lives  wrapped up in this?
BOURNE	m	Are you Treadstone?
CONKLIN	?	Am I Treadstone? Me? What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE	m	What did you do to me?
CONKLIN	?	What did I do? I spent thirty million  dollars on you. I spent three years  finding you -- four years training  you -- What did I do? What in the name of God have you  been doing, Jason?
BOURNE	m	I don't know.
CONKLIN	?	They're right about you, aren't they?  You're fried. You really don't know what's going  on, do you?
BOURNE	m	I know you've been trying to kill  me.
CONKLIN	?	Of course. We had to try. We didn't  know what was wrong. We didn't know you were in trouble.
BOURNE	m	So now you know.
CONKLIN	?	So it's time to go home.
BOURNE	m	That's all I get?
CONKLIN	?	We'll make you better. We can put  the pieces back. We can do that.
BOURNE	m	I don't think so.
CONKLIN	?	We have to go home, Jason.
BOURNE	m	Jason Bourne is dead.
CONKLIN	?	There never was a Jason Bourne. You have to come with me. It's the  only way. We can give it back to  you...
BOURNE	m	Keep it.
CONKLIN	?	Jason... They can't let you go...
BOURNE	m	That'll be their second worst mistake.
ABBOTT	m	The Treadstone project has actually  already been terminated. It was  designed primarily as a sort of  advanced game program...
ABBOTT	m	...We'd hoped it might build into a  good training platform, but quite  honestly, for a strictly theoretical  exercise, we thought it was far too  expensive. The cost-benefit ratio  was just too high. It's been all but  decommissioned at this point.
MARSHALL	m	All right, what's next?
ABBOTT	m	Okay, this is Blackbriar. Blackbriar  is a joint, DOD, communications  program that we really feel has good  traction to it.
MARIE	f	Can I help you?
BOURNE	m	This your store?
MARIE	f	Yes.
BOURNE	m	Think I could rent a scooter?
MARIE	f	You have ID?
BOURNE	m	Not really.
MARIE	f	It's not a problem.
