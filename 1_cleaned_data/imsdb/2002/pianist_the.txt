DOROTA	f	Mr. Szpilman.
SZPILMAN	m	Hello.
DOROTA	f	I came specially to meet you today.  I love your playing, but what a  day to choose.
SZPILMAN	m	Who are you?
DOROTA	f	My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's  sister. oh! You're bleeding.
SZPILMAN	m	It's nothing.
JUREK	m	C'mon, Dorota, you can write him a  fan letter later, this isn't the  best time, c'mon.
SZPILMAN	m	Jurek, why have you been hiding  her?
FATHER	m	What you think, should I take Uncle  Szymon's photograph?
MOTHER	f	Take it, don't take it, take what  you like. Can't you see I'm worried  sick?
FATHER	m	He'll come home, he'll be all right.
REGINA	f	Mama, Wladek's home.
MOTHER	f	Thank God - Wladek! You're wounded.
SZPILMAN	m	It's a little cut, nothing.
MOTHER	f	I've been worried sick.
HENRYK	m	I told her not to worry. You had  your papers on you. If you'd been  hit by a bomb, they'd have known  where to take you.
MOTHER	f	Henryk, don't say things like that,  God forbid, God forbid.
HALINA	f	Papa, Wladek's home.
FATHER	m	What did I tell you?
SZPILMAN	m	What are you doing?
REGINA	f	What's it look like we're doing?
SZPILMAN	m	They bombed us, we're off the air.
HENRYK	m	Warsaw's not the only radio station.
MOTHER	f	Pack, darling, get your things,  pack.
SZPILMAN	m	Where are we going?
MOTHER	f	Out of Warsaw.
SZPILMAN	m	Out of Warsaw. Where?
REGINA	f	You haven't heard?
SZPILMAN	m	Heard what?
REGINA	f	Haven't you seen the paper? Where's  the paper?
HALINA	f	I used it for packing.
REGINA	f	She used it for packing.
FATHER	m	The government's moved to Lublin.
HALINA	f	All able-bodied men must leave the  city, go across the river and set  up a new line of defence, that's  what it said.
FATHER	m	There's hardly anybody left in  this building, only women, the men  have gone.
SZPILMAN	m	And what do you think you'll do  while you're setting up a new line  of defence? Wander round lugging  your suitcases?
MOTHER	f	Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
SZPILMAN	m	I'm not going anywhere.
HALINA	f	Good! I'm not going anywhere either!
MOTHER	f	Don't be ridiculous, we've got to  keep together.
SZPILMAN	m	No, no, no, I'm staying put. If  I'm going to die, I prefer to die  at home.
MOTHER	f	God forbid!
HENRYK	m	Sssh!
HENRYK	m	Ssh! I've got something, listen...
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	... an important announcement.  News has just been received through  the BBC that Great Britain, having  had no reply... ...and therefore has declared war  on Nazi Germany... ... next few hours... awaiting  latest news...
RADIO ANNOUNCER	m	... but France is expected to make  a similar announcement... ... Poland is no longer alone.
HENRYK	m	Mama, that was a great dinner.
SZPILMAN	m	It certainly was.
MOTHER	f	When there's something to celebrate,  you've got to make an effort.
FATHER	m	Here's to Great Britain and France.
FATHER	m	I told you. Didn't I tell you? All  will be well.
FATHER	m	Five thousand and three.
MOTHER	f	Is that all?
FATHER	m	Yes, five thousand and three zlotys,  that's all we've got left.
REGINA	f	It's three thousand and three zlotys  too much, 'Re: Further restrictions regarding  liquid assets: Jews will be allowed  to keep a maximum of two thousand  zlotys in their homes.'
MOTHER	f	What are we supposed to do with  the rest?
HALINA	f	Deposit it in a bank. Blocked  account.
HENRYK	m	Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to  deposit money in a German bank?
REGINA	f	We could hide the money here in  the window frame.
FATHER	m	No, no, no. I'll tell you what  we'll do. We'll use tried and tested  methods. You know what we did in  the last war? We made a hole in  the table leg and we hid the money  in there.
HENRYK	m	And suppose they take the table  away?
MOTHER	f	What d'you mean, take the table  away?
HENRYK	m	The Germans go into Jewish homes  and they just take what they want,  furniture, valuables, anything.
MOTHER	f	Do they?
FATHER	m	Idiot! What would they want with a  table?
MOTHER	f	What on earth are you doing?
HALINA	f	There's a good place under the  cupboard.
HENRYK	m	No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
SZPILMAN	m	That makes a change.
HENRYK	m	You know what we do? We use  psychology.
SZPILMAN	m	We use what?
HENRYK	m	We leave the money and the watch  on the table. And we cover it like  this. In full view. The Germans will  search high and low, I promise  you, they'll never notice it.
SZPILMAN	m	Of course they'll notice it. But  look-- This is a good place for something.
HENRYK	m	A good place for what? He's insane!
SZPILMAN	m	Just shut up.
FATHER	m	My violin?
REGINA	f	Quiet! Quiet! Order, please, order!
HALINA	f	She's a lawyer, she likes order.
REGINA	f	Listen, just listen. Let's come to  an agreement. We jam the money in  the window frame. The watch we  hide under the cupboard. And the  chain we put in the violin.
FATHER	m	Will I still be able to play?
SZPILMAN	m	Let's find out.
SZPILMAN	m	Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
JUREK	m	Wladek! How are you?
SZPILMAN	m	Fine, we're fine, thank you, and  you?
JUREK	m	Fine, we're fine in the  circumstances. But I can guess  what you've called about. There's  nothing we can do; they won't reopen  the station--
SZPILMAN	m	Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
JUREK	m	...not even music, nothing, no  radios for the Poles. But I'm sure  you'll find work, Wladek, a pianist  like you.
SZPILMAN	m	Maybe, maybe not, but, Jurek, don't  be offended, I didn't call to  discuss my future career.
DOROTA	f	I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.  And at last he gave in and said,  'All right, come with me tomorrow,'  and so I came and they bombed the  station.
SZPILMAN	m	You know something? Meeting you  like that was absolutely wonderful.
DOROTA	f	Really?
SZPILMAN	m	Yes! It was...it was unforgettable.
DOROTA	f	I've always loved your playing,  Mr. Szpilman.
SZPILMAN	m	Wladek, please.
DOROTA	f	No one plays Chopin like you.
SZPILMAN	m	I could accompany you, me on the  piano, you on the cello.
DOROTA	f	Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite...  quite wonderful.
SZPILMAN	m	Wladek, please.
FATHER	m	'Re: emblems for Jews in the Warsaw  District. I hereby order that all  Jews in the Warsaw District will  wear visible emblems when out of  doors. This decree will come into  force on the 1st December 1939 and  applies to all Jews over twelve  years of age. The emblem will  be worn on the right sleeve and  will represent a blue Star of David  on a white background. The  background must be sufficiently  large for the Star to measure eight  centimetres from point to point.  The width of the arms of the Star must be one centimetre. Jews who  do not respect this decree will be  severely punished. Governor of  Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer.'
HENRYK	m	I won't wear it.
REGINA	f	won't wear it. I'm not going to be  branded.
SZPILMAN	m	Let me see this.
FATHER	m	Doesn't it say we have to provide  these armbands ourselves? Where  will we get them?
HENRYK	m	We're not going to get them. We're  not going to wear them!
GERMAN OFFICER	m	You!
GERMAN OFFICER	m	Why didn't you bow?
FATHER	m	I'm sorry I...
GERMAN OFFICER	m	You are forbidden to walk on the  pavement. Walk in the gutter!
HALINA	f	Have you seen this?
SZPILMAN	m	What, I'm working, what?
SZPILMAN'S VOICE	m	What is it?
HALINA'S VOICE	m	That's where they're going to put  us.
SZPILMAN'S VOICE	m	What d'you mean, put us?
HALINA	f	'By order of the Governor of the  Warsaw District, Dr. Fischer,  concerning the establishment of  the Jewish District in Warsaw.  There will be created a Jewish  District in which all Jews living  in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will  have to reside."  And look here:  'Jews living outside of the  prescribed area will have to move  to the Jewish district by 31st of  October 1940.'
SZPILMAN	m	But...they won't get all of us...  we'll...it's too small...there's  four hundred thousand of us in  Warsaw!
HENRYK	m	No. Three hundred and sixty  thousand, so it'll be easy.
HALINA	f	Mama, what is it?
MOTHER	f	Twenty zlotys. That's all we've  got left. What can I buy with twenty  zlotys? I'm sick of cooking potatoes,  potatoes, potatoes.
MR LIPA	m	That's the price. That's what I'm  offering. And my advice is to  accept. You won't get more from  anyone else.
REGINA	f	But...but it's a Steinway, Mr  Lipa...
MR LIPA	m	Two thousand. My advice is to take  it. What you going to do when you're  hungry? Eat the piano?
HENRYK	m	Get out! You're a thieving bastard,  we don't want your money, get out!  We'd rather give it away! Get out!
MR LIPA	m	Hey! Hey! What's the matter with  you? Haven't you eaten today, what  you suffering from? Hey!
REGINA	f	Henryk, stop it, leave him alone.
MR LIPA	m	You people are crazy! I'm doing  you a favour, two thousand, and  I'm paying for the removal, I'm  not even charging for the removal.
MR LIPA	m	You haven't eaten today, you're  crazy...
SZPILMAN	m	Take it.
SZPILMAN	m	Dorota!
DOROTA	f	I didn't want to come, I didn't  want to see all this, but I couldn't  stop myself.
SZPILMAN	m	How are you doing?
DOROTA	f	Fine, no, not really, they arrested  my cousin, but Jurek says they'll  let him out. This is disgraceful.
SZPILMAN	m	Don't worry, it won't last long.
DOROTA	f	That's what I said, it's so - it's  too absurd!
SZPILMAN	m	I'll see you...soon.
FATHER	m	To tell you the truth, I thought  it would be worse.
SZPILMAN	m	How will we sleep?
MOTHER	f	I'll sleep with the girls in the  kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in  here.
HALINA	f	Look! Come and look!
SZPILMAN	m	You sell anything?
HENRYK	m	Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot.  Three zlotys.
SZPILMAN	m	That's better than yesterday.
HENRYK	m	Three lousy zlotys. And there are  people here making millions.
SZPILMAN	m	I know.
HENRYK	m	You don't know, believe me. They  bribe the guards. The guards turn  a blind eye. They're bringing in  cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor,  French cosmetics, and the poor are  dying all around them and they  don't give a damn.
THE FEATHER WOMAN	f	Excuse me, but have you by any  chance seen my husband Izaak  Szerman?
SZPILMAN	m	I'm afraid not.
THE FEATHER WOMAN	f	A tall handsome man with a little  grey beard?
THE FEATHER WOMAN	f	No? Oh, do forgive me. Goodbye, sleep well, if you see  him, please do write, Izaak  Szerman's his name...
HENRYK	m	Sometimes I wish I could go mad.
THE NERVOUS MAN	m	This is totally insane; why do we  have to have a gentile street  running through our area? Can't  they go around?
HENRYK	m	Don't worry about it, they're about  to build a bridge, haven't you  heard?
THE NERVOUS MAN	m	A bridge, a schmidge, and the  Germans claim to be intelligent.  You know what I think?  I think  they're totally stupid. I've got a  family to feed and I spend half my  time here waiting for them to let  us through.
THE GERMAN SOLDIER	m	Dance!
SOLDIERS	m	Faster! Go on, faster! Dance!
SOLDIERS	m	Dance! Dance!
MOTHER	f	Good, they're here. Yitzchak  Heller's been waiting for you,  Henryk.
HENRYK	m	What's this about?
MOTHER	f	Sit down, have tea, I'll start  lunch when the girls get back.
HENRYK	m	So, what are you doing here?
FATHER	m	He brought cakes.
FATHER	m	His father's back in the jewellery  business and doing well, isn't  that so, Yitzchak? Amazing.   Jewellery.
HELLER	m	We're recruiting.
HENRYK	m	Who's recruiting?
HELLER	m	Don't be clever with me, Henryk.  I've come here as a friend. They're  bringing Jews in from all over the  country. Soon there'll be half a  million people in the ghetto. We  need more Jewish police...
HENRYK	m	Oh? More Jewish police? You mean  you want me to wear a cap like  yours, beat up Jews with my  truncheon and catch the Gestapo  spirit. I see!
HELLER	m	Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
HENRYK	m	But why me? I thought you only  recruited boys with rich fathers.  Look at my father, look at us, I  mean...
HELLER	m	Yes, I'm looking at you and that's  why I'm here. Your whole family  can have a better life. You want  to go on struggling for survival,  selling books on the street?
HENRYK	m	Yes, please.
HELLER	m	I'm doing you people a favour. And  what about you, Wladek? You're a  great pianist. And we've got an  excellent police jazz band. They'd  welcome you with open arms. Join  us. You've got no work...
SZPILMAN	m	Thank you. But I've got work.
BENEK	m	I'm sorry, Mr Wladek, he wants you  to stop.
SZPILMAN	m	Who wants me to stop?
2ND CHILD	m	Help me! help me!
JEHUDA	m	I always say look on the bright  side. You're in the small ghetto,  intellectuals, professional people,  you're better off than us. Here,  in the large ghetto, it's a  cesspool. But you, you're living  in Monte Carlo. You could say you're  privileged and that, of course,  goes against my principles.   Nevertheless...
JEHUDA	m	Ah, here. Today's news from the  other side.
SZPILMAN	m	You're amazing, Jehuda.
JEHUDA	m	No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers  everywhere. They bring me news and  food. We care about our fellow  human beings. Workers of the world  unite.
SZPILMAN	m	So, what's the news?
JEHUDA	m	The Germans are advancing on  Kharkhov.
SZPILMAN	m	I don't know why I come here every  evening, it's always such bad news.
JEHUDA	m	Bad news, you crazy? You have no  world view, Wladek, that's your  trouble. The news couldn't be  better. The moment Hitler invaded  Russia, I knew we'd be all right.  Remember Napoleon. Same business.  The Germans will freeze to death,  please God.
SZPILMAN	m	Jehuda, give me something to do.
JEHUDA	m	You're an artist, Wladek, you keep  people's spirits up. You do enough.
SZPILMAN	m	But I want to help, I want to.
JEHUDA	m	You're too well known, Wladek. And  you know what? You musicians don't  make good conspirators. You're  too...too musical.
SZPILMAN	m	There are notices going up. The  city's to be cleansed of  undesirables.
JEHUDA	m	There are always notices going up.
MAJOREK	?	Hello, Symche, Dolek, Mrs Zyskind,  Jehuda. Working hard?
JEHUDA	m	Majorek, this is the greatest  pianist in Poland, maybe in the  whole world. Wladyslaw Szpilman.  Meet Majorek.
MAJOREK	?	I know your name. I've never heard  you play.
JEHUDA	m	Majorek used to be in the army.  Brilliant man. He's got a mind  like a searchlight. The only thing  I've got against him is he's not a  socialist. You'd better go now, Wladek. It's  nearly curfew. You see these, Wladek?  You know  how many copies we print of our  newspaper?
JEHUDA	m	Five hundred. You know how many  people on average read one copy?   Twenty.  That makes ten thousand  readers. These will start the  uprising. Majorek hides them in  his underpants. And leaves them in  toilets.
SZPILMAN	m	Toilets?
MAJOREK	?	As many toilets as I can find.  Germans never go into Jewish  toilets. They're too clean for  them.
MOTHER	f	And, please, tonight, for once, I  don't want anything bad talked  about. Let's enjoy our meal.
HENRYK	m	Okay, then I'll tell you something  funny. You know who I mean by Dr.  Raszeja.
REGINA	f	The surgeon?
HENRYK	m	The surgeon. Well, for some reason,  don't ask me why, the Germans  allowed him into the ghetto to  perform an operation...
HALINA	f	On a Jew? They allowed a Pole to  come in to operate on a Jew?
HENRYK	m	He got a pass, that's all I know.  Anyway, he puts the patient to  sleep and starts the operation.  He'd just made the first incision  when the SS burst in, shoot the  patient lying on the table, and  then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody  else who was there. Isn't that a  laugh? The patient didn't feel a  thing, he was anaesthetised -
MOTHER	f	Henryk, I said nothing bad.
HENRYK	m	What's the matter with you all?  Have you lost your sense of humour?
SZPILMAN	m	It's not funny.
HENRYK	m	Well, you know what's funny? You're  funny with that ridiculous tie.
SZPILMAN	m	What are you talking about, my  tie? What's my tie got to do with  anything? I need the tie for my  work.
MOTHER	f	Boys, boys...
HENRYK	m	Your work, yes, playing the piano  for all the parasites in the ghetto,  they don't give a damn about  people's sufferings, they don't  even notice what's going on around  them!
FATHER	m	I blame the Americans.
SZPILMAN	m	For what? For my tie?
FATHER	m	American Jews, and there's lots of  them, what have they done for us?  What do they think they're doing?  People here are dying, haven't got  a bite to eat. The Jewish bankers  over there should be persuading  America to declare war on Germany!
NCO	m	Stand up!
NCO	m	Stand up!
REGINA	f	Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be  quiet!
A GERMAN VOICE	m	Run!  Run!
SZPILMAN	m	What's happened?
HALINA	f	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've  got to do something, oh my God!
SZPILMAN	m	Calm down, what, what is it?
HALINA	f	They're hunting people on the  streets. They've picked up Henryk.
THE FEATHER WOMAN	f	Excuse me, but have you seen my  husband Izaak Szerman?
SZPILMAN	m	I'm afraid not.
THE FEATHER WOMAN	f	He's tall, he's handsome. He has a  little grey beard. If you see him,  please do write, Izaak Szerman's  his name, don't forget.
SZPILMAN	m	What's happening?
THE ELDERLY MAN	m	They've got my grandson in there.  They pick 'em up, they take 'em  away. What do they do to them?  I've stopped believing in God!
SZPILMAN	m	Yitzchak!
SZPILMAN	m	Yitzchak!
SZPILMAN	m	Here, please! Wladek Szpilman!
SZPILMAN	m	Henryk's in there.
HELLER	m	I haven't seen him.
SZPILMAN	m	Believe me, they've picked him up.
HELLER	m	Tough luck.
SZPILMAN	m	Can you help?
HELLER	m	Oh, you need me now, yes, now you  need me!
SZPILMAN	m	Can you help us?
HELLER	m	It costs.
SZPILMAN	m	I've no money.
HELLER	m	Then there's nothing I can do. He  should've joined us when I gave  him the chance..
SZPILMAN	m	Yitzchak, they told me you had  influence.
HELLER	m	Who told you?
SZPILMAN	m	People I know. They said you're an  important man.
POOR WOMAN	f	A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher!
RUBINSTEIN'S VOICE	m	Boys, keep your peckers up! And  girls, keep your legs crossed!
RUBINSTEIN	m	Don't let 'em get you down -
RUBINSTEIN	m	Bandits! Crooks!  Thieves!
1ST SHUPO	m	Good day, Herr Rubinstein.
RUBINSTEIN	m	If that means good day, I'm your  man, you gangsters, robbers,  pirates!
2ND SHUPO	m	Mad!
RUBINSTEIN	m	Ich bin meshuge, you bandit!
HENRYK	m	You go to Heller, did I ask you to  talk to him?
SZPILMAN	m	You're out, aren't you?
HENRYK	m	Did you beg, did you grovel to  that piece of shit, that cockroach?
SZPILMAN	m	I didn't grovel, I asked him to  help.
HENRYK	m	What did you pay him?
SZPILMAN	m	Pay him? With what? With what could  I pay him? Every zloty I earn we  spend on food!
HENRYK	m	I can look after myself!
SZPILMAN	m	They were taking you away.
HENRYK	m	It's nothing to do with you. It's  me they wanted, not you. Why do  you interfere in other people's  business?
SZPILMAN	m	You're mad, that's your trouble,  you're mad.
HENRYK	m	That's also my business.
SZPILMAN	m	What's the matter? Are you sick?
HENRYK	m	Hungry.
SZPILMAN	m	What's that mean, no employment  certificate?
HENRYK	m	You have to have an employment  certificate to work for one of the  German firms in the ghetto,  otherwise...
SZPILMAN	m	Otherwise what?
HENRYK	m	You'll be deported.
BENEK	m	So the rumours were true...
HENRYK	m	They're going to resettle us. Send  us to labour camps. In the east.  And they're closing the small  ghetto.
JEHUDA	m	Wladek!
JEHUDA	m	I thought you'd be off on tour,  playing London, Paris, New York?
SZPILMAN	m	Not this week.
JEHUDA	m	I have to say you look terrible.  What's the trouble?
SZPILMAN	m	You've heard the rumours they're  going to resettle us in the East?
JEHUDA	m	Rumours, rumours, you take it all  too much to heart, Wladek.
SZPILMAN	m	I've been trying to get a  certificate of employment for my  father. I've managed to get  certificates for me and the rest  of the family but I need one more  for my father. I've been trying  all the firms, the shops...
JEHUDA	m	Why didn't you come to me?
SZPILMAN	m	I didn't know you were in the  certificate business.
JEHUDA	m	I'm not, but Majorek is.
SZPILMAN	m	Can you help? I've no money...
JEHUDA	m	Please, don't insult us. Can you do something for him?
MAJOREK	?	Be at the Schultz Workshop,  tomorrow, four o'clock.
JEHUDA	m	You see what a wonderful piece of  luck you've had today? That's die  historical imperative in action  and that's why I always say, look  on...
SZPILMAN	m	...the bright side, yes, I know.
FATHER	m	Thank you.
SCHULTZ	m	My pleasure. It won't help you  anyway.
FATHER	m	At least we've got work in the  ghetto. At least we're still  together.
NCO	m	Out! Assemble in the yard!
SZPILMAN	m	We're employed here, we've got  certificates -
NCO	m	The rest of you get dressed then  report back here. Bring your  belongings. Fifteen kilos only.
A YOUNG WOMAN	f	Where are you taking us?
SZPILMAN	m	I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought  the certificates would save us  all.
MOTHER	f	Stop it, Wladek.
REGINA	f	Let's just hope that Henryk and  Halina will be better off -
REGINA	f	Where will we be going?
JEWISH POLICEMAN #1	m	You're going to work. You'll be  much better off than in this  stinking ghetto. The gates are
JEWISH POLICEMAN #2	m	Move!
SZPILMAN	m	Let's sit over there.
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
WOMAN WITH CHILD	f	He's dying, don't you have a drop  of water? My child's dying of  thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I  beg you!
A MAN'S VOICE	m	I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
FATHER	m	I can hear you.
DR. EHRLICH	m	We're letting them take us to our  death like sheep to the slaughter!
FATHER	m	Dr. Ehrlich, not so loud!
DR. EHRLICH	m	Why don't we attack them? There's  half a million of us, we could  break out of the ghetto. At least  we could die honourably, not as a  stain on the face of history!
GRUN	m	Why you so sure they're sending us  to our death?
DR. EHRLICH	m	I'm not sure. You know why I'm not  sure? Because they didn't tell me.  But I'm telling you they plan to  wipe us all out!
FATHER	m	Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me  to do? You want me to fight?
GRUN	m	To fight you need organisation,  plans, guns!
FATHER	m	He's right. What d'you think I can  do? Fight them with my violin bow?
GRUN	m	The Germans would never squander a  huge labour force like this. They're  sending us to a labour camp.
DR. EHRLICH	m	Oh, sure. Look at that cripple,  look at those old people, the  children, they're going to work?  Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's  going to carry iron girders on his  back?
MOTHER	f	Henryk!
REGINA	f	Oh my God!
MOTHER	f	Halina! Henryk!
HALINA	f	We heard you were here...we...didn't  want...we...we wanted to be with  you.
SZPILMAN	m	Stupid, stupid!
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
HALINA	f	She's getting on my nerves. What  did she do, for God's sake?
GRUN	m	She smothered her baby.
GRUN	m	They'd prepared a hiding place and  so, of course, they went there.  But the baby cried just as the  police came. She smothered the  cries with her hands. The baby  died. A policeman heard the death  rattle. He found where they were  hiding.
SZPILMAN	m	What are you reading?
HENRYK	m	'If you prick us, do we not bleed?  If you tickle us, do we not laugh?  If you poison us, do we not die?  And if you wrong us, shall we not  revenge?'
SZPILMAN	m	Very appropriate.
HENRYK	m	Yes, that's why I brought it.
HENRYK	m	Idiot. What's he think he's going  to do with the money?
FATHER	m	How much for a caramel?
THE SWEET BOY	m	Twenty zlotys.
FATHER	m	What? For one caramel? What d'you  think you're going to do with the  money?
THE SWEET BOY	m	Twenty zlotys.
FATHER	m	Have we got twenty between us?
SZPILMAN	m	Halina?
HALINA	f	What?
SZPILMAN	m	Funny time to say this.
HALINA	f	What?
SZPILMAN	m	wish I knew you better.
HALINA	f	Thanks.
A VOICE	m	Szpilman! Szpilman!
SZPILMAN	m	Papa!
SZPILMAN	m	Papa! Mama! Halina!
HELLER	m	What do you think you're doing,  Szpilman? I've saved your life!  Now, go on, save yourself!
HELLER	m	Don't run!
JEWISH POLICEMAN	m	Well, off they go for meltdown!
BENEK	m	Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
SZPILMAN	m	It's like this... I...we...all of  them.
BENEK	m	Perhaps they're lucky. The quicker  the better. It isn't over yet. We'll stay here  for a couple of days. Until things  die down. I've bribed a policeman. He'll  come when it's over.
SZPILMAN	m	My God. I haven't been outside for -  it must be two years.
FELLOW WORKER	m	Don't get over-excited.
DEALERS	?	Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles!
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Look - oh, do look!
THE YOUNG WOMAN	f	Jews!
THE YOUNG MAN	m	Can't be the first time you've  ever seen Jews.
BENEK	m	Someone you know?
SZPILMAN	m	Yes.
BENEK	m	A beauty. Who is she?
SZPILMAN	m	A singer. Her husband's an actor.  I knew them well. Good people. I'd  like to talk to her.
BENEK	m	Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they  hang them for helping Jews.
YOUNG SS MAN	m	Halt!
YOUNG SS MAN	m	Lie down!
SZPILMAN	m	How long have you been here?
MAJOREK	?	Since last night. I was pleased to  see you.
MAJOREK	?	They're going to start the final  resettlement now. We know what it  means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt.  A good man. His orders were to  follow the trains out of Warsaw.  He got to Sokolow. A local  railwayman told him the tracks are  divided, one branch leading to  Treblinka. He said every day freight  trains carrying people from Warsaw  forked to Treblinka and returned  empty. No transports of food are  ever seen on that line. And  civilians are forbidden to approach  the Treblinka station. They're  exterminating us. Won't take them  long. We're sixty thousand left.  Out of half a million. Mostly young  people. And this time we're going  to fight. We're in good shape.  We're organised. We're prepared.
SZPILMAN	m	If you need help...
ZICK-ZACK	?	You!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Here!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und- zack!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Get him away from here.
BARTCZAK	m	Hope you played the piano better  than you carry bricks.
POLISH WORKMAN	m	He won't last long if he goes on  like this.
BARTCZAK	m	I'll see if I can get him something  better.
WORKER	m	Trouble.
A GERMAN VOICE	m	Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!  Poles go on working! Only the Jews!  Poles go on working!
SS CAPTAIN	m	I have important and good news for  you. There are rumours circulating  that resettlement measures are  again going to be taken.
SS CAPTAIN	m	I want to assure you personally  that no such measures will be taken  now or in the future. Posters will  be going up also to this effect.  As proof of our good will, we want  you to select a delegate, who will  be permitted to go into town once  a day to buy, on each worker's  behalf, five kilos of potatoes and  one loaf of bread, which you will  be allowed to take back into the  ghetto. Now, why would we do that  j if we meant to resettle you?
SS CAPTAIN	m	You can do good business on what  you don't eat. Isn't that what you  Jews are best at? Making 'geld'?
SS CAPTAIN	m	Carry on.
MAJOREK	?	The smaller one. At the bottom.
SZPILMAN	m	Majorek!
SZPILMAN	m	Have a favour to ask. I want to  get out of here.
MAJOREK	?	It's easy to get out, it's how you  survive on the other side that's  hard.
SZPILMAN	m	I know. But last summer, I worked  for a day in Zelazna Brama Square.  I saw someone I knew. A singer.  Her husband's an actor. They're  old friends. ( I've written their names down. And  their address. If they're still  there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej  Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you  go into the town every day. Would  you try and make contact? Ask them  if they'd help me get out of here?
SS LIEUTENANT	m	Any fucking plaster?
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE	m	What were you up to?
SS LIEUTENANT'S VOICE	m	What the fuck are those?
SZPILMAN	m	We're allowed to take food into  the ghetto. Five kilos of potatoes  and a...
SS LIEUTENANT	m	Open it.
SZPILMAN	m	It's only potatoes and bread.
SS LIEUTENANT	m	Fuck that, you're lying, I can  smell it. Open it.
SS LIEUTENANT	m	You're all the same. Give a Jew a  little finger, he takes the whole  hand.
SS LIEUTENANT	m	You lie to me again and I'll shoot  you personally.
MAJOREK	?	I tried your friends. They're not  at that address any more.  But.
SZPILMAN	m	You made contact?
MAJOREK	?	Be ready to leave in two days'  time. Same place as last night.
SZPILMAN	m	Oh, shit!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Und-zick! Und-zack!
ZICK-ZACK	?	I'll soon teach you discipline!  Jew pigs!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Know why we beat you?
ZICK-ZACK	?	Know why we beat you?
SZPILMAN	m	No. Why?
ZICK-ZACK	?	To celebrate New Year's Eve!
ZICK-ZACK	?	Now, march! Go on, march!
ZICK-ZACK	?	And sing! Sing something cheerful! And sing it good and loud!
ALL WORKERS	m	Hey, ranks unite  And follow the White Eagle!  Stand up and fight  Our mortal enemy. Riflemen, hey! Let's give them fire and brimstone. We'll blow away  The yoke of slavery. Punish and rout  The rapists of our nation. We'll smash the knout  To save our dignity. Soon we'll be proud Of our liberation -
GERMAN VOICES	m	Get on with it and fall in! Fall  in!
BOGUCKI	?	We haven't much time.
BOGUCKI	?	You must hurry.
BOGUCKI	?	We're going to have to keep moving  you. The Germans are hunting down  indiscriminately now. Jews, non- Jews, anybody, everybody. See if these fit. And, Wladek,  you'd better shave. Use my razor.  In the cabinet.
SZPILMAN	m	Thank you, I don't.
BOGUCKI	?	You'll be looked after by Mr  Gebczynski. He's on the other side  of town. You'll stay there tonight.  Then we'll find you somewhere else.
JANINA	f	I'll bring you food.
BOGUCKI	?	Let's go.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	I'll show you where you're going  to sleep.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	It's not going to be very  comfortable.
SZPILMAN	m	I'll be fine.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	You'll have to stay here until  tomorrow afternoon.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	We've got a flat for you. Near the  ghetto wall. But it's safe.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	Go as near to the front as possible,  to the German section.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	Must feel better this side of the  wall.
SZPILMAN	m	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not  sure which side of the wall I'm  on.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	Here.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki  will visit twice a week. Bring  more food. See how you are.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	Yes, now, this is very important.  In case of emergency, I mean  emergency, go to this address.
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Puppydog, what d'you mean, you  forgot?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I  forgot, that's what I mean.
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	You know what? You treat me like  dirt!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	I treat you like dirt because you  are dirt.
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	Cow!
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	Bitch!
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Dirty pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	You're a dirty pig!
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Takes one to know one! Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	You play like an angel, Kitten.
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	If I play like an angel, why don't  you listen?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	I was listening, Kitten.
KITTEN'S VOICE	m	Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE	m	Kitten, let me in.
JANINA	f	wanted to come earlier but...
SZPILMAN	m	Thank you.
JANINA	f	No one thought they'd hold out so  long.
SZPILMAN	m	should never have come out. I  should've stayed there, fought  with them.
JANINA	f	Wladek, stop that. It's over now.  Just be proud it happened. My God,  did they put up a fight.
SZPILMAN	m	Yes, so did the Germans.
JANINA	f	They're in shock. They didn't expect  it. Nobody expected it. Jews  fighting back? Who'd have thought?
SZPILMAN	m	Yes, but what good did it do?
JANINA	f	What good? Wladek, I'm surprised  at you. They died with  dignity,  that's what good it did. And you  know something else?  Now the Poles  will rise. We're ready. We'll fight,  too. You'll see.
GEBCZYNSKI	?	Get your things together, you have  to leave!
SZPILMAN	m	What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI	?	I'm on the run!
SZPILMAN	m	What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI	?	The Gestapo found our weapons.  They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.  They're bound to find out about  this place, too - you must get  away at once.
SZPILMAN	m	Where do you want me to go?  Look  at me. No, no, I'm not leaving.  Can't I take my chances here?
GEBCZYNSKI	?	That's your decision. But when they storm the flat, throw  yourself out of die window - don't  let them get you alive. I have  poison on me, they won't get me  alive either!
KITTY'S VOICE	f	Open this door at once, or we'll  call the police!
KITTY	f	Are you from the flat in there?  You're not registered.
SZPILMAN	m	It belongs to a friend of mine. I  came to visit but I must have just  missed him.
KITTY	f	Have you got your identity card?  Let me see your identity card!
KITTY	f	I want to see your identity card!
KITTY	f	He's a Jew! He's a Jew! Stop the  Jew! Don't let him out!
WOMAN'S VOICE	f	Yes?
SZPILMAN	m	Mr Gebczynski sent me.
DOROTA	f	Wladyslaw Szpilman.
SZPILMAN	m	Dorota.
DOROTA	f	Come in! come in!
DOROTA	f	Sit.
SZPILMAN	m	I'm sorry - I was given this  address. I'm looking for a Mr-- -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
DOROTA	f	Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
SZPILMAN	m	I need help.
DOROTA	f	He'll be back before curfew.
SZPILMAN	m	I've been in hiding. I need  somewhere to stay.
DOROTA	f	He'll be here soon.
SZPILMAN	m	How long have you been married?
DOROTA	f	Just over a year.
SZPILMAN	m	And how's Yurek?
DOROTA	f	Dead.
SZPILMAN	m	When's your baby due?
DOROTA	f	Christmas. This is not a good time to have  children. But then...
DOROTA	f	This is my husband. Wladyslaw  Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent  him.
MICHAL	m	Oh, yes. I remember.
SZPILMAN	m	Mr Gebczynski said to contact you  only in an emergency, but...
MICHAL	m	Don't worry now. We can't move you  tonight.
MICHAL	m	You'll sleep on the sofa.
SZPILMAN	m	Excuse me, could I have a piece of  bread?
MICHAL	m	Yes, of course, we'll eat.
MICHAL	m	You're in a very German area. The  building opposite is a hospital,  taking in wounded from the Russian  front. Next door is the  Schutzpolizei. It's the safest  place to be. Right in the centre  of the lion's den.
MICHAL	m	I'll be locking you in. No one  knows you're here. So keep as quiet  as possible.
MICHAL	m	All well?
SZPILMAN	m	Thank you.
MICHAL	m	This is Antek Szalas.
MICHAL	m	He's going to look after you. I've  given him a second key. He'll bring  you food. See that you're all right.  He's with the underground, a good  man.
SZALAS	m	You don't remember me, Mr. Szpilman?
SZPILMAN	m	No, I don't think so?
SZALAS	m	Warsaw Radio. I was a technician.  I saw you almost every day.
SZPILMAN	m	Sorry, I don't remember.
SZALAS	m	Doesn't matter. You've nothing to  worry about. I'll visit often.
MICHAL	m	And you'll be pleased to hear the  Allies are bombing Germany night  after night - Cologne, Hamburg,  Berlin.
SZALAS	m	And the Russians are really giving  them hell. It's the beginning of  the end.
MICHAL	m	Let's hope so. I don't know when  I'll see you again?
SZALAS	m	Still alive then, are you? Here.  Sausage. Bread.
SZPILMAN	m	How long is this meant to last?
SZPILMAN	m	think I've got jaundice.
SZALAS	m	You don't want to worry about that.  My grandfather was jilted by his  girl friend when he got jaundice. In my opinion, jaundice is not  very serious. Drink up.
SZPILMAN	m	Why didn't you come sooner? It's  been over two weeks.
SZALAS	m	Problems. Money. I've got to raise  money to buy the food. I need things  to sell, it' s not easy.
SZPILMAN	m	Sell this. Food's more important  than time.
SZALAS	m	Oh, yes. I meant to tell you. The  Allies have landed in France. The  Russians'll be here soon. They'll  beat the shit out of the Germans.  Any day now.
DOROTA	f	Wladek? Wladek! I knew it, I knew this would happen!
DOROTA	f	I'm going to get a doctor.
MICHAL	m	You can't, it's too dangerous.
DOROTA	f	I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust  him.
MICHAL	m	Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's  a pediatrician.
DOROTA	f	He's still a doctor.
MICHAL	m	No, you stay, I'll go.
DOROTA	f	We came to say goodbye. We're going  to stay with my mother in Otwock.The  baby's already there. It's safer.  There's talk that the uprising  will begin any day now.
DOROTA	f	That man Szalas should be shot.  He's been collecting money on your  behalf all over Warsaw. Apparently,  people gave generously. So he  collected a tidy sum. He told us  he was visiting you daily.
DOROTA	f	Oh God!
DOCTOR	m	Acute inflammation of the gall  bladder. Liver the size of a  football. But he'll live. I'll try  to get hold of some levulose, but  it's not easy.
DOROTA	f	Can you visit him again?
DOCTOR	m	Who knows?
SZPILMAN	m	Doctor, thank you.
DOCTOR	m	Don't speak. Rest.
DOROTA	f	Michal brought food. I'll prepare  something now for you, then we  must go.
VOICES	m	Where? Where? Just get out!  Everywhere! Get out into the street!
A MAN'S VOICE	m	Get out now! The Germans have  surrounded the building! They're  going to blow us to pieces.
THE MAN'S VOICE	m	Everyone out, please! Leave your  flats at once, please!
GERMAN VOICE	m	Fourth floor, Fischke!
GERMAN VOICE	m	At the double, Fischke!
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Who the hell are you?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Who are you?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	What the hell are you doing?
SZPILMAN	m	I was... I was trying to open this  tin.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Where do you live?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	What's your work?
SZPILMAN	m	I am... I was a pianist.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	A pianist.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Play.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Are you hiding here?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Jew?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Where are you hiding?
SZPILMAN	m	In the attic.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Show me.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Have you anything to eat?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	I'll bring you something.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Open up.
SZPILMAN	m	Please.
SZPILMAN	m	What's all that gunfire?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	The Russians. On the other side of  the river. All you have to do is hang on for  a few more weeks.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Come down.
SZPILMAN	m	What's happening?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	We're getting out.
SZPILMAN	m	Are the Russians here?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Not yet.
SZPILMAN	m	I don't know how to thank you.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's  His will that we should survive.  Well. That's what we have to  believe.
SZPILMAN	m	What about you?
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	I've got another one.  Warmer. What will you do when it's all  over?
SZPILMAN	m	I'll play the piano again. On Polish  radio.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Tell me your name. I'll listen out  for you.
SZPILMAN	m	Szpilman.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Szpilman. Good name for a pianist.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE	m	...German army! Polish soil  liberated!  Official!
THE WOMAN	f	German! German!
SZPILMAN	m	Stop, for God's sake, I beg you,  I'm Polish!
SZPILMAN	m	Don't shoot! I'm Polish!
1ST POLISH OFFICER	m	He's Polish!
2ND POLISH OFFICER	m	Come out with your hands up.
SZPILMAN	m	Don't shoot! I'm Polish! Please,  please! I'm Polish!
1ST POLISH OFFICER	m	Yes, he's Polish!
2ND POLISH OFFICER	m	Why the fucking coat?
SZPILMAN	m	I'm cold.
2ND POLISH OFFICER	m	Take him to headquarters.
1ST MAN	m	Look at them - bastards!
2ND MAN	m	German fuckers!
3RD MAN	m	I prayed for this, never thought  I'd see it.
LEDNICKI	?	Murderers! Assassins!  Look at you  now! You took everything I had!   Me, a musician! You took my violin! You took my  soul!
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	Do you happen to know another  musician, a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!  Polish radio?
LEDNICKI	?	Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN	m	I helped Mr Szpilman when he was  in hiding. Tell him I'm here. Ask  him to help me...
RUSSIAN GUARD	m	Hey! No talking to the prisoners.  Get away from there!
LEDNICKI	?	What's your name?
LEDNICKI	?	What?
LEDNICKI	?	It was here, I'm certain of it.
SZPILMAN	m	It's not here now.
LEDNICKI	?	I shouted abuse at them, I'm not  proud of it, but that's what I  did, and, I'm certain, I stood  where you are now. There was barbed  wire, and this German came up to  me.
SZPILMAN	m	You didn't catch his name.
LEDNICKI	?	No. I'll ask at the factory. They  may know something.
