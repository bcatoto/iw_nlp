I don't want to drag you down with me. Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own. Pouring it out! I'll get my clothes. In the kitchen. Right. No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away. Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous? I'm sorry. Are you alright? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone... You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison? I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore. What are you asking me? I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. No. No. Yes, I considered it. So...the station is empty? Somewhere else? Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody? Are you married? I will if they don't send me back. Now I become custody of police department? Yes, but he was a cop. ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. You're a cop - you'll never believe me. I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled. No, no, don't talk to Immigration! If I tell you, will you arrest me? Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.Thank you. Okay. Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. You promise? Okay, til tonight. I love you. Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me. Promise? No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and... Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here. Yeah. Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight! Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back? No. Tell me what you want to say. Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it. Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you? Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it? You're not so bad yourself. Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh? That was good. You were holding the evidence. Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something. Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me. Stop it. You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something. What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement. Hey, honey. Okay. Alright. Alright. Eddie, are you okay? Alright, cut, cut, cut. Do you have the suspect in custody? Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department? Detective - can you tell us what happened here? Is it drug related? Can we go up to the crime scene? How many victims are up there? Detective, does it look like a murder? Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! Alright. Go ahead. I want to hear everything he said. What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?He thinks this is some kind of game! I think he's already feeling better. I fooled them into thinking I was alone. He's going to be fine, right Daddy? Daddy, don't start with this again. Tennessee? Don't swear. I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you. You get arrested again, I'll kill you. If you don't see it, it's not real... Don't turn around. Stop it. This is just sad. Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy? Oh, I'm not finished. "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple." As I said. Hmm. "Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby. "But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James." Hmm. Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding. Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement? I would never have imagined us in a place like this. That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought... I don't understand. Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county! Whose justice? Yours or God's? When will you stop? Let the law -- You and I, we've started... something, you know? I don't know what'll happen if you do this. I am so sorry, Jesse. Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting? Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote? Sparkling rocks? Where will you find such a girl? And what's this right girl like? You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James? Thank God you grew out of that. You did grow out of that, didn't you? A river pirate. You didn't want to farm? So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger? Everybody in the county knows it was you who rescued Cole. We're all so proud of you, Jesse. And not a single farm's been sold to the railroad since. You're everybody's hero. I shouldn't tease a hero. Teasing you is completely unfair. You're sick of my company? You shouldn't be up. Jesse, is that your hand? Jesse, are you awake? But still died. You were little Jesse James when you left.Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him. It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case. I can paint anywhere. You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool. "Make" him? You are a fanatic. Is it over? You're just afraid to eat it. It's gonna get cold. Here we go. Oh, right. Hold on. Milo? I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now. Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss. Look at me! I'm gonna change. Just shut up? Are you gonna tell me where you went? Milo, you -- Milo -- He has thousands of employees, Milo -- What? Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me. That was -- different. Poor baby. You know that's not true. Guilt? I remember. ...Why? Nothing? It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there? ...Whaddo I do? Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed? You can't just walk in, either. Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards -- Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and -- Milo. Why would he -- "Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about. You're scaring me. I think we should just go. They hack into people's programs? I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that. Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case. It was a hate crime. Teddy was killed last night. I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much -- What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it. If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor. He's your boss. He's not your -- What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it? That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me. Milo! What about --? We're not gonna let it. Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him? Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die? No way. You have this -- destiny. Didn't you visit the campus? I think that's great, Milo. I do. But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high? Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad. It's important. Then you've gotta ask him about that. C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times. I don't think he knows how. He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clichï¿½ about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes. Prick. Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something. He'll tell me when he gets home. No.Latitude 47 degrees. What? Maybe it's the satellite. But you said the other -- It's three years old, it -- Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?! Please don't go. Why?! Does he know you know? You'll come up with something. You could always say you have to go the bathroom. Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described. Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it? Yeah, that's old, in a tree. He doesn't know about the Day Care. Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts. The dishes are juiced up, too. Gary. What'd he say? 'Cause their apartments might be bugged? Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out. I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally? And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished. You mean -- break in? Before they kill somebody else, too. It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work. But they'd still get the idea, right? A what? He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it. How close are you? Time? But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like -- What about "60 Minutes." We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home. The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine. There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein. Who can we trust? What about the FBI? I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean. ...Milo? He's out of prison? Is that my -- scenario? Tell me. Oh yeah? But why would they --? The Day Care? Why would you do a thing like -- That's great. I -- didn't know. Then and now. But not right now. Long story. Not that interesting. Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people. Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway. Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower. They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going? Did you wanna be alone? Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to -- Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you. No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work. ...Something like that. Yeah. We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers. I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets. You're famous around here. You know my name.No I haven't. Leave him! What are you doing here? Name it. You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks. Say thank you. Do you like it? It is. I did it cooking. It's nothing. I burnt myself. Yes. You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop. It's enough isn't it? Sixty four thousand, eight hundred. My name's Sophia. Hurry. I'll wait for you here. Maybe you will find out. Tell me about it. It's more like a date. I'm not asking you to marry me. It's what you came back for. It's not mine. I'm sorry. You didn't deserve me John Buckingham. I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye. Something else. Goodbye. Please. Why not? Okay. Thank you. I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee? You know you can come under the blanket. What was her name? Except for Small Eyes. Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die? I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy. I'm trying to quit. She's alive!! She is not dead? She's alive? What? I'm sorry. Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John? The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard. What happened between you and the blonde? Not really. Maybe a little. No. No. I don't have nothing. You are pretty naive if you think it is. The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans. Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong. I wasn't saying anything. What? I... I wasn't saying... You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world. You are throwing me out. Excuse me? You don't understand you either. So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no? You didn't mind too much. You... Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for. So now you hate all women? Why? There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John. Sometimes neither. Sometimes. Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina. What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly. And who says what is wrong. And? What are you saying? I don't hate you. We'll pretend it never happened. Okay we won't talk about it. You don't want to talk about it. Why not? No. But you tend to tie them up. He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again. He will come back. But, you know, so what? If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does. Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is. It's none of your business. I don't want to talk about him. I said I don't have any. I don't have any money. Yes. What? You don't have to do this. I can look after myself. I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick. I'm going to be sick. Where's the... Where's the restroom? You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already. So you're just going to be vindictive I know you just want to punish me -- No I don't. Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute. They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank. So what are you going to do? It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why. It's makes it easier. Okay. You don't understand anything. They go. They go. They go. John. They go. "Frenzy". Syevodnya Happy bath day. Today is bath day. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.Yeah. What was his name? What happened? Hi... what's going on here? Is that a cellar door? Who's Frank? Why? Is this about the book? Where are we going? What? I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it. Yeah, they told me to get out of the house. I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up. My mom is gone. Hey. Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time. What's wrong with you? What? How long was I asleep? And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside. Infant Memory Generators. Maybe she's asleep. Oh, yeah. "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this? Who? Are you okay? What? Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us. No... Donnie, wait. I've never... You want to kiss me... And what? Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be. That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted. Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness. What happened to your neck? Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way. Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you? Donnie? And you'd never been there before? So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar? My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead. So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream? I'm going home. Sure. Where are we going? That was a compliment. You're weird. Why is that? Until it withers away. Wonder where we'll be then. You mean soap? I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind. Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero. He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool. He stabbed my mom four times in the chest. Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems. Fuck them. Don't look so freaked. Wanna walk me home? Hey...If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day. Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions. The Lifeline is divided that way. Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline. Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time. Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion. Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go. Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip. Please! Don't say those words. Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you. Rose, we have a crisis. I am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham. Rose. Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts... Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear. I think we've all seen "Bonanza". The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum. I AM THE PTA! And I say that this FILTH is directly related to this vandalism. And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main! The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour. Mr. Cole... not only am I a TEACHER... but I am also a PARENT of a Middlesex child. Therefore, I am the ONLY person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away. She was right about the rabbits. Go. So... will Donnie find his Cellar Door? Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going. A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful. Tell them that everything is going to be just fine. It is up to the children to save themselves these days. Because the parents... they don't have a clue. Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules. I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me. Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people? Is the death of one species less tragic than another? Because the rabbits are us, Donnie. And when the other rabbits hear of Fiver's vision, do they believe him? It could be the death of an entire way of life, the end of an era. Who is Frank? Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?JUST DO IT! What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here! What do you mean "on his way up"!? I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe. I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days. Are you going to yell at me? What? It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it... Nothing. Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help. I guess. What is it now? I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow. Hi. Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed. God, how horrifying. Not the Maxine? YES. Who? How should I know? Who? Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying. Look, I told you I'm not going to college. Will you get off my back for once? Nope. What are you making, pancakes? But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy? Help me what? I didn't check my messages... Huh? What do you mean? I... I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff? ...wow... Hmm. I'm not really sure - working, I guess... Uh-oh. I'm not sure... I mean... I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking? It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something... Well, no - it's more like a "found art object." Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture... I dunno... I just like Don Knotts. It's supposed to be Don Knotts. Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess. Jesus... But I feel weird... it's so sleazy. What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick! Okay, okay... I won't say a word... But I was only trying to be friendly... Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money... You can count on me, sir! Hey Josh. Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it... Because if you do, I'll kill you! I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this. I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird... Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious... Why do you have that stupid poster? It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh! That's just the way I am! You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me. Then why do you hate me so much? "Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me? Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms? Why? I guess. Can I come in? I just stopped in to say hi. Hi Josh. But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat... Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives? Oh my God, that's HIM! I figured something like that... That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out. No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell. SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down. This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners. It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you. So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun! That guy rules! So Josh... I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know -- What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"? Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder. It just came yesterday... Maybe an orange juice. You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps. Hi. I dunno... I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime. There. It's fine. I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off. Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan. Please let me come with you. Please please please... I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you. I need to talk to you. You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy! Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it. Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?! I said "great"... Great... When was this? Why? What did he say? What? When did you see Josh?! I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life. Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood... I don't believe you. What are you talking about? Who? So should I come over? I can't believe it - he actually scored! Do you still want to do something tonight? Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went. What thing? You're insane. I can't imagine spending money on towels. Why do you care about this kind of stuff? I can't afford stuff like this right now. Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try... I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do... No, really... I think one of us should fuck Josh... Yeah, I guess... call me... I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake... Yeah, thanks. Don't worry. Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus. Fuck it. Everything must go! I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime... We were such desperate sluts back then. That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine... Wasn't it like eighth grade? I dunno, but next week is my last class... Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated... ...maybe we should be lesbos... That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers! Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration. Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me! He's like the biggest idiot of all time! Which one? Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together. I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly. Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week. I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time. But those are our people... That rules! At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining... God, how can you stand all these assholes? That guy is totally amazing. Just now... I went with Seymour. Anthony's II! You won't believe it! Guess! Give me all your money, bitch! I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer. Aw c'mon, this is a fun party. If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go? It's a surprise. I know a party we could go to... Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick. Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck. This morning at Seymour's garage sale. Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm. Everybody's too stupid! It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it! It'll only take a second. Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that. JOSH! I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or -- As always. Let's go hassle Josh. I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back. We still have to go in there sometime. Fuck you, bitch! What? How long have you been standing there? Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind. You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you. What are you talking about? What, is she black now? We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking. Forget it, I can't explain it... Yeah, but... you know what I mean. I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool... Oh yeah... It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay? I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour." I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth. Ew, look at this... Come on, it's too late now... Bingo! I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again. This is way too creepy. This kind of thing must happen to him all the time. He doesn't even look that bummed out, really. He's insane! Totally! Look! I dunno... He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable! Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk! It's obviously him! Is he wearing a green cardigan? She says she wants to MMPH! I'm going to tell him you said that. It's still twenty-five minutes early. Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT! God, I think Josh is too mature for us. Shh, it's his answering machine... We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP. I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!" Why do I always have to do it? Oh yeah. Which loser? That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties? I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick. No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine. There! Look at her! There's my dad with Joanie. Look, that's back when I hated you. Look at how cute I am! I've been looking all over for this. Hey - why do you have this? I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff. There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace. Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape. Does Oomie really like this show? Oh, we totally have to. I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail. Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?" Okay, well here's yours... "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer." God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit? Here we go... "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!" What does that even mean? Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"? You loser! Hi, Al! I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp! "Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's? Hey, look at this... Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and -- Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us. You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff... In fact, never. We should follow them! I know, it hasn't really hit me yet. Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest. Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes. Just look at them! Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists. God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing. God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again. He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her. Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh? Since when is she an "actress"? What? Why? Shut up! Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again. This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again... Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again. These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class! What?... Oh suck my fucking dick! I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her. God, what a bunch of retards... See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd? Just because. We're not. What about me? Am I not even here? Well, we won't keep you. What are you doing here, Melorra? Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen... Nothing. Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing. Oh yeah, like he even noticed. Shhh! I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards. Where did you get those pants? It's kind of falling apart. I thought it wasn't for sale. Who does? Do you have any other old records besides these? That's okay... How much is this? A what? Go die, asshole! That tape sucked, by the way! That's not even -- I know it's over, asshole, I -- Tell me what? I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street. ...are you waiting for a bus? Hi... what's your name? Later, "Dude". Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke. Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick! I did too! Did you bring that tape? You're late, asshole. Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you. I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity. Five hundred. That's five hundred dollars. I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone! Shhh... I really need to get some sleep. I was just thinking out loud... I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up... Yeah, well... me neither... No... forget it... What?... Maybe... no... I dunno... God, Dana's going to kill you! What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life! What do you want? I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want? Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us? I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory! You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody! It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again. I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that? You know what my number one fantasy used to be? Oh yeah... and Dana... You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you. ...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job. I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right? Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that. How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out? At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags! What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life. That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist! Jesus, how can you stand her? Where did you get this? You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room. FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana. What about this? Do you have anything to drink? Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone. Can you at least let me in? I had to see you. Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more. I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour. In whatever way you think I mean. So, do you like me, Seymour? Does that mean you don't like me? You must have done something to make her think you like me. What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"? What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me? So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again? And you like them? Well when can we do something? Well forget the art show... let's do something else. Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late. I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you... Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time... I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally... Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing? What, are you trying to get rid of me? Sounds good... So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff? Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana? No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore? Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you... Boo! What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date? What? You're kidding me... So, what happened? Hi, it's me... Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real! Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back! That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something? Wow! What was that all about? Aren't you going to get that? I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them? Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time? Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out. Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation... I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away. Never... I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks! Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships... What, like a girdle? What is that? Are you okay? No, Doofus... blow it out! You can open your eyes now. Don't you trust me, Seymour? I promise I'll take good care of it. Hey, can I borrow this? So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this? Yeah, but still... Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day. What are you, a fry cook or something? You work at Cook's Chicken? "Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"! What, are you a klansman or something? What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this? I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date... Wow, this is so cool... It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet. I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar... At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else... Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless... It's not hopeless... We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all. I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label. Just wait here. Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it? Jesus, Seymour. This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from. So, why did you bring this along? Relax, Seymour, relax... C'mon, Seymour, please? Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal? OH MY GOD! Wow! Look at all these creeps! Fine, I'll go by myself then... PLEASE? We have to! We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot! Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please? Oh my god! We have to go in here! Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture. Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one... Wait, we have to go in here for a second... Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance. We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests. Every guy has a type! C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl? Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits? But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her? What about her? Would you go out with her? Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy! I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service! I'm totally serious! No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds... I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute! No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour. Oh, come on! What are you talking about? God, look at this poster! I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this! Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records! Really? Can I see it? You're right about that. So this is your record collection? What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks? Hey, I was only kidding! Oops! I dropped it! Yeah, sure, I guess... Wow! Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that? Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like -- Okay. How much is it? Wow! Is this one any good? Sure, I guess. Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records... You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music. Do you have any old Indian records?God, fuck you! Well why do I care about that? You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars! What?Wow... finally. Do you want anything? Actually, he's a really nice guy. Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry! Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else! What time? That's all you're bringing? So where's all your stuff? So, whaddya think? But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job. I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea. I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week. Hello? FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life! You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended! There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?! Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it! What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it? Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? That must be it... I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes. Nothing. He came into work. Josh says this is a really good neighborhood... It's a totally normal, average neighborhood! Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow. Just some people from work... Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends... How repulsive! What happened to Seymour? Hello? God, I'm so sick of Seymour. That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy. Do you still want to go to that thing tonight? You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job. Don't you want nice stuff? I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move. Aren't these the greatest towels? Look, we have to get these... No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is. I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that... God, you're really obsessed... Go ahead... Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow? Do you want to do something tonight? If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff. Now are you going to get a regular job? What was that all about? I thought everything must go! Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase... This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff. What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?! I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him. Seventh... you wanted to move out right then! Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment... Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment? When are you finally going to get your diploma? Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job... Get away from me! Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation? Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth! You're just jealous. He gives me a total boner! You're gross. See that guy? You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you. ...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment. God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me. Like what? Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job? No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos. He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy! I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody. He does that every single day. You cunt! No way... when? Where? Where did you get that? Wait... I totally, totally hate you. I don't believe you. What? Where?! We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job. How about this? God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet? Ew ... when did you get that? How about this one? I didn't get it either. What was that all about? Why are we going here? I hate this place. Should we leave a note? I'll bet he never jerks off... JOSH! Why don't you ask him. Waiting for the bus that never comes... There he is... "Hassle"? Where are we going? It's always closed... Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade? Just promise you'll do it. That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun. I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies... "Funky"? Somewhere downtown. Not really... That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen... He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one ...Oh wait... you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats... What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"? He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive... That was truly pathetic. Ew, it's like some gross rat... Gross! What should we do? What if he recognizes us? The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation! He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance. I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off? We should follow him home. Are you sure? Do you think he knows? What's he doing now? What's going on now? What's he doing? I can't believe it! What exactly is a cardigan anyway? SHUT UP! I want to "make love" to him. Look, maybe that's him! I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man. What does it stand for? You're better at it. You call. You know, the green cardigan guy. Hey! We forgot to call the loser! Fuck you! What are you talking about -- who? I want to do him! I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch? I remember every minute of that party. What a little hosebag. You lent it to me in like tenth grade. What is this? So what should we do? Isn't it weird? It's her favorite. We should call him and pretend to be the redhead. God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him. Gross. You can have that one. Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us. I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders." I might actually get the pasta special. Can we call you "Weird Al"? Who can forget this great hit from the 50's? God, it's so totally pathetic. Okay, okay! Or maybe not. That lets us off the hook. What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway? Much later. Hey, look, the satanists are leaving! God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want. It's such a weird feeling. Did you sign up yet? So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment? Why? Hi. Good. How perfect. I know, she needs to die immediately. Forget it... Uh oh... don't turn around... Unless they're in your Summer school class! This is so bad, it's almost good. You loser. Why? What? It's totally sickening. Let's see if they gave me the right diploma... I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up. Call me sometime. Did you remember to pay the phone bill? I wish I could see him. So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us? Please Josh? Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological... On that pathetic fake blind date. Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you. Yeah, she thinks you're a dork. That slut! Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy. What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh? Why? What did she tell you? Josh!? Why would she be with Josh? I don't know... where is she, then? Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you. What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago! She's not at home?I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you. I had to give it to someone else... But I'm sure next year I can -- Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall! Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you. Didn't Principal Jaffee call you? The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely -- Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened. Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you. Well, yes... So what do you think? As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer... Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art & Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name. Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year? Enid, can I talk to you for a minute? And how does an image like this help us to see that? And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism? Did you actually do this painting? These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this. I see... interesting... And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject? Who is this, Enid? And what can you tell us about this... I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret! This shocking image of repressed femininity! Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent? I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this? What do we have here, Margaret? Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier. Talk to us about it... I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. Who is responsible for this?You're fucked up, Lila. Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake. Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested. Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help. It's not so bad. So, it just keeps growing? I don't know why you didn't tell me about this. Lila, what are you doing in there? I need to get ready for my date.French? Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you. You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie. You remind me so much of Nathan. Say my name. Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. Hello, my little boy. Okay. Please let me go with you. Okay, my sweet. Good night. That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? Where do we look for little lost Puff? We still have you and I. Oui. Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong. A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri. That's Lila? So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men. Don't be silly! And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir." You were wonderful! You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig? Hunh. That's not how he tells it. I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry. I've moved on. Anyway. Come already to the point. Please. I look a mess. Well? You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here! You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need! What for? Like what? Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you! We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what! Call you back. You bastard! What do you want? Yeah? What? Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love! The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too. You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you. But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan. No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you. You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this. Stop. Get away. Not in front of the boy. Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I. Hmmmph. Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself. I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do? Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila. What is wrong, my darling? Shh. You are sweet. Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment. Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower. I am sleepy. Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad. It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no? Shall we close up, then? Oui. I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl. Coincidence, yes? And how is our son? I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed. Is everything fine? Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry. Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left. I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid? You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you? I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no? Thank you so much for accompanying me. I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now? Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and... Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this. Oui. Perfect! Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much, monsieur. Oui. Oui, doctor, oui.Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles? How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly? Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows. It's embarrassing, okay? Nothing! I'll be out in a minute! Okay. If you think it will help. That's what I'm counting on. No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life. No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. He's dead. You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you. Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason. Good. I'll show you how, apey. You what? We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it. Very well. It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay, Puff. I'll be in touch. I'm really glad you two found each other. Shut up, you. Oh, Rosie. Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will. Ready! Oh, Rosie. Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair? Your brother should have his license revoked. How'd you know where I was? Rose, please go away. Go the fuck away, Rosie. No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob? And I think I'm going to. Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him. Three foot one. I have a friend you might like to meet. I didn't know you were into that sort of thing. Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill? One night stand? He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with. I cannot believe how in love I am with this man. Really? I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work. God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff. Won't he be able to tell? Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he? What do you mean? Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose. Shut up and tell me. Tell me. I could use someone up my alley. Always. Ow. I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl. Ouch. Yeah? Ooka. Oook. Oook. Ugnh. Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best. Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. How the hell would you know anything about the human heart? I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair! Do you know what I gave up to be with you? And what did you do tonight, honey? And what did you do tonight, honey? That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey? So he's doing okay? You were gone a long time. Ummm. It's good. Should I come with? Absolutely! You just have to control it. We're not apes. Oh boy! That was wonderful! I had sold my fucking soul. Such as my man and how to please him! Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal! Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because... Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway. Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are! Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around. Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else? No. I don't want your work to be cruddy. How's work? I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila! You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong? Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in... Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl! Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. Really? I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want. Do you like my new look? Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different. It would just be helpful to know. Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know. Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot. Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk. So, how's it going today? I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men. You are an animal. I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God! I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this. Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch! I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to... It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry. Who from work? Who is it? Who is it? Nothing. Be right out. All right. You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan. Nathan, what the hell are you talking about? Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal. What? I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your... He looks perfectly fine. I think he's feral. Come on. No. Too... upright. Might've been a person. I don't know. Something. Did you see that? That's very funny. Absolutely. Yes. Yes, darling. Fifteen. Of course. Yes, darling. I don't think so. Why? It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds! Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! Do you? Oh do you, darling? Do you? You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes. I'll be out in a minute. Nathan! Yeah But I have some peculiarities also. I like you, too, Nathan. You really enjoy my company? You do? No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas. Boy, this is good! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things. I'm sorry? Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish... It looks wonderful. We are animals after all. I'm not sure. Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan? What's the larger experiment? Paper or cloth? How's it going? I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. You are a therapist, right? I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Where? You've got to respect that. They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug." Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.Tell him, Harold. Tell him, Harold. And? Harold! Tell the boy again. That is the wrong fork, young man. Harold, tell the boy. And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something. Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. Yes... Derek. I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man. Wait!I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you. You must shut down the engines. Now this is getting exciting. Now that's just gross. The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve. Blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. And look at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood! Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble. No... That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang. You need to get laid! I'm afraid I cannot assist. Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six... Kay-em 14. I love you. I am now. I missed you, Thorgan. Oh, goody. I'm so pleased. I'd clap if I could. A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him. Don't worry about me. I live for this shit. Oh, alright. Do I have to? Who are you apologizing to? Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten. Ow! It's just you and me, then. Sory... I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn. I didn't say I was good at it. Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . . The air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.His dead body with a bullet in it. Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him. No. I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police. She's younger than I am. Did she tell you that? How would you feel if your father married someone younger than you? Because they got wet. Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math. Yes. Yes. I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home. Yes. I was washing my hair. I guess. No. I was in the shower. No, she'd stashed it by then. I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood. Not that I saw. But like I said, I went straight upstairs to take a shower.I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything. I don't need backups. Harvard is the school I'm going to. I have a 4.0. That's right. Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it. I believe you! Don't worry. No! I know! You helped me go from a six to a four! How? Whatever it is -- it could save you. Who could better understand than me? He means well. He's really brilliant and all. Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange. Sort of. I'm a Delta Gamma and I'm a huge fan of yours! You, however, had time to hide the gun, didn't you, Chutney? After you shot your father? And if you in fact, heard the gunshot, then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs. Which would mean that you would've had to have found Mrs. Windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible. Isn't that right? That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate? Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down? You know, a girl in my sorority, Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we all told her not to. Curls really weren't the right look for her -- She didn't have your bone structure. How many, would you say? Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham? Where you got in the shower. Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day? But you didn't hear the shot, because you were in the shower. So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot? Did you hear a shot fired? But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun? And when you came downstairs, what happened? Okay -- Ms. Windham, when you uh arrived back at the house? Was your father there? Tell him, Paulette. Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately. I'm Elle Woods. Ms. Bonafante's attorney. Dewey Newcomb? But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"? Yes, I am. So everything you just said -- You're hitting on me? Not really. I know how competitive it all is -- I'm sorry, but -- Thank you. Is everything okay? Thank you! He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off. I promised her I'd keep it secret. I can't break the bonds of sisterhood! Yes. But I can't tell you what it is. All I know is -- it's not Brooke. See? Forget it. I've already spent too many hours crying over you. For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man? We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again? Why didn't you call me? He chose them already? What's going on? What's the point of staying? All people see when they look at me is blonde hair and big boobs. No one's ever going to take me seriously. The people at law school don't, Warner doesn't -- I don't even think my parents take me seriously. They wanted me to grow up and become a Victoria's Secret model who marries a rock star. Now, for the first time, it seemed like someone expected me to do something better with my life than wear underwear for a living. But I was kidding myself -- Donovan didn't see me as a lawyer. He saw me as a piece of ass just like everyone else. It turns out, I am a joke. Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it? I'm so happy for you! Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual. I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman. Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage? So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had? I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty. Look at him. He's still scratching his head. Yes, you are. Go -- you can do this. You ready? I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass. Definitely! I love him! She could use some mascara and some serious highlights, but she's not completely unfortunate-looking. She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club. That's terrible! No! What'd you do? Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger. You can't even imagine. Delta. Gamma. I'm her sister. Uh -- family. I'm here to see Brooke Windham. You're pawning The Rock?! Yes, he is. Yes, you are. What? Really? You're kidding! I know. He has it sent out. Really? Thanks. It's not my alibi to tell -- Too bad you and I are the only ones. Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life? Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing? You know her? Not yet. I can't believe you guys are actually here -- but this case is important. I'll make it up to you after finals, okay? I -- promise. I really want to do a good job. Margot! I will... No way -- What?! Power yoga? Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano -- Your scrunchie? I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma! Once Warner sees me as a serious law student, he'll want me back. It's a completely brilliant plan! So? Thank you. I love you, too. I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more -- Serious! What if -- you know -- it's not the night? Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming... Too demure? You think? You guys are so sweet! Is he the only one? Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow. Are you asking me on a date? Oh, my God! Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not. Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake. I'm quitting. Gay men know designers. Straight men don't. He's gay! Enrique is gay! For a butt-head? Yes. Fine. Sorry I brought it up. Well, you should -- If you look good, you feel good and if you feel good, you project joy into the world. The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself. Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take? If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it. That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination! It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model. Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow." I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund. Did you see the icky black color of her hair? You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing. She's not! Mrs. Windham Vandermark? No, she can't move for an hour. Maybe not to your face... Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised. You're kind of being a butt-head right now. But maybe it's not what you think. A) He's an old man with a really big penis. B) She never told me I was fat. And C) Victoria Principal sells on that network. Why? Aside from that. Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke. My money's on the angry daughter or the ex-wife. Don't ask. Thanks again for your help! Wow. I'm glad I met you. Donovan, Royalton and Levinson. Neat. Did she do that to you, too? And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out? Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time? I can't believe you're a Laker Girl! You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial. What're you doing here?! Really -- What? I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks! Almost. Calvin Klein's spring line is atrocious. Don't you agree? Girls -- I'm going to Harvard! I don't know! I don't know anything any more! I just need to be by myself. I just don't understand what went wrong -- Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good. No -- it's just -- not me. But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight -- Of course, I do! Maybe she found him like that. She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted! She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing! And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it? See you tomorrow! I do. I don't know -- I did? I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one. I'd rather have a client who's innocent. Neither. I guess it'll have to... You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips. Wait -- my social events schedule is missing. Has Warner Huntington checked in yet? Huh. Imagine that. Looks like I am. In court. On opposing sides. Really? Thanks for the backup. See? I gave her my word, Warner. Thank you. But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes -- Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner? Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year. I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here. Thank you. Having fun? I'm sorry, I just hallucinated. Do anything exciting? Fine. Except for this horrible girl who made me look bad in front of my Civ Pro professor. But no biggie. You're here now. How was your summer? Oops! Time for class. Meet me after? On the benches? What, like it's that hard? Harvard. Law school. No, silly. I go here. I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough? Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt -- So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me? Everybody likes me! How can it be the right thing if we're not together? No. Then what? My boobs are too big? You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde? You're breaking up with me?! I thought you were proposing. I completely agree. And I fully support that. Of course. I'm fully amenable to that discussion. So are you!Hello! You're like, a lawyer. Speaking of which, can you please put on some party clothes? You look like someone rolled you in something sticky and dragged you through a K- Mart. Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl. Keep June first open -- you're one of my bridesmaids. And give Warner our love. Josh proposed! Picking out my wedding dress! It's Elle! Guess what I'm doing right this second? Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday? My lucky scrunchie. It helped me pass Spanish. Here. You're gonna need this. But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school? Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week. We still love you. Sisters forever! Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar! Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you. I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence. Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond. Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis? Pull up next to him! Yeah, luckily. Why?! Let's all go! Road trip! Cunnilingus? You're right. Phew! Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough? It's not a Theta -- Elle?I didn't stick around long enough to watch him stick his swizzle stick in her mouth, but I'd bet my next check that that's where he was about to put it. Haven't you seen the cabana boy? But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke. Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house. I never met the woman, but from what my daughter tells me, she's quite the cun -- So, I hear the tart from California shot Heyworth. I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.You can't go home! Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer. How'd it go at the trial? And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun! Good one. What's the point? Look at me. No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine". That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God... Which must be a nice vacation for his balls... God, that felt great! No. You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah. Could I be anymore goddamn spastic? So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"? Is she? Is she as pretty as you? So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits? What could I do? He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me. I didn't even get to go to his birthday party. Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap. You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out." After you went to all that trouble? Spill.Who are all these people? I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh. And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying. I'm going to bed. Uh...using Josh like that. I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not. What are you doing up so early? You'd better call and cancel. And why was the alarm on? What's wrong? Mom? I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam. It's not what I was expecting. My mother would die. Did you feel anything? I want you to try something with me, okay? I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson. He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it. He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me. I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided. What's that? Monday. Nope. Is that legal? Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage? Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working. No. He seems lonely. Sorry I got you into trouble. What? Where are you?! He asked where you were! He wants you with him. Not if what he left me was real. If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant. What? Are you afraid of heights? Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay? No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just friends. I thought I was helping you. Not really. I was wondering. Josh said... Are you sure you're totally into guys? Does everything have to have a point? It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way. Why are you so uptight? We're not gonna do anything. I'm coming in. I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me. This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride. He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars. His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer. I'm okay. Huh? Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie? Turn over. I wanted him to marry her. Your dad dated my mom after her divorce. Do you remember me from when you lived here? I'll get your back. Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom. You look better without make-up. Tell him I said "hi". Where's your dad? You should stay. Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you. Your dad's really gonna build his house? Where to? What are you doing here? Hi. No. He won't leave my room. If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry. I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him. Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day. He's got a standing invitation. He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered. Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop. I wouldn't want you as a friend. I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone? Are you guys' friends? It could have been a squirt gun. IPO's caused the rat population on this street. This is such a street of whiners.It's so beautiful. He's here. Check the bathroom. I guess it depends on what you give up on. Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"? Since seventh grade. I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years. Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work. You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming. I thought I might stop by. Will he talk to me? He's not the type to worry. Well, he doesn't need to worry. He's at work while I'm here. Why is that? You're so nice to let Sam use your shower. I better get the kids home. Don't move! Are you going to kiss me? I could die. Back. Neck. Back. 'I'll be in the bedroom.' No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?' Peter left me yesterday. I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me. Is your back still killing you? I need to know. If I weren't married? I'm married. It sounded like a pick-up line. You've never said that before. That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that? When I picked you up from the train station...what you said. Nothing is going on with us, is it? I thought we were helping. Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it. What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time! I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George. No. Why? I like to be with Sam. Let's see if you've gotten any better. I smiled at him. This was my very first slow dance. Do you need help? Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers. I kind of said that maybe they could do something. Help. I'm sorry. They really wanted to come. I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. I don't think they'll be too much trouble. Where's Sam? Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home. I thought you'd be up with the sun. You're not well. I've been wrong a lot in my life. The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George. My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him. That wasn't a dream. That was Sam. It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real. I dreamed about your house last night. I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow. We have it on video! Was that when? My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that. Do you remember? What have you been before today? Sam's favorite. The first and the last. I was here six years. And I only hated two. I used to live here. It makes me sad. Well, for later then. George -- I did say he could go. No. I was going to let you do that. Last time you were gone for a week! I drove over and you were gone. What was I supposed to do? When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working. I'm married. No, you don't. Trust me. Forget it, really. I'll survive. One of you would end up dead. Thank you for at least sounding sincere. You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer? He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore. Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day. Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it. Where will you live? How many years did I live with your beams and boards? First in the garage, then in the living room. We're going to do it, Robin. Next year. Next year. Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire... Money? You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it. Why call me? Why would they tow your truck? But you can't call me while you think? What did you do with your dog? Where have you been for a week?! You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?! What? You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion! I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead! Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore! He never answers. What are you doing? Where he always is. Lock the door behind you. Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend? Ring the bell before you try the door. I feel in love with George again. I hardly recognize you with a beard. Sam took them to a movie. That's the problem. Despite you. You never really trusted me. What are you doing home? I know. Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that. We haven't been away together for three years. What difference does a few months make? I can't go right now. I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is. I'm helping George build his house. After the kids are back in school. I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall. The biggest waste of time since television. To shave your chest? What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you? It would worry me. Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you? I'll make you something. We've eaten. A man he respects. I don't have a clue anymore. I wish you'd talk to him. He needs a man. I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day. You could keep it and rent it out? You're sure about this? I don't know what I'm doing. Can you stay for dinner? I didn't go in your room. In the bedroom. Go tell your father we're eating. Nothing R, okay? Would you stop being ridiculous? Your father wants Sam home as much as I do. Adam, that's not true! I brought a few of my own. Ryan, would you rather swim or work? Not all day. I'll be home after lunch. I just thought it would be nice. What did you say? He'll be gone for his birthday. Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.I want you to take her with you. Take her. Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am. Goodbye, Bobby. I never promised you anything. Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again. Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is. With what? Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through. Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay. Shhh. He'll hear you. Ho's a good guy -- Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl. Yeah? You sure? Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months. Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me. You shouldn't. He likes you. Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself. The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too. I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him. Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on. She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready. Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late. Oh, please. They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor. Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money. Oh my god. What happened? The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered. Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride? Where were you?"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet." I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing. The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be. Five CC's. What's the maximum safe dose? Left-handed, he was funny . He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped. I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out. Switch hands. He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell. Yeah...before your time. Stu. That was right about the time we met. I don't know. I guess it was... Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food... Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to - What'll it do if they pull the plug? I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake . No. I want to give him more . I want to give him a massive dose. He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is? He called me "Doc." But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring... It looks so... new . You're wearing a topcoat , Stu. - Where are your pants? Baby, don't lie. I know you went out. Stu? Is that you? Where did you go ? What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising! I had to park two blocks away. Is something - They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times. I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay? Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone - You sure this is...medically advisable? What are you watching? You're acting kind of...odd. Stu, are you...feeling okay? Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back. Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back. What's the matter? Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming. It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER. Stu? I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky. I don't think so. <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy! What's the "bad" part? Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck . You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it! Who? Can't you give it to me later? It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there... You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you! Kimmy! What's the matter? It's too soon even to - talk about that! Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a - The ring... I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine. When'd you get in?Alex, what are you doing? I think he wants me. I found a picture of his wife. Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man. No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's... That's always tough. How long were you together? Are you okay? It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him! Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something! Hey, I have an idea... It's coming! Oh my God! We're dead! Help! Brenda, are you okay? Come sit. Psychology. Thanks. Really? That's amazing. Actually, I just met her. This is Alex. We already know each other. Hey, Brenda. Hot dogs. What should we get? Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic. Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me! That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay. Then what are we going to do? Oh. Look, what I'm trying to say -- Listen to me I -- I know, but I've been thinking -- Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend. There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this. No, Buddy, I'm the one he wants. Well... okay... but only as a friend. Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of -- Feel that? Can you feel that? He's here. What about you, Buddy? Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon. We should act out our inner most fantasies. Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it. That we should take our friendship a little further? Come on. There's a first aid kit in the lab. Hugh Kane. Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand. It looks like the furnace. Alright! Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me? Shhh! Buddy... Okay. Yeah, it will be fine. I wanna check something out. Will you come with me? Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know. That's just it, Buddy. I'm a girl. You can't be so rough with me. You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing... Hi Buddy. Okay. See you later, friend. But, hey, maybe we can be friends. I'm sorry, Buddy. You seem really nice, but I'm just getting over a really bad relationship, and I'm not ready to start dating yet. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff. No. I never date outside my race. Thanks. I'm Cindy. But he'll kill her! She killed herself a week before he died. Okay, I get the point. Thanks, I'll be fine. What, you think I did this to myself? I think so. Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay? Where's Shorty? Right behind you. The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt. Come in somebody. Can you hear me? How about these buns? I am. So just do me a favor and stay away from me. Oh, right. Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I... Noooo!!! This can't be happening? Both of them? It was you... Stop! -- Not in a thousand years. Stop touching his brain! Hanson, please. Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him! Ummm!! They smell delicious. I'm Cindy. Oh my God! I'm here with the... Alright, let's take a vote... I'll go. What are we gonna do? He won't let us go. He's going to kill us. Just wait, you'll see. Would you like me to help you pass them back? Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened? No, my friends are right here! Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and.... Yes, we made it! Father! Shorty! You're alive!! But... what about your head? Are you? She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk. You better go get Dwight and the Professor. Did you do that? That was a great idea, Shorty. Yeah, I didn't know what else to do. Am I cool now? Uhn! Uhn! Uhn! Yo! That jacket is tight. Left, right, left, right, crossover kick... Oh. Huh? Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not. You could use the grade, huh? So, do you think you made it into the class? Don't touch me!! Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them. I think she's starting to suspect something? Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax. I wouldn't go that far. Got a problem with that? There's something going on in this house. I'm not crazy. What are you getting at, Professor? I'm telling you, it was possessed. I got it! Got my camera right here. Yippie! Wasn't that amazing? Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here. Professor, what's the history of this house? Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her. It's okay. I understand. I'm so glad you're here. Father, come in, please.And I love you, Pete! Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again... Tell them Pete. Tell them... Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning. Did you bring along something to read? And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger? You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that. You've got everything? Whatever happens. I am, too. Forget about all that. You want to do the right thing? Then defend your name. If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. I know the law, and the law's on your side. But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist? I believe you. You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name. Oh, yes. Yes, he was. I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you. Hi. Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working. Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down. You mean, me? ... including me. Right? Dad... Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head? I think it's worse now. No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? "Your honor, I object!" Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed. Dad? No... I can't... I have to... I can't... I see... What... do you remember? It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step. Your dancing's very good. Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one. Oh. Okay. Now, did you remember that, or... Exactly. And he got good. You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet... Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer. No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends. You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful. When did you start smoking? Well, there's got to be a way... What about a loan? You could go to the bank...? Nine hundred... You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening... We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday. This is strange. Do you feel it? ... and It's just... well, deja vu. No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before... Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas... I'm fine. Really. Nothing. Yes. Hic! Yeah... No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I? Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now. Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that. You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl. Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact. And why not? After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here. Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them. Through the door. It comes apart. Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here. Be a gentleman. You have to help me down. You first. You must not remember anything. Come on. Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere. Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight. You look... different. No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time. Do you... remember me?You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart! Luke! Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone! Some of it might come back to you. Sit. Play with me. Oh dear, yes. You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense. You loved Chopin. You used to call it "heaven music." "Teach me some heaven music," you used to say. I taught you that. Nineteen-oh-nine. I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.Honey? I...wait, what are you talking about? You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about. You won't care who's in your damn movie. Things always look much worse in the morning. How nice for everybody. Come swimming. The water's glorious. You'll fix it. You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas. It's always not this time. If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone. You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do. Mac? Oh there you are. What are you doing, honey? No more work. Don't you feel breezy. So they tell me. Not soon enough, of course. How are you, Sal? You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know. A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it. Doesn't it, Mac? You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. It's alright, isn't it? My God, your wardrobe is incredible. It took me forever to decide. Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you. You saved my life. Just don't fucking tell her. You know Sophia. She's so damned judgemental. And she's so damned... perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just fucking don't tell her. Because you know Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him comparing. I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding. And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy. I've got a ghastly headache, actually. I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby. I'll change back before we leave. It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours. You know it could be disaster. He's so allergic. It's terrifying. They can tell from the eyelashes, you know? He's got eyelashes yay long. They must be a foot long. The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up. Didn't I say? To dander. Otis. He's allergic. What? I'm not. What a fucking day! We only just got a sitter. I don't know her from fucking Adam. She could be a serial killer. I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number. Oh my God, the sitter. I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph. Pictures. They're always in my tote. I left my tote in the damn trailer. But! He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth. Dander. He's allergic. Otis. So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him. With a sitter. We have a sensational sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with her. You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family. Amazing with kids. Really? Really. Don't you miss it? You think so!? I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working. And that takes it's toll, you know.Take good care of it. It's not a contest. Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy. I told his father he'd be on that flight. Is he not going? I booked a flight. He's gonna miss his flight. I love her too, Joe. Happy anniversary. You're a good match, you two. Can you help me with this stuff? I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go. You need to call your dad. She left a note. She's in ICU. Lucy overdosed. Harry called. Let's go upstairs, okay? I love you, Joe Therrian. Escape hatch. Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry. I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay. It's hard to tell with her. Oh, very jealous. Just did. Jealous? It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. Directing suits you. Sally? What a nose. You missed your calling. No, not anymore. Happy anniversary, scout. I never put myself in harm's way. I'm the hired help.Not as a rule. Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper? Hm. We should do it again. A perfect night. Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus. Oh yeah? Oh yeah... Are you my big hard hero? Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero? There's a test, you know. Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi? Nice to meet you. I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry. Ours. The infamous dog? And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see? But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid. You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you. Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that -- Don't be silly. I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long... Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good. But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know? I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all. Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going. Don't you find? It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize. I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you read the new Styron? Still. Well. Let's drop it. But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally. Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it's Sally. The character that's based on Sally. The character that's based on Sally in the book. Nothing that can't be exchanged. Lovely. We have a gift?You have? Excuse me? We live next door. Monica. I'm so sorry. I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know. I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair. But the moment was exactly the same. The same, you know, dynamic. And almost verbatim, wasn't it? I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that passage in your book. The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre. That's very nice. Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold. Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about. He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better. Yes. Medallions. Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment. It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank. Ryan's really angry with me. Lemon. Okay. What am I, five? I'm a little in the puke zone. I've never done this before. I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny. I will treasure this. Would you sign it for me. I'm sure this is inappropriate. I'll be your best friend. Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking. Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually. And Ryan works at home. The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism... I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on the outside, yes. And there's been all this friction. A little out of my element. I'm a little nervous, so... Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober eight years. And it's difficult if I... you know. It's better if I don't. Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe. Sally did all this herself? Your Eames table is incredible. And the B&B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. Something soft. Please, Ryan. Let's just go home, okay? Don't go in, Ryan. All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH. Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. Because, God help you if something happens to that dog? We have to find the dog, Ryan. I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! Ryan, you've got to come! You've got to help me find the dog! I let their dog out. We need to find the dog. I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. Ryan, you're a great man. You need a good review and you'll be fine. The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need... I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan. But I think you're really nice people... They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us... I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila. Do you want to go home, Ryan? I love it here. Don't you love it here, Ryan? I love it here. And I love tonight. And I love these people. And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. Utterly fantastic. He always has two or three going... Ryan. I... I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Well, whoever did this is amazing. Yes. Yes, great! It's a beautiful house. Ryan! We could hardly say no. Sally?One guess. You're fucking desperate. You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor. Would it make a difference? Why didn't you come in? A triumph. When did you get here? Thank you, thank you, thank you. It's not going to come up. You need to knock off the pills, Clair. Why would she care? You want a Tylenol, or something? I'd say it was down. Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair? Borrow whatever you like. Oh. Well, probably. Oh. Oh. Why didn't you bring him? Why didn't you bring him? This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair. Of course. Count on it. Damn straight. And you're not the wife. Well you could tell him otherwise. It was good of you to be all this help. But he doesn't want to go tonight. He's not going tonight. Yeah. Would you leave us alone right now? Thanks for coming. Ryan's novel. Take your time, Jer. How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do? You're out of your mind. Scout's honor. Yes. Whatever you say. The Roses? And of course they said yes. We'll be fine. He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that. You know how he hates it here. He's directing now. We couldn't be on more solid ground. Well, you're a tower of support. We've only been over this how many times? I know. I know that. Don't spoil it. I adore him. I love you, you're a genius. Fantastic. Out here. Sure. I know. They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby. Ah... He's my favorite. It's a Calder. Me too. Me too. I guess. Okay. You don't have to. I'll be with you. Everybody hates the messenger. I know. Yes. Don't make allowances. I'll never be ready. Some people just shouldn't have children. I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe. I did want it for us. But I couldn't do it. I don't really think I can do it. I'm a monster. Exactly. You think this was to hurt you?! My God, Joe. It isn't about you. I wanted you back. I told you when we met I never wanted children. I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it. You weren't listening. I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me. I had an abortion two weeks ago. Don't. Anyone else? Cal, too? Mac? Mac says it? Cal? Who? Who? Who thinks that? Not really. I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. That's what all our friends think, anyway. It's a shit novel anyway. I don't look my age, Joe. What are you saying? About me! And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part? Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me? I'm an actress! It's about our marriage for fuck's sake. Everybody knows that... Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her? It is true. You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone. You want to talk about bullshit? Lucy called you three times this week. She's a fucking mess, Joe. Your sister is a fucking mess. She needs you. I talk to her more than you do. You've been through it. That's how you love people. When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you. And how hard it hit? It's not like this all the time. You walked out on a five year marriage. I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. Otis! Come! Good boy! Come! What else don't I know about, Joe? Let's get really clear here. Yeah, let's talk about that. You seem to be rather an expert. I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties. Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it. But I guess that's what I interrupted. It was done. When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door. It was done. Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Otis!!!! Fuck you. There are fucking coyotes out there. Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away. She left the fucking gate open. Don't be so sure. Someone left the goddamn gate open. Otis got out. Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open. I'm worried about my spine. I'm very worried about my brain and my spine. It's ecstasy, Sal. Not properly watered. Dinner. Don't be angry. Truce? You've got Cal. You've got Gina. You've got Skye? We're the leftovers. Still champions. It's alright. Be our guests. Well, not yet. The gate was open? Yes. In the kitchen. And Joe's huge in Europe. He's like a rock star in London. His novels sell millions. Of course we do. We have to sign our taxes. Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors. Really? I'm going to throw up. And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two? No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake. You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother. They can't find a sitter... Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on. Just a moment. It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party? Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come... I mean, you're really back. I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we? No. Did you? What? Through the sweats or not? In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us. I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world. Hardly... Happy anniversary, baby. No luck. Not good. Well...wow... I was faking it. I've been feeling caged for sometime. Funny, huh? I didn't say a word. Trust him. Of course it's alright. How long ago was it? You fucking cow, can't you read?! There's a goddamn sign on the gate. I did it. I so wish I'd known. Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator. Hors d'oeuvres or something? Are you working on a new book? Oh? Yes. And you've met Joe. Hi. Monica and Ryan? Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like. Panes? We're going to have to go back out there. Thank you, Panes. That's not an answer, is it? Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster? Thanks. Nothing's wrong. It's great, okay? Having the time of my life. Mac's a fantastic director. And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said. And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah. No. Not something new. I never like to talk about my work. I don't want to talk about it. Yes. Fine. You're a shit. No. Really. For real. Really. So how are you really doing, Panes? About five thousand dollars. With my discount. Shit. It's my Galiano. Shit! Everyday. You know it's true. We're just feeling our way back. It's our anniversary, Panes. Okay. Like the last time. Like the last time. I don't want it to be just one of our parties. Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined. They're not just our business managers, Panes. I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love. Fuck you, Panes. How? She's all over him, are you blind? Oh, Jesus, Panes. I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house. Really? I need a drink. Come hide with me. Panes is here! Will champagne help? Are you lovesick? Good, you brought your violin. I want you to play. Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us? Monica and Ryan. Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis. You're keeping a record, are you? Thank you. This was so unnecessary. I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much. We keep him in at night. Well, so glad you decided to come. Relax. You've done enough. You don't need to do that. What are they? I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center. I'll be right out. But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic. Why are you doing this? Not nice. Not kind. We're fine. We're great. We're having a baby and we're moving to London. Neither does Joe. You weren't exactly horrified. And Cal's this massive adult? Hey, let's sit down. I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin. Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids. No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time. Don't I? I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted. And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready... What do you mean, thank God? Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone. Sophia! I'm not even pregnant! And the food sucks, I know. Oh Soph... She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don't trust anyone. Big time. But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she? She's a genius. We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she? It's much more personal in here. So where should I put it? She's such a great photographer. Isn't this a fabulous picture? Nevermind. In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them. Like Joe. He's a novelist. And here they are! Enough about me.I think there are sixteen there. You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. When I read your work I felt that you knew me. Women must tell you that. And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know? I am Genna. How many women must tell you that. And the script is wonderful. Wonderful and lean and visual... Oh, I love that. I'm just great. I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you. And I'm so happy you asked me to. I'm so touched. I know how private you and Sally are. Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five. Very. Are you asking me to marry you? If he were still alive, maybe. Yeah. Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research. I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony. Do Peter Sellers again. Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky. Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!! Really?? Oh? Thank you. Oh? No, no thanks. Yes. Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers? And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it justice. And I hope we can spend time together. And I'm gushing. It's my worst quality. I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh my God. You're my icon. I've been watching your films since I was a little girl. Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself. I don't mind... Happy anniversary. Thank you for making me a part of it. Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all your movies. When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. They said you were too real. I worship you. And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman. Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.Let's get the kids. Are you the funniest person I know, or what? Oh. Do you have any pictures? You should have brought him. What is that thing? So where is young Jonah? Not for a second. Cal can have all that. Never. I'm glad that's all over for me. You look so well, Clair. A wraith. No you are not. You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash. You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child. "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. Ha! Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally. It's only five months since Joe came back. His sister does. Big time. And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. I don't have a drug problem. Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? Don't try and change the subject. Oh God, it feels great! He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. He wants playmates. Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. Honey, I'm not worried about you. You are going to be a fantastic mom. Not an issue. I pressed you, remember? Joe, on the other hand, is a different story. Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it? Oh honey, let's. Well good. Thank God. You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen. Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit. There's no excuse for pain like that. You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing. I trust you. Well, I don't trust her. I never have. So how much do you hate her? The both of you. A notch above the storage room. I thought it was okay where it was. Hm. Yes. Would you like to meet my husband? I hope they're watercolors! Hmm. Where are my kids? Ah. And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over. Because you're both, so, what - introspective? And you should have done it ages ago. I'm Sophia Gold. Come meet my husband, Cal. Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming? Evie has a little something for you.George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years. Two years. George, I can't wait that long. What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict? Surprise. Relax, baby. We're going to wind up like us. Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute. Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents. Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you? I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds. Yeah, I don't feel so well. Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry. Are you kidding? We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic. You happy, baby? What is? Derek! You'll see for yourself. You happy, baby? What is? Derek! You'll see for yourself. Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy. You can't sell this to your friends. It's garbage. Tuna, this is crap. Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy. You can't sell this to your friends. It's garbage. Tuna, this is crap.I know, Dad. I love you too. Shhhh. I know, Dad. I know... It's alright, Dad. Swear on my life. I don't believe you. You swear? But I've got school. You know I can't. Mom will never let me go. You swear? Where are you going? Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay? California. No. I just kind of like the sound of it. Yeah. You mean, like a trip? Do what you want, it's a free country. What do you want from me? I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone. What? George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay. Well, here I am. See? What are you doing here? Are we gonna split up? What's happening to us?Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima. Que va hacer? Thanks. I am. Where's Martha? Better than you. George, he wasn't asking. Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego." Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego? Kristina's fine. Hey, George. You okay? She's getting big. Getting her own ideas. Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her. Yeah? I better see some money out of it. I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony. Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school. What do you want? Fuck you, George. I knew you'd say something like that. Always thinking about yourself. You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something. That's right. Always spying, always judging. Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy. You let Diego fuck you in the ass. Maybe you are a fucking faggot. You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me. My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy. Fuck you, George, just fucking drive. Don't give me that shit. You just better do something. Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live? What are we going to do?! What are we going to use for money?! Oh fucking relax. Let your hair down for once. It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes. You're such a fucking pussy. I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid. Out. Can you lift the furnace. I need money. I said, I've seen it before. Yeah. I know. She did that before. She did that before. Pablo said no? George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you. Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I? You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire. I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George. Why are you smiling? I don't think so. Hello.I don't. Your father was his best friend. He loved Jeremiah. So he must hate him the most of all now. He'll take his time. But even if it is too late. If your father is dead. It's not over. The door has to be closed. It's the only way. It's possible your father may not be dead yet. I know damn well she's there. Outta my way, boy. Cinnabar? I'm coming! Some holes can't be filled. Some hungers can't be satisfied. Don't feed that dog. But. Where are we, baby? What? Jimmy, you've got -- No? That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now? Kill us? Kill us all? I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here. No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now. Left hand's the past. Your right's the present. And the future. But it's not written in stone. It's written in flesh and blood. And flesh and blood will change. See? There's something here, a new line, right across your life line. My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her. Let me see your hand. Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck. My God. My dress. We have to find it. And burn it. And shut the door. Told you so. Alright. We tried. Let's go home. Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out. We'll have to sneak in. Fine. Maybe I got nothing to lose. 'Cept you. Like what? I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight. But no more than you do. We're not witches. I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it. Maybe we all do. Eddie Mack, that cop. And Jeremiah. And even when he's done, who knows. He won't be satisfied. Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more. Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied. He'll kill them. He'll kill every last one of them. Sure, if it was really him. But it isn't that simple. Jimmy's body died a long time ago. And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose. You got his hands. Beautiful hands. I didn't even know. That night. When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me. Life's like that. Grows right out of death. Your father. He was your father. If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead. It's alright, baby. Please. It's for your own good. I lied. ...I've seen things. In there. Last night. You did too. Don't tell me you didn't. You were crying like a baby. Just a bad place. And the doorway to worse. Maybe once upon a time. But that was long ago. Back before... before it became what it is. Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there. I don't want you meeting around that house. You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog. You got a vision, girl. Just like I got. Just like my momma had. And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures. That's just wasted time. Aren't you going to join us? Should I? That building? No thanks. I'm not joking boy. Don't feed it. It'll only make it hungrier. Then your father's a dead man and Jimmy Bones is gonna be around a long time. The blood is still there. We just gotta figure out where. ... see there ain't just two parts to a person. There's three. Body-Soul and Spirit. The spirit lives in the blood. It's the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on. Jimmy's blood must still be in the house. You sure we oughta save him? Why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling? You're pretty black to be growing up in Rossmore Park. You look mighty familiar to me. You sure you're not from around here?That, that was business ... No, this is pleasure ... ...you told me you were studying for your examination by the Studiolo ... How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind... My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men. Well, perhaps sometime we... And yet, they are not know for their cuisine. You know it? My husband brought it to me from America. And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture? ...get me a cigarette. ...and then, we're going to Greece ... Oh, my program ... It's a joke . You're a joke. You're a joke. You don't know what money is -- your idea of money... ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.' That is the fine limit of your ambitions... ....because we don't have any mmm... Because we cannot pay ... Then we cannot go. Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if you get it, will not buy me a new watch ... ...they asked us to dinner. How can we accept if we cannot return the... Because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here... We are here on sufferance. I am here... ...and that is what you need to expand. Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera... They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken. No, you're wrong about Verger. Who would that be. And why is it a vacant exercise? Who are these guys...? ...they did it for a lark. Let's keep it to business, shall we? You want me to be? That's the spirit... Then who's buying it? Say it in English. Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income. Now, whyn't you help us? Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles... Here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell. Waal, because your selling 'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand? And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. We got a bunch of materials , coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books . Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you? I'm looking for... ...you... You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward. I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. What have they got you doing? ...how are things at the Hospital? It's a poor workman who blames his tools. It wasn't my day. Well. Word gets around. Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...? Then why did you chose to inform me of it...? I hereby acknowledge that... I have not read you your rights. I almost shot the baby ... What, What, I can't hear you... I know her by the Back. All Quiet Along the Potomac... Then I'm doing fine. M'I gonna see you tonight? Hard up as you are, at your age? Whadda you care? Surrender. How crazy is that.... How crazy is that. ...they're sending me. Out to get Shot. Hounding me.... they're... I feel... I feel they're Out to Get Me... Then you tell me, then. I'm not. You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready.... All y'got to do is ask ... COULD I GET A DRINK , N'I don't care , you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' makework , than be doin' pub'l'relations with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one Hispanic , one Librarian , one Jew , and One from Column A, and One from Column... Thank you. Hey, I'm fine. Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...? Tell him to give it to an orphanage. No, no, of course not. You should get the kids a dog ... And how would you know that? He is...? We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records. Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him. But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's... What reaction? Now, why in the world would he do that? What would that be? I won't take much of his time. I've never heard that he... The children...? Reinstatement to what ? There ain't nobody there... I know you did what you could. I am all attention. Yes sir, I saw it. Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a hobbyist ... Am I on that case, sir...? ...standard issue... ...what'm I looking at...? You seen John Brigham...? He once made me an improper suggestion. Why would you say that? Because he sent me in there to be killed...? What is this...? One moment, and they're at the Seven- Eleven . They botched the fallback plan, they... I don't mind being the token woman , what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token man ... who are these Warriors, ï¿½our cobbled together Strike Force? I'm in the room with a fugitive felon... ..I was instructed that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special... I could have acted on my own. I was told... Sir: Give it up. Give it up, Evelda. Waal... I said how's your baby...? How's your child ? I said sometime it gets so... It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.

Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE) I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition. Evelda Drumgo? I could of took her down in a snap of the fingers -- But -- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement... Due respect, you don't , sir, your precious Joint Operation. FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet soup , we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't... And I'm telling you: You wanna throw a Birthday Party: Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's fine , but... THEN WHERE WAS IT? I'm sent out there... I'm told that the arrest must be a joint... Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous... Sir, with all due respect.... I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy... And how did he do that? ...and my need for The Institution... ...we were speaking of my father ... Thanks to you ... What is that that smells so wonderful. Thank you. No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you find me so..." I'm going to cut you loose. With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...? Do right and you'll live through this. Can you walk? Are your legs working...? Give me your gun... Why? What would you guess, Ardelia? Trouble is, they all seem to die . Yeah. Well. They're a talkative buncha commentators. No. ...what...? Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work. ...something about my father ...? I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine... No. I want to buy a dog. I don't wanna go out there at all ... Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room. Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it? My daddy would say: accept with glee the things you cannot change. I'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet. Because you're going to help me plan a party. ...not to turn around. I am no going to show you the secret handshake ! Yeah, well, they solved that: turns out, he'uz a cannibal ... Yeah, but who would marry friendless me ... Howabout you, Romeo...? That's what I should do. Tell me why? No, that is code-word material, that's what that is.... Oh baby, oh baby.... Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate me, though.... Well. Excellent ... I'm... Alcohol. Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities... ...not unlike some Hindu God ... I want the same drink. Cause it did me good ... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another. I din't solve it, I didn't ' solve it '. I just sat a dance out with him. Facts, facts, facts. Facts , close the case, cavalier. Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"... Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them... Do you. What does that mean? ...this one is my favorite. It has not title. They should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...? Waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in Alexandria Virginia, n'that's where I'm going, cause I'm goin home , f'i can get n'y'one, Of That Nature, to take her there... Or clear your windshield with it. No,I get it, this is my Cavalier . This gents my Italian Knight. Take this ... For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle. The great and beautiful ... I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would kill you. Hey, lost again. Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling. No, y'know, I never doubted it... But they were not there. Yesterday . Is that called a Delusion...? But. He was a night watchman . That's what he was. N'They brought back, his hat, his badge , an his timeclock . N'then they took me off. I saw ... I saw. Clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion ? His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all. And. I always said, he was a P'lice officer. And all he left us: the Country brought back his hat , and his badge ... both with a bullethole in them. An' that's what he left us. That's what I said. He was shot ...he was shot. On his rounds. And... and... ...why? Yes. I want to do something positive ... I.. What is your point? Yes. That's right. I don't understand. But... but....but.... you're right . I used it. To bargain . For her sympathy ... I used it--to "whore myself out"-- I told that woman I'm an orphan. Yes. For approval. If he could overcome... his need for... for self- ratification ... I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb... Yes. Well, no... That's... I appreciate your help , but... ...no. No, I don't think so... ...no... ...no... I don't know. Do you know...? I don't think so. No. That's right. That's all part of it. ....that's right. Well, you know, you know, you know, the point is: I can't tell you. Cause you haven't been there. You haven't done it . And that's all there is . I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand. Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings. ...sir...? Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources. Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property. Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids have been placed on them. I have to ask if you've placed those bids. No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible? I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction...No. Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald. Now what? What did I do this time? Okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...First of all, little Jason has a learning disability... Yeah. And? This is not the way it was supposed to-- I was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- I don't even like smoking! I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl. The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle. I'm not a nai-ive little... Why do you even like me? Geez, what time is it? I have to go feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right, I miss him. Wichita, that is. I really want to be with him, but I can't bring myself to--Are you a lesbian or are you... You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking. What are you doing? I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth? I don't know about you dickweeds, but I gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump. Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body... Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss-- Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up! Isn't Fun great! Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever. You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out... Yes! God yes! I would tell her that I love her! To not let anyone take away her dreams..! Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love? Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different. I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died. Iunno. Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible for you to make me feel worse, but...you're saying you deliberately destroyed us! I don't even get I'm- sorry-it-was-the-heat-of-the- moment... WICHITA I know, I'm...I'm evil. WENDY Oh that's right, baby, you're so "evil." You're, you're so "dark"... WICHITA We should get back. WENDY You're not evil or dark...you're just scared. Something more interesting than that...How could you? How could--! Ah, our last night at camp...I always knew it would be something special. This isn't about "doing it." I just think we need to talk some things out privately before... Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you... Be nice. Her father died in that TWA flight the government shot down...You know I'm going to be in the city next week. My mom says it's okay that I stay overnight at your dorm...It'll be nice to see you in a different shirt. WICHITA Oh, I didn't tell you. I wear this all year round. The chicks dig it... Do you really think we're fooling anyone? Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier... Are you allowed to do it more than once a night? Probably. Fuck off. Don't worry, you... I love you. Don't say I love you, too. I hate that--"love you, too." And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but... About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop. Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I almost did something. Iunno. What else don't you believe in? Do you really not believe in God? Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud. I think your condescension is even better. Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you? Yeah. I guess I do. We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much... Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote... Hey. I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.What is it? Do you think it goes all the way across? This is how you make dinosaurs? Eric! He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs. Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids. ERRR-IIIC! I would completely support that. I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently. We should try fishing again. But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that. How would you have helped Eric? He needs you, Paul. He needs us. You couldn't have made that jump. Paul! Where is he? Can you see him? Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me. Sweetheart, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. What?...WHAT!? Think. When did you have it last? He would have been, safe. Completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe. I would have him to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that you have to be here. This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years. Well what? We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere. We have to help him. He's this way. Eric! Itï¿½s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone. No, it's... I filmed this the morning they left. Eric... Just drop it Paul! Nothing. Nothing. Oh, don't worry about that. Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric. Dr. Grant is looking for the coast. Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that... Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area. So do you. You hate to swim. How much weight have you lost? Nothing you haven't seen before. A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back. We can't just... What's a bad idea? What? From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want. ...once-in-a-lifetime. We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight. It is truly, whatï¿½s the word? Inspiring. You had the phone the whole time? What about Eric? What about Eric and Dr. Grant? He's not a kill, he's still alive. I thought we weren't suppose to yell. He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand. You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low. Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay? Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much. I know. I know. I want to look for him too. Just hold on. PAUL!Right. See ya. Thanks Coco. I'll let you know. Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind. Sorry to trouble you, Coco. You're really something Coco...thank you. Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town. Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together. It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ... I was afraid of that. Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much. Wow! It's unbelievable! I can hardly wait, Coco. No, I don't. I guess I've come to quite a place. Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that. I... Well, I ... Yes, he is. He raises corn. Hi...do you work with my Aunt? Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked. Are you okay? I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right? I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming. No, no, I'm fine. Hi. Very pleased to meet you. Yes. Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before... I can call them... I can call my dad. You're still here? Betty. What? Was anyone hurt? Can you tell me what happened? Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. Well ... we'll leave her a note. But it said #12. Diane? Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet. No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be. Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money. I know what you have to do, but let me do it. Rita... I know what you're doing. C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door. Keep going. Go around to the back. Do you know them?! What is it? What do you see?! You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble. Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you! When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go. I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich! You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn. Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one? "Before I kill you." "Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..." "Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... " "You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work." "I can call them... I can call my dad... " "My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..." "You're still here?" I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out. What's wrong with that? Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are. Call the number. Strange to be calling yourself. We'll take our check. Not that I can see. Come on... let's find you something to wear. Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive. We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident. Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call. Mulholland Drive? When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything? The money. You don't know where it came from? You don't remember anything else? How do you remember how to talk? Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything? Well... what do you think about then? I mean... well what do you think about? What do you mean? You're Rita. What's wrong? What is it Rita? All right, but...I'm going to check on you. If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep. But, this could be serious. Oh... She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel. I...I mean......I...it's none of my business. Thank you... thank you very much. Betty Elms. Yes, Sir. No, we don't. Wally Brown. To my audition.Good luck, honey! Get going. You don't want to be late. Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that. His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever. It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong? Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it. So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her. Sweetie, look at me straight. She wants to know who's staying in her apartment. Your Aunt called me. You got it! See you later honey. Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there. I told ya. That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one. Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it. Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another. You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class. You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass." Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too. I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.Okay, but you don't know what you're missing. I'm just offering a place to stay. I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place. Will you meet with him? Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be. It's been a very strange day. Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away. Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea. Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy? I know, but you're broke. Where are you? You're broke! Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls. I know. Where are you Adam? Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do. Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam! You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this. Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam! They fired everyone. They've closed the set. They sent everybody home. Adam, where are you?My name is Rita. I think so. I was just taking a shower. A car ... a car accident. There was an accident. I came here. That's okay.I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff. I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right. Number 17. Yes?It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new. But I want to. What ... I..HAVE... to do. No. I don't think... No... but... Those men in front, in the car. Don't stop! But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble. Okay. Good luck! Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here? I'm all right. "Then they'd put you in jail." "Before what?" "What about you? What will your dad think about you?" "You know what I want...it's not that difficult." "But you won't..." "So... surprise"... "Really?" "I came back. I thought that's what you wanted." I'm not sure about this. Maybe...maybe ... maybe. It's not my voice ... but I know her. Maybe it's not me. No. Just the coffee. There's nothing? Okay. Okay... but just...just to see. No.... I don't... That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive. Mulholland Drive. Unh, unh. No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here. I don't know. Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it. What do you mean? I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!! I don't know who I am. I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ... It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep. No...I need to sleep. No. I think I've been hurt. She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think. No ..........I.So beautiful! Well...sure. He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have. I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe? We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us. He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him. You were more like brothers. He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you. Were. Isn't that what you mean? Were. Because he's dead, isn't he? And that's why you've come. You take care, Dorie. Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect? What do you get for winning? How often you fight like this? I'm Evelyn. And I'm just a nurse. But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar. Whatta ya say? What's your name? Win? How'd you get this? Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here. Our doctor's gone too. It was. I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something. You think I made a choice, of Danny over you. I didn't. I didn't have a choice. I'm pregnant. They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go. That's what I have to tell you, Rafe. It wasn't a choice. It -- Rafe... No. You forgive me. Rafe -- There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just -- It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote. It's just that -- I thought you were dead. And now -- It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they -- It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead. I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you? How did you?... Why were you sitting here, instead of... Do one thing for me, before you go. I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe. You waited til tonight to tell me? But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you -- We're all going away. It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way. Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say. I was hoping to meet him. Danny's not coming? Oh, this is Betty. You too, Lieutenant.The real question is, where are the plates? If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation. They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black. In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran. We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press. The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market. It's much more than a counterfeit. 14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference. The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses. They think I'm a crooked customs agent. Look, I've been working this case for months now... We need to get out of sight. Come down to my suite. I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service. You see, no bomb. Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction. I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht. And it's his party. The S.S. Minow Johnson. Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon." Well, I'm very tempted. It's such a beautiful yacht. What's it called? El Capitan? This is your ship? I don't think so. Isabella Molina, from San Juan. That seat is taken. Now you know. I'm fine. I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service? Dip me! The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in. If I'm wrong then my cover is blown. Behind me is the soft count room. We're pretty sure the plates are back there. Look over there. That's the eye in the sky room. You move well. I'm undercover. I had no choice. You have to trust me. I need your help. Put your arms around me. Yes. They've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there's only one way to spot a fake. It wasn't hard to spot the fakes until this past year. Then Tan got hold of one of a kind Swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills. No. It's a sample. You guys ever heard of the Superbill? I know who you are, Inspector Lee.Well then, when you get older you can do something about it. It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it. For rape and murder. I know! I am sure. He wasn't. Jesus was not bad. Poison gas. He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed. He's dead. My grandchild-baby. My baby. My Jesusï¿½ Mi Jesus esta muerto! Mi Jesusï¿½mi jesusï¿½ No. This is work. I'm always working. No, Mikey. I'm still poor. We had to work. My family was poor. I did not go to high school. No. It was God's will. Four brothers and five sisters. Yes. Yes, Mikey?What's an audience going to tell you? We're not ready! We're not ready. I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screeningï¿½ I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity? You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma? I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation. This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative. This is definitely better. The camerawork's nice. No, you don't. You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people. Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.OK. Bye. Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back? Eight, six, and four. Three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But not any more. That's good. Hunh. I do. Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom. Oh? Anything I might have seen? That's good. So then what do you do now? That's too bad. Anything I might know about? Oh, that's too bad. I believe it. Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting? Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting? Yeah. But...you called. So what's going on? Great! Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you? Who is this? Hello?I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize. That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine. Marcus...You'll write something better next time! You know he hated my story also. Don't be so upset. It's OK... I was never much of a sweater. You know that. Marcus, I'm tired. That's all. You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral. I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good. Well then, maybe you should just read the ending. Oh. What happens now? You mean, again? Huh? NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!... Nigger, fuck me hard!!... Nigger, fuck me hard! Fuck me hard! Nigger. ...gger. Ni... Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that. It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high? Thanks. Thank you for being honest. Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer? Aren't you going out with Catherine? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean... Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer. And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit. Good. 'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was... Can I join you? Yeah, um, then...are you alone? I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all. What are you doing here?Thanks, Cleo. See you tomorrow. Hello? My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are? Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out. Heee hee-haaa.... It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls! Cleo, I've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie? Everything's fine. I'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down. Wayne Gretzky. I've got to get that. Relax. I'll see you tomorrow. She thinks you went to the police. That's right. Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns! Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it? Hee-hee hee... Of course - of course! Hands in... So then this isn't crazy. It's a sure bet. If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard? That's right. So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes. C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time. Look, I might be moody. I might be gassy. But I am perfectly sane. Think about it. In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true." Right? "Positive" you're sure I'm not fat or "positive" I'm... You sure? No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat. No...I've been pregnant. Huh-ha-wha? Ahh! I'm under the ice! I'm uh -- oh...man... That was a weird one. Jus some girlie things for the squad. That was gas, Sweetie. Uh, Jack - look, I can explain... If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over. Mmm-hmmm... I know, but that was before. Jack, I think I should get a job. Trix... Jack... Jack, sweetie, I'm only eating for two. Oh, Jack... I sure do. So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this. I see a flower. And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt. Well, if I had to guess... I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own... Jack, do you know what I see here? ... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up? Hi, Jack. ...do not accept charity. We are two young, able-bodied Americans. We do not want a handout. We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow. Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it! Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down. If not, have a nice day, Ma'am. No. Wait! Did I say Promise! Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?! What?! But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records... Don't use big bills! Yeah, hold on. Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you. Oh no... Hee-hee-h-wait a minute. Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game? NO! Wait...um... We're the A-squad from Lincoln High? So, uh... Oh, thank G-d! I'm not just super fat! It's all my fault. I'm sorry I ever started this... Kansas! Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship? And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money. Your mom only shot a guy... Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day... You sure I'm not fat? "No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat? He is the Great One... Madonna. I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?" Well, I want to know what happened -- Ooops, that's me -- gotta run! No. This is Diane. I think you have the wrong number. Hello? Yeah? You're kidding. Hey, hey, hey. C'mon you guys. Obviously that's a little more than our budget will allow. Basically, we're looking for something around two-hundred dollars. Bullets? No bullets! Oh my gosh, these are just to scare people. Kinda like round-off, back handspring, whip back, double full. You never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you've got it. Ammo? Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five. Five should do it. I guess there's an exception to every rule. Hold on... Ooops, hold on a sec. Hannah, we've... Hello? That's okay, Hannah. It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. Sex - you can learn from movies. But robberies? There's no way. Or that! Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby. I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand. I could open that safe in my sleep! And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises. Don't Martha-fucking-Stewart me! If you don't like it - you try being a pregnant teen! I know, Hannah. Look, I'm not going to get an abortion. I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep. 'Course, that was a long-long time ago. But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep. Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby. Hey. I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one... ... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?You damn well better... Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate. Where's my smokes? You got that big retarded girl down there? Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals. Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands? Is that you down there? Kansas?Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty." NO-GAH-BUH- NO! Rule number two - NO NAMES! NO GODDAMN NAMES, you retard! Hey! Rule number one - never take off the mask! Y'hear me! No matter what happens, NEVER TAKE OFF THE MASK! This is great - GREAT! Now we have to enter the front door! Who are you - the goddamn Bionic Woman?! You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs. Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes. You piece-a-shit bug zapper! Shut up, Cleo. Di, how much do you need for an abortion? For a pack of cigs? I use her food stamps. Just call me later. I gotta get some smokes for Grandma. That you? She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning. It was Lucy! Lucy went to the cops! He Ikea'd us. Hey. Eyes on your own belly! We were told you could "fix us up." Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load! We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals! I'm gonna visit my mom! Di, it's not your fault. We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves. I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies -- Shut up. Stop, you're gonna make me cry. Uh, "no"... You're not fat. Hat-trick? We're here for you, Diane. Nope. Sounds more like the first. Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm. And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying. I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry. Uh...Yeah, Grandma. She doesn't mean that. Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke. Thanks! That'd be great. Oh yeah, you caught us... Shit! Yeah, Grandma. Me and the squad. Screw Lucy! Bank branch! All of you! Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest. 'Cause I will Jerry Springer you faster than you can say "Fat-assed lesbian!" You sure you wanna go there? Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!" Wait a minute. You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?! Oh my G-d! I'm not first! Hold up, hold up. Any sentence that starts with "at church camp" ain't leading to the big "O." Hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a Christian virgin run the board. Your kind is pure of heart - the devil won't dick with you. Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here. Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom! Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here? Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too? I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it. I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank. My best friend got pregnant. Okay, you can't tell anybody. Your help. I don't hate you. I need your help. They could kill you. You shouldn't smoke so many of those. Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl. They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me. What the hell do you want? I mean it. I'm in. This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had. If one of us needs something, we all do. Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in. More proof God's a guy...Better enjoy it now. 'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory. It's twins!! Forget it. I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head. I won't risk it. Cleo! You just became a statistic! WHAT?! That's insane!!! Why would I go to the police? Di, it's Luce. Kansas just called and said she's going to "fuck me up!" Then I heard coughing, a thud and Kansas had to go. I think her Grandma had another heart attack. Anyway, why does she want to "fuck me up?" -- We practice! Sorry, Cleo. Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four. But, we have to make a smart plan! Well... ... I don't know. Probably not. No. And they get caught! Oh my G-d, I read about this! It's called a "pregnancy insanity." Quick, she needs a sitz bath -- Positive. Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat! I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say. Look, you're fat, Diane. You're fat, fat, fat! Because you eat, eat, eat! What?! She keeps asking because she wants some honesty. Oh my G-d, you've been robbed! Diane? Diane! Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone. Promise! Definitely old. Yeah. "Itchy" sent us. I want to help. I'm part of this squad... Stop it! This is crazy! ...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm! Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.Wait, Petunia. Mommy's a little amped up - didn't get her yard time this morning. Mink ain't my bitch. She's a specialist... in banks. What?! Hush up, you mouthy little shit! Kansas, I want you to meet someone special. So you need my help? Oh my G-d, this is like asking me for help with your homework. Hey, Mink, c'mere! Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever... Before you? Whoo-hoo! Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk. Whaddya want? Now how the hell can I help you? My what? So could half the women in here. And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for? To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me... I know, but it keeps down the size of my can. Thank G-d. I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.'Please remember that Dr. Furtwï¿½ngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.' I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives. When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here. Don't see me to my door, there's no need. What does he mean, too correct? And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on. And no elbows on the table! Oh! And don't wave your hands about! That's because you had a proper upbringing. I would like to go now, please. But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested. I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him. I can't do this. It's not right. I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all. Of course. Bruckner's Seventh, Major. Major, Major... he's here ... I'm sorry. The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwï¿½ngler? No. Ours was damaged. But... he only wrote nine, Major. Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony. There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is. Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck. My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families. Three months. Yes. Yes.Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please-- It's OK... ...I wanted to make you happy. But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane... You're an enthusiast. I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are? I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though. ...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian. But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally. It doesn't matter, Mr Crane. But more or less. ...I stank, didn't I? Geez, Mr Crane. Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff. Oh, Mr Crane-- Boy. Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school. That's what he keeps telling me. Pop doesn't like people smoking in here. We've certainly missed you. We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry. Hello, Mr Crane. Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane. Hi, Mr Crane. Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow. He was deaf when he wrote this. I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear. It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright. I knew we'd pay for it. ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store. Should I... should I tell you why? I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them. I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that. ...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it. I don't know what's going on. I-- Honey. It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure. Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it. 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful. ...What's so damn strange about that? That means I don't run Nirdlinger's! ...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex. Ahh... Dave. ...What a knucklehead. Oh, don't be a grump. Come on, get ready. It's important. Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push. Honey?...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy. I know who you are, Mr Crane. He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas. Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig van Beethoven.You don't own this place. Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I... Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat. Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have? He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit. No. What are you looking for? I don't know. I just want to try it. Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews. Lina, come here! I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like... Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish. 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi. Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly? Do they? It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews. Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter. I told you, I'm good at this. Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... The book's closed. You think I should just because there's no reason? Why should I submit? Fuck that. And belief follows? What's it about? Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing. V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing? Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem... With you there's a tragic dimension. The sex is better. Where are they? It looks a little like a swastika. Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles? What assholes. That's stupid. Why not? I'm good at languages. Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay? I want to learn to read it. What's it mean? Oh, yeah... 'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here... But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right? Do you know it like that? By heart. How come there's no punctuation? Where'd you get this? No. He's at a home out here. You can't. I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda? Who's Linda? Bigger and better. Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now. I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one. You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends. That's stupid. Why would they? Killing himself. I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that. He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on. They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met. "And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..." Why no silencer? Where'd you read all that stuff? You're not in school? What do you do? Which is what? Disease? What disease? Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio? Nobody reads that stuff anymore.You shut up. Who do you think you are? Danny, I'm trying to -- save you. Think about your father. Your sister. And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it. All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them.... So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me? It was a nine millimeter. You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use? Which <i>Times</i> guy? I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants. Tell me about Lina Moebius. This is me. You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa. Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking. I thought you hated Torah. Why did you come tonight? To see me? The arguments, anyway.We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already. He's Jewish? Manzetti? It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been. Did you see how they reacted to him? Danny, please, we don't want to know. Are you out of your mind?! Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay? What? I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they? So what? Do you have a suit? Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us? We think you'd be good at it. We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising. Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now. Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things? I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
