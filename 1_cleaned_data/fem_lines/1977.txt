See ya, Bandit. What are you thinking? Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things... I know what you're thinking. I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right? He's just exhausted. Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate. Well, thanks for the lift. One to five? Why are you stopping? What are you gonna do when you get home? What kind of a guy is he? -- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer. They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit. My very words. He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister. -- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage. We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it. Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now. Ummm? Yeah? You take the front, I'll take the back. How do you know? Then let's change the subject. What do you think about forced school busing? You plan on driving trucks all your life? Do I know? I'm an authority on it. You plan on driving trucks all your life? Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'. Uh-oh. -- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds... You want to lose this putz or not?!? Like what? You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection. Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse. Yeah. I would've come back for you. I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out. He's after us again! Ciao. Jesus!!! Enjoy your Kenworth. Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time. Nice meeting you. It's been a trip. Eleven. I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome. We lost him. You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor. See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless. I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us. You know, you're not a bad driver. What do you want to be when you grow up? Can I ask you something? We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn. What the hell's going on? You just passed your nemesis. Guess what? Seriously?!? Where you from? You have a great profile. Driving, talking to me... Is this fun? No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey? Well?... So tell me about yourself. Eyes on the road. An existentialist. But you could get killed, right? A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity. Why are you doing this obviously macho feat? Who'd want to? Why? You have a bowling date? Why're you driving so fast? Kate McConnell. Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke? Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right? Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent. Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite. Bandit two, you read me? How's your twenty? I'm Kate. You must be Cledus. What's he... Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa? Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over. Who's Fred? Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu... This is Bandit I. Over. Believe me, that won't be a problem.You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me. The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House? Then everybody's in in the conspiracy? Lyndon Johnson? Yeah, Earl Warren? Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right? We've been through this. Alvy. Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention. Portchnik. Allison. Do you feel all right? Yes. Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know. It's okay. Why not? Yes. Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act. Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next. Who are you?How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more? Who's persecuting? She stole! She was going through my pocketbook! SO? She was stealing. His wife has diabetes!Oh! The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards. If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight. I'm late. Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh? You're mad, aren't you? No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends. Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself. That's right, that's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles. What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice." Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know? I mean... I'm able to enjoy people more. Oh, Alvy, come on. Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice. I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan. Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem- Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh! What? Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway? Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that. Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm. God. Oh- Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine. Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do. Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine. Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working. Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful? It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day. Oh, good. Okay. Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room. Yeah. Nothing at all? Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you. Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him. God, it's so clean out here. God. No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here. Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not? Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun. That's sick! You never wanna try anything new, Alvy. Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman. I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win. But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself. And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him. Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex. Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied. That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time. All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do? I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people. Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing... ...yeah... yeah. Thing? What thing? Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh? Oh! My God! Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway? Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God! Oh, you knew I wanted this... God, it's terrific, God! What... huh? Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it. Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's- What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding? Oh, darn it. Yeah, but it's real close. Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday. Holy cow! -me, my God, it's a great day! Yeah. Okay, okay. Okay. Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could- You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah. Living together hasn't been so bad, has it? Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart. Yeah. Yeah? I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice. Was there somebody in your room when I called you? Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy? Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch. Oh, don't go, okay? Please. It's for my complexion. Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with- I think I left it there, I'm sorry. Oh, I-I left it at your house. Two? Yeah? Oh. What? Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times. It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom. I got the good chocolate, Alvy. Would you like a glass of chocolate milk? Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired. Well, I like to try to get all points of view. It was just great! Yeah. I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher. No. I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom. My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects. There's a big black spider in the bathroom. There's a spider in the bathroom. Oh. I just think we oughta call this relationship quits! And what are you doing following me around for, anyway? A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher! And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough. Life. I said, "life." No, I didn't. I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy. Will it change my life? Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife? Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses. She said, your name was Alvy Singer. and I keep, you know, it's- Yeah, and he's strangling me... In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe. Yeah. Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried. M'hm. And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love. Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children. M'hm. And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that? And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother. Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman. I'm home! It's his name. You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him! Who cares? Who cares? We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat. Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about! "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close. Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase. That is the worst kind of paranoia. Do you realize how paranoid you are? Well, what is your definition of following? You followed me! You followed me. I can't believe it! It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you. No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think- Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too. Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat. Were you always funny? M'hm. Well, I need grass and so do you. Oh, you have my body. Let's just do it, all right? U-huh. No, I'm fine. Uh-uh-why? Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. M'mrnm. What are you doing? Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time. Well, what's the difference, anyway? It relaxes me. Well, have you ever made love high? Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay? What? Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight? Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel." Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something? You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about. Yes, it is. That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy. How is it any different? I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? Mine. You don't want me to live with you? That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs. I have a tiny apartment. Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why. Of course. I dunno. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah... yeah. Do you love me? Yeah. Do I love you? Come on. Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you. Ooooh! Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is. No, I'm not. You see, like you and I... Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Oh! Italian, right? Yeah. M'hm. Yeah. Yeah. M'hm. U-huh. M'hm. Yeah. M'hm. M'hm. M'hm. Yeah? Yeah? That's, uh... that's pretty serious stuff there. H'm? What? What? Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first. Yeah? Here, you want some? No. You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me. No. You're a wreck. Yeah? Oh, yeah? H'm? M'm, that was so nice. That was nice. Oh. Oh. And your first wife was Allison? Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that? We can digest our- Yeah. Okay. Oh, all right. Yeah. Really? What? Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either. Yeah? Really, do you think so, really? No, I'm gonna quit! Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me. I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing. Yeah. it's my first time. Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't- But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna- gonna sing. Yeah. what I mean? Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know- I know. Oh... nothing. Not-no, no! Me? Oh, uh. No. Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh? Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know. Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh. Well, uh... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew. Yeah. Oh, God bless! Fifteen years, huh? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess- Oh, I see, I see. Why not? Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club? Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know. Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh... Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so... George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was... shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. Anyway, so, so... George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so... so, he's dead ... he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate. Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie... Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh... Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie. Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane. Neat, yeah. Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know. Oh, yeah. M'hm... Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really? Fifteen years? Oh, you see an analyst? Okay. You sure? Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ... Oh, yeah, yeah. Well... I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it? Yeah, I know. Yeah, my grammy. Yeah. Oh. Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well... Huh? Oh... yeah. Don't be funny. Huh? Oh, yeah. Huh? Oh, right. Oh, you do? Yeah... so, listen-you drive? All right. Okay, that's good. Okay. Well, where is it? I- Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- a very good driver. So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway? Wisconsin. No, Chippewa Falls. Well, I do commercials, sort of... Oh, I'm in her acting class. I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone. Yeah, well, I'm, but I... Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too. Me? Oh, downtown! I don't... I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there... What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift? Oh, no, I have a car. Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car? Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta- whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie. Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la. Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door. Hi. Hi, hi. Oh, I'd say so. You married- Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls. Oh, really? Well, la-de-da! He was creepy. Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger. Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School. Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No. It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely! Great! Great! Goddammit! Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please! Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera. All right. All right. All right. Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay. I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water. Get him! Oooh! Here! Here! Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here. Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake. Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There. Alvy, now don't panic. Please. I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first. I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all. I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice. I-you know, I don't wanna. Alvy, I... That movie makes me feel guilty. M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture. Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh? Oh! Stop it, Alvy! I know- because of our sexual problem, right? The alarm clock. I missed my therapy. I overslept. Well, stop listening to him. H'h, that's a polite word for what you are. Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis. Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do? Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that? Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in. In the middle? We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish. Two minutes, Alvy. I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period! Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right? You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it. Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay? I just have time to get the, uh- You think so? Do you really? No. Yes, I do. Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play? Oh, yes, yes. We really had a good time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh. Oh. I don't know, this is strange to me, you know. Oh, gosh. Oh. Hey- Yeah. Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey. Oh. What about? No, no, no, not at all. Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot. Oh, yeah, really, oh! Well, hi! Oh.You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, is that what you said? Oh, I-I don't understand. Are you joking, or what? Whatta you mean? Oh, when'd you quit smoking? What are you making such a big deal about? They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.M'mmm. We're going to take them to the airport. Oh, he's adorable, Annie. Now, don't let it be so long, now. Oh, you remember her, Annie. Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you. We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.Where are you going? Oswald and ghosts. I have a headache. My head is throbbing. I can't. Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium? I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York. Dammit! I was so close. Oh, I'm sorry! There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think? Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility. Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop? Here you are. There's people out there. No jokes-these are friends, okay? Commentary. Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart." Why are you so hostile?Where will we go? I have nothing to go back for. Alice? ...never doubt what you are doing. Yes. I want you to go. Our father? Did you see my father? Are we safe? What is it? No. I will find you. What would you have me do? They're going to hang you. Why didn't you leave when you had the chance? What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? Mr Poe? Much further? On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring... to my blood... ...than any imagining could possibly have been... You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London... In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. Why were those people living in this defenseless place...? And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with? How did you learn English? I'm sorry. Thank you so much. "We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...? Why did they turn back? What?! He did? Your "father"? You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you. You knew them. Why didn't you bury those people? I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference. Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial! Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too! "Justice"? If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people. He knew the consequences. And he stayed. Are those the actions of a criminal? ...Duncan, do something. There was no letter. There was none! When? How? What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan! Yes. Go ahead. They do not live their lives "by your leave." ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way. You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this. I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said... beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. I am sorry, Duncan... Duncan... Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment. He delivered no such message. My God, Alice. Yes. Yes, I will. Cousin Eugenie, my father, but... Some say that's the way of it. Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see? You still have an aversion to the water? I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive... after so long apart and after you've traveled so far...
