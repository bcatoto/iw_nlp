Wait! First I give you special fuck! You call me Linda, just like home. You like to call me Linda now? I show you. Come. You come. Linda have special, crazy fuck. That right? How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda? I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much! Everybody love Linda.I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine. I'm just so lonely. I don't know. That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air. I see you're going hunting. You're going hunting? What are you doing? Nick? Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now. No-o-o! Oh, it's great. Fine. Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk -- Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now. Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee. Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out. Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from. I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off. But -- Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound? How are you? Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so! I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... I thought someone stole you away! I don't know. Sure. I don't know! I don't know either! Okay. What? I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking -- I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking -- I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because... Oh... You know... Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.He shouts, too. Huh? You blame everything on kids. What happened? Hi, Dad. What happened? Saving the treats for Bob? What time? All right. The Wallaces leave at seven. I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda. Old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. His parents grounded him for the weekend. He can't come over tonight. We just talked. That's not true. Here I am. Why didn't you wait for me? He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so. If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning. He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul. I can't. This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window... You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up. You guys will make a fabulous couple. Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him. What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night? I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like. For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her. I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout. What's the pumpkin for? That's probably all he can do. Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven. Probably Mister Riddle. Lies. You still spooked? Bye. I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30. Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie. I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me? Of course. Why did you hang up on me? Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later. It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much. Poor Laurie. You scared another one away. Subtle, isn't he? Hey creep! I don't see anything. Look where? Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you. I have a place for that. I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me... Come with me. Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other... Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul. Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off? I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck. Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room! Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again. Get him out of here!You're going to be late! You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie. The only things missing were some Halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. What does that sound like to you? Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids. What? Hi, Annie, Laurie... Where? Where were you? I went back to the Myers house... I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out. More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse. Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes. You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong. Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this... You all right? I'll check back in an hour. I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations... What do we do? Looks like to me you're just plain scared. A man wouldn't do that... Come on... A skunk could have killed it... Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted. Ten minutes. May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here... Lee Brackett.Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded. Wait a minute here... Yes, you can. I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around. Fancy. Annie! Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't. I'd say you must have the wrong number. What's this big, big news? Thanks. I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied. He can still watch. He was watching me. I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard. I wasn't spooked. Sure, see you later. I've already lost it. I thought it was an obscene phone call. Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death. Annie, was that you? Hello? Okay. Bye. The guys think I'm too smart. Cute. He was standing right here. That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at. Behind that bush there. Look. I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company. I forgot my chemistry book. Shit! Exploring uncharted territory? What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. Have a good time. They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed. No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul. Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight. Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble. I don't think so... I thought you were babysitting tonight. As usual, I don't have anything to do. I think you have too much to do tomorrow. No! Do as I say. I killed him... Yes. Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside. HURRY! DO WHAT I SAY! NOW! Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door! Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs... Tommy, let me in! I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed. Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey. I promise. And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you. We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right? What did he look like? There was no one outside. Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe. Do you believe everything that Richie tells you? There is no such thing. After the Jack-O-Lantern. After the movie. I'm so embarrassed. I couldn't face him... 'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'... Why are they under there? But king Arthur was always your favorite. ..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..." See you. Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade. Just watch. Yes, I am. Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Same time, same place. Hi, Tommy. Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand? Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door. There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed. You've had enough. Why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie. Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?I don't think this is any time to be funny... What did he say? Shouldn't we pick him up? The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on... You don't have to make this harder than it already is. What does that mean? Only minimum security. Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor. I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.' Are there any special instructions? He'll barely be able to sit up. What did you use before?Promise? Will you call me tomorrow? Michael's around someplace... My parents won't be back till ten.Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally. Not when it's like this. This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least. Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite. It's either a Great White, or another killer whale. Not necessarily. These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more. None of them are immediately fatal. Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further. Sound. Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration. And sound. Probably. This is a mammal, not a fish. What makes you think there might be? Okay, so that's it. Carcharadon Carcharias. Do you? Could be a shark. But maybe not. You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay? We don't know that, do we? What shark? The whale's mouth? The what? Length, 22 feet, 8 inches. First things first. After we've looked, we'll talk.What is it? What's the matter? What're you doing? Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work. I'll give notice. What're you going to do today? I know you did.... They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every- thing. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island.... Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is. What did they.... Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened! Because of today? The beach? That you were fired. What? What's wrong? Sean's asleep. Hi. I closed a sale today, without Len. That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through. Are you going to be able to sleep? It was bad, wasn't it. Do you? All summer? Terrific. Oh. Want to talk about it? Use the little brush there. Why were you at Santos'? Nothing, huh? Careful. What's wrong? Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair. Where were you? Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring. Thank you. I'll tell him. It's an island. Got to run. One what? Ah-ha! Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up? Where's my day book? Eat Cheerios. So's a donut. You have to smoke so early in the morning? Hey! That's my boss! As far as the office. Mrs. Silvera. Door's locked. MMMmmmorning.... Let's get the kid home. Fooling around? And how. I thought you wouldn't respect me. Why? My boss and your boss. Sure. I can see that. Don't you know this is a big deal? Where the hell were you? Be careful.... Hurry, please. I'm going. Mike? Our Mike? What Kids? Who went out?What can I tell you? He's my leader. Oh. Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms? The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice. He wants to see you. Lex Luthor. Screaming Help! I mean -- I can't stop saying it. Silly, isn't it - There's nothing to worry about. Help! See. You too. I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know? You can't do this to me! I mean the other one! Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute? Where's mine?! Where's my parachute? Danger?? Somebody??? Lex -- where are you going? What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap? Tea? What are you going to do to him? Oh. Why? does he live up here? I didn't bring any -- This all has something to do with Superman, doesn't it? I don't understand. A night on the town instead of under it? I know... I knew you'd hit me. You're not going to hit me? There was a recipe on the back -- You?! How about me? But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in -- Ready. You ever try to run in high heels? You probably did. I don't like to talk about it, Lex. The least we can do is leave him another door jam. We just take it? You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you? You're happy, aren't you? I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose. I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what? I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with -- Meteorites! Mr. Romance... I'm going to bed. See? I read the article. Krypton? The place where Superman comes from? Fifty degrees below and still falling. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen., I didn't say a word. Bet he makes it. Tough guy, huh? You think he's for real? Again??? Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner? Even that would be an improvement. Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight. So I've noticed. This?? Your father was a sick weirdo. Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.' It isn't a Park Avenue address. really. You and your real estate.Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I -- I really like the guy. And he likes me. I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me. Anytime... Oh, what a chance! If I could just -- get to him. It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl. I'm going to make some coffee. You want some? They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition. Superman. Pretty good name for him, isn't it? Of this...Superman. You're just jealous. Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip. He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors? There weren't any wires. I looked. Clark Kent, if you had only seen it the way I did, you - It wasn't a trick! I'm telling you, I was there. Not unless you can fly. There's no real proof that tobacco -- For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine. Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking. It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck. Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night. Big night coming up? What now, my love? You described the exact contents of my purse. You're great with the advice, Clark. Maybe you'd better take over the lovelorn column. Oh, for God's sake! Stop him, Clark! Hey! Not in Metropolis it isn't. This is the home of the sneak attack, the stab in the back, the -- See? Didn't I tell you this was a tough town? 'Swell.' When was the last time I heard anybody say - where are you from , anyway? Some people aren't the athletic type. Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job? Are there any more at home like you? Not...gray. I know. He sends a check every week to his dear gray-haired old mother. Your bookie? Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss. Well! Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week. It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy. Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me. Gets you where you live, huh? 'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting? He is. Usually. Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know. Okay, but...why? No offense. Here's the story on that East 19th Street murder spree. Page one with a banner headline seems about right to me. Where do you hail from? Do you like pink? Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound? What color underwear am I wearing? Do bullets really bounce off you? Is it true you're impervious to pain? Can you really see through anything? What about this X-Ray vision of yours? How much do you weigh? How old are you? It must feel great. Oh. Well, I mean it's not everybody that can deliver an air mail letter without putting a stamp on it. I didn't mean that in any pejorative way. Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours. Oh. Well, where do we start? Oh, I've got to get some matches. My cigarette. Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean. If I do, you can punish me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks. This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here. Well...flashlight? This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right? The answer is yes. Now what's the question? Wha'...what are you doing here? Superman??? With my luck, now it'll rain. Who...who... Oh, God! I'm going to die! You've got me? Who's got you???
