you dont want the extra police pay dont go playing policeman huh jimmy took it jacks out hunting with evan twombley told you the snow was coming down take the grader watch this snow its coming down tonight were looking for the funniest costume and the scariest and the most imaginative and the best costume of alltake care of the little things first the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things call chub merritt get your car back call a dentist for gods sake and get your tooth pulled dont trust the locals get your facts straight and go straight to the state police let them work on this for what wade are you alright i remember clearly cause when i heard i became real careful around pop i was a careful child and i became a careful adult but at least i wasnt afflicted by that mans violence and elbourne and mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft it wasnt me i wasnt there but i heard about it when i heard about it it was about elbourne it may have happened but not the way you said i hate to disappoint you but i dont think it happened i was thinking about that story you told me about pop and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after i care about what happened the truth im a student of history remember not particularly a hunting accident is perfect heres my theory twombley unaware of illegal union loans or whatever starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out finds out his soninlaw is involved okay its likely there are people in the union who dont want twombley to testify they probably include his soninlaw whos vicepresident and will probably be the next president i read that in the papers whats his name mel gordon they wouldnt deal with a guy like jack who else benefits if twombley is suddenly dead money well your friend i think jack hewitt that it wasnt an accident i think your first response to the twombley shooting was the correct one want to know what i think happened anything new about the shooting twombley well do you still plan to get married what about margie no thanks i dont drink what about jill is lillian bringing her havent you already done a bit of that get some sleep dont think about it youre exhausted what happened who how was she huh they were out deer hunting right jack probably heard the gun go off then came back and found the body you think jack shot him twombley he was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in new england and the construction business wade its late i know youre probably at tobys but im in bed reading we got different habits there was something it happened up your way wadeyou only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks suns gettin high yeah what happened hmm really oh you played for the sox yeah im okay and youll get your extra hundred bucks you understand what im saying i want a deer a dead one not a cripple or whatthefuck you take care of your end kid ill take care of mine you think so yeah tell you what you get me close to a big buck by ten kid theres another hundred bucks in it damn straight guaranteed eh its not enough snow not for tracking the bastards no advantage there kidhe musta found out they had to get rid of him and jackll get blamed twombley involved what is the northcountry development association as a mater of fact yes lariviere i know hes due for the last two years i was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in you dont believe me if jack told the truth he could be free by the time hes my age you know jack hewitt the kid i work with evan twombley the union boss who got shot somebody murdered him this is maybe worse than you and i are used to what im talking about im talking about murder among other things alma i think theres some dirty business going on in this town yeah sure why i got this damned tooth i got a few things bugging me like everybody else but im okay no black you got yourself a computer alma he cant fire me lariviere already did that this morning tell me yeah i know about that just tell me when youll have it fixed what are you boys up to yeah i know the custody suit thing was just my getting back at her im not as

takes a big fight after making love i like it its nice to see that in a grownup person yeah but never what you looked like not really never really studied your face like now i was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now this way i can see what you looked like as a kid no not for money but if somebodyd given me half a damned excuse i was pretty fucked up you know no i just know jacks lying about what happened he just seemed i know that kid what hes like inside hes a lot like i was at his age lots of people guy like evan twombley boston union official probably got lots of people want to see him dead the governments been investigating his links with the mafia everybody needs money except guys like twombley and that sonofabitch soninlaw of his people like that money ive been wondering if maybe jack shot twombley instead of twombley shooting himself ive been wondering maybe jack shot him on purpose im sure im positive it didnt happen the way jack says it did theres something funny about that shooting theres lots funny about it actually tonight lets get together the hell she isnt lillians been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her im gon na

destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe and somehow you and agent kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair be careful im leaving oh and austin all right austin i think you should go damn it man youre talking about my mother my god austin what have you done good god and underground missile weve long feared such a development indeed if we could get back to the business at hand its one thing to have a warhead its quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it what whats the other thing youre scared of whats the other austin vanessa let me bring you up to speed dr evil has high jacked a nuclear warhead from kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for onehundred billion dollars if the world doesnt pay up in four days hes threatening to destroy the world be careful theres one more thing austin let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation oh and austin then youll have to go it alone good luck where is vanessa by the way hello austin this is basil exposition from british intelligence thank you for confirming the link between dr evil and virtucon find out what part virtucon plays in something called project vulcan ill need you and vanessa to get on that immediately be careful oh and austin hello austin hello vanessa this is basil exposition from british intelligence theres a company in las vegas called virtucon that we think may be linked to dr evil many of the virtucon executives gamble at the hotelcasino where youll be staying thats the first place you should look well im off to the chat rooms be careful oh and austin yes wellagent kensington will get you set up shes very dedicated perhaps a little too dedicated shes got a bit of a bug up her ass good luck austin the worlds depending on you vanessas one of our top agents no austin mrs kensington has long since retired ms kensington is her daughter immediately youll be working with ms kensington we won austin a lots happened since you were frozen austin the cold wars over you might also experience a slight fever dry mouth and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation austin this is commander gilmour strategic command and general borschevsky russian intelligence the shouting is a temporary side effect of the unfreezing process youre in the ministry of defense its 1997 youve been cryogenically frozen for thirty years be careful oh and austin good luck austin im afraid not earlier this week dr evil escaped from zedel edel prison in baaden baaden and now hes planning a trap for you tonight at the electric psychedelic pussycat swingers club in picadilly circus here in swinging london i just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows whats going on at any given time weve just received word that dr evil the ultimate square is planning to take over the world hello austin this is basil exposition chief of british intelligence youre austin powers international man of mystery and youre with agent mrs kensington the year is 1967 and youre talking on a picture phonenot really kill the little bastard see what i care really theres nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan i ever dreamed of face it freedom failed well done mr powers were not so different you and i its true youre british and im belgian you have a full head of hair mine is slightly receding youre thin im about forty pounds overweight ok we are different im not making a very good point however isnt it ironic mr powers that the very things you stand for swinging free love parties distrust of authority are all now in the nineties considered to be evil maybe we have more in common than you care to admit no mr powers i expect them to die even after they pay me the money im still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma all right guard begin the unnecessarily slowmoving dipping mechanism oh forget it as a fellow player on the international stage mr powers im sure youll enjoy watching the curtain fall on the third and final act dont try to suck up to me its a little late for that im a freak look at it its been rendered useless right okay moving on youve all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet excuse me some of you i know some of you im meeting for the first time weve got a lot of work to do let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure silence and look what youve done to mr bigglesworth cant you see im only half a man look at me im a freak really are they illtempered right i have one simple request sharks with friggin laser beams attached to their heads and it cant be done remind me again why i pay you people what do we have what is it now right mr powers were going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads yes what is it youre interrupting my moment of triumph release the sharks all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads i figure every creature deserves a warm meal i like to see girls of that caliber by caliber i mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character forget it quite impressive breathtaking frau these automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate powers austin powers is getting too close he must be neutralized any suggestions my son yes the details of my life are quite inconsequential actually the boys quite astute i am trying to kill him my evil associates have cautioned against it so here he is unfortunately alive no the boys right i really am evil evil actually doctor evil scott dont say that i had the group liquidated you little shit they were insolent what did you say dont you want to see what daddy does for a living come everyone let us repair to the main chamber project vulcan is about to begin scott are you coming no scott you just dont get it do you no well leave them alone and not actually witness them dying and well just assume it all went to plan fine whatever mutated illtempered sea bass it is come lets return to dinner close the tank one more peep out of you and youre grounded lets begin i have a better idea im going to put him in an easilyescapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death in due time scott i want you to meet daddys nemesis austin powers and thats how you want to live your life is it fascinating what are your plans for this evening scott my boy come here how was your day an evil petting zoo an evil vet but scott whos going to take over the world when i die hello scott im your father dr evil i have a son i have a son everyone i have a son someday scott this will all be yours oh really onehundred billion dollars ok make it happen anything else all right then five million dollars right oh hell lets just do what we always do lets hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage gentlemen its come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days heres the plan we get the warhead and we hold the world ransom for one million dollars people have to tell me these things ive been frozen for thirty years throw me a bone here ok no problem heres my second plan back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a laser using this laser we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth which we scientists call the ozone layer slowly but surely ultraviolet rays would pour in increasing the risk of skin cancer that is unless the world pays us a hefty ransom gentlemen i have a plan its called blackmail the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money or we make it look like prince charles the heir to the throne has had an affair outside of marriage and therefore they would have to divorcei hate you i hate you i wish i was never artificially created in a lab dad we just made a breakthrough in group show me blow me i dont want to i have a gun in my room give me five seconds ill come back and blow their brains out arent you going to watch them theyll get away why dont you just shoot him now here ill get a gun well just shoot him bang dead done but what if he escapes why dont you just shoot him what are you waiting for why are you feeding him why dont you just kill him yeah what thought id stay in theres a good tittie movie on skinemax well me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and like they dont speak english right and so my buddy gets into a fight and he goes hey quit hassling me cause i dont speak french or whatever and the other guy goes something in paris talk and i go um just back off and he goes get out and i go make me you always do that anyways this is really hard because you know my dad is really evil no maybe like work in a petting zoo or something not me i havent seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship i hate you hi i just think like he hates me i really think he wants to kill me no hes really evil i dont know i was thinking maybe id be a vet or something cause i like animals and stuff i dont wan na take over the family business ok well i just really met my dad for the first time three days ago he was partially frozen for thirty years i never knew him growing up he comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business well its kind of weirdjustin shit do not do that where the fuck are you do you copy you still need the rope i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins i can see why they sent you along i heard it i am your best friend i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker will it work and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before captain miller were ready to repressurize the clark but justin the containment second containment we have a man down ill be all over it come on skipper i already put my shoes on from what cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission you can call him babybear he loves that time to play spam in the can smith clear that airlock man im coming in solid as a rock hey smith were still venting trace gasses gim me twenty minutes to plug the hole well have to reroute through the port conduit to the apu youre sucking too much nitrogen in your mix shit smith youre going biblical on me what you been out there a long time trying to break my record i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect im telling you i saw it you werent there i saw it it was like nothing was there and then justin appeared and the core became metal skipper do we get hazard pay for this coffee damn dr weir dont scare us like that coffee what im gon na activate the emergency beacon i dont want to go where the last crew went id rather be dead can you shut it down how the bridge is gone let me breathe let me breathe whats happening is that an offerit worked for weir prep the tanks you prep the gravity couches im going to manually arm those explosives on my way ill get him hold on coop coop where are you youve had plenty eva coop its justins turn stay on station if anything happens youre convinced the crew could still be alive after seven years everybody shut up let the man speak this is cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway okay listen up as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew dr weir this is starck navigation smith pilot justin ships engineer dont start with me cooper oh god oh god dj what do i how do i weir he used one of the explosives from the corridor dj the clarks gone smith and cooper are dead save yourself from hell what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed hear what its not a distress call its a warning go on what is it i i tried to go back for him to save him but i couldnt get to him in time the fire have you ever seen fire in zerogravity its like a liquid it slides over everything it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire and then he was gone i never told anyone until now but this ship knew dj it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick it knows our secrets it knows what were afraid of and now youre going to tell me its carbon dioxide of course not justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it just one of those things i swore id never lose another man i came close today real close well make it i dont need sleep dj i need answers goddammit dj it was not a hallucination i saw a man he was on fire and then he disappeared how is he no time we need whatevers left in our suits to repair the clark like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers and this is mission specialist dr william weir we all know where were going dr weir is going to tell us why hes a rescue technician peters medical technician dj justin i wont let you die youre not going to die not today i want you to do exactly as i say and im gon na get you out of there alright justin patch me through to him justin finish your sweep okay we do it the hard way deck by deck room by room starck deploy the umbilicus i believe youre up for a walk mr justin go get your bonnet on start the countdown thanks peters we need to know what happened to the crew before it happens to us thats a negative starck do it fine starck i want you to repeat the bioscan peters i want you to go through the ships log see if we cant find some answers you okay peters can anybody hear me hows the client justin check the containment for radiation leaks peters alive the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here what you got peters the blood came from somewhere peters starck you still showing those readings peters is right no ones here so where are they starck any luck with the bioscan ice crystals everywhere this place is a deep freeze clear and open on my mark three two one mark i am sorry but now we have to go to work i put in for a replacement for you but no one whats the hold up you cant have them go to hell starck cooper youre lying then what what are you tell me you want me to believe youre the devil well i dont thats bullshit what are you then who the fuck are you if you miss me youll blow out the hull youll die too what are you talking about your eyes son of a bitch just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or youll find yourself looking for a ride home watch me we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed fuck this ship its done maybe youre right but its still my command and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew and i think there is starck download all the files from the event horizons computers coop smith finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark to rescue the crew and salvage the ship the crew is dead dr weir this ship killed them and now its killing us were leaving thats exactly what we dont have doctor the other place what is that where has it been for the past seven years to what where did this ship go where did you send it you said this ship creates a gateway thats bullshit and you know it you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit i want to know what caused that noise i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock is that your expert opinion the only answer weve had out of you is i dont know do it were a long way from home and were in a bad place lets not make it worse if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time we dont get the power back our airs gon na go bad we barely have enough power for life support as it is if we cant stop the drain were not gon na make it what the hell is that dr weir explanation its 2041 what about it you have something dr weir your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart it may have killed one of my men no one goes near that thing i want this room sealed the second containment is off limits if it worked its insane how much time do you need we have seventeen hours and fortytwo minutes now what is in the core what could cause them whats in the core hold on whats this gravitational distortion one of my men is down i want to know what happened to him dr weirs right get on board the event horizon ill meet you at the airlock theyre empty dr weir moving forward negative easy peters were okay were okay lets finish the sweep i can see that whatre they for peters and i will search the forward decks justin take engineering no hotdogging not on this one alright once weve secured the ship thats the way it is i need you to guide us from the comm station this is where i need you help us to do our job once the ship is secured well bring you on board dr weir i need you on the bridge smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster what does it say where has it been for the last seven years until then do what youre told and stay out of my way doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no ones even told us why the clock is running dr weir if youll follow the rest of the crew theyll show you to the gravity tanks smith smith fuck get out of there now get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock one of the explosives is missing from the corridor i think weir may have put it on the clark smith get out of there what is it smith alright prep the clark for launch ill find her now what thank you get outside go back to work ill join you shortly thats enough we dont have time smith in twenty hours we run out of air im here smith hows the clark you heard me smith peters are you with me no ones dying on my watch smith what about the reserve tanks do we have enough time for a weld smith where the hell have you been starck give me a read put it through tacs smith you up for a flyby starck where is it i noticed starck anybody home dr weir i guess were about to find out keep us slow and steady what are you trying to say if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings were all on edge smith were a long way out bring us in tight starck get on the horn see if anyones listening make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees what is that i dont like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go is the course locked in hes dead repeat were armed were armed this fuckers ready to blow no ill be right back we blow the corridor use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship we stay put blow the fucker up weir activated the drive hes sending us to the other place whatever was on that bridge wasnt weir tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can im on my way starck stay here dont stop working what whats going on in there starck im going outside to work on the clark and starck dont tell anyone what you just told me weve got enough to worry about what i want is to survive the next ten hours if you knew it was impossible then whyd you waste my time starck do you know how crazy that sounds its impossible were hanging on by our fingernails and youre giving me bullshit stories to what what are you saying this ship is alive go ahead bioreadings of indeterminate origin dont you have anything useful to tell me what is it starck dr weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something no it was someone else do it dr weir not acceptable i want to know whats causing those readings if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found so where is the rest of the crew weve been over every inch of this ship and all weve found is blood dr weir any suggestions whats causing the readings what about the life readings you picked up we can take the filters from the clark carbon dioxide how much ohtwo do we have but you can breathe it okay lets find out how much time we just bought everybody okay keep your eyes open radiation interference come around to threethreefour then what are you doing here come on people lets go and cooper put some pants on starck why arent you on the bridge lets go justinroger that its holding shes holding what about the accumulator you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you it fell down you heard me this ship its crazy trying to go fastern light thats like the tower of babel id rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can this ship is bad it watches you where is it where is it no no we just got her back together come again skipper i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark skipper she was right behind me i turn around shes gone she could be anywhere captain we got a problem sir you break all the laws of physics you think there wont be a price you already killed the first crew understood ive found a six inch fracture in the outer hull we should be able to repair it and repressurize its gon na take some time captain miller you copy but theyre gone were losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone we are fucking dead we dont have time to fart we have a situation here captain miller it is now were locked in love to proximity warning 900 800 meters 700 were right on top of it were gon na hit 1500 meters were getting too close weve got some weather yes sir something like that yeah thats not it that ship was built to go faster than light thats just wrong it goes against everything we know we have a lock on the event horizons navigation beacon its in the upper ionosphere were in for some chop onefour degrees heading threethreefour jesus locked and cocked hey you dont need to be a scientist figure it out i didnt see anything and i dont have to see anything this ship is fucked what the safety circuits failed what the hell is that shit doc any closer and were gon na need a rubber jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker dead ahead 5000 meters hey i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship get them back explosive decompression range 500 meters and holding turbulence is dropping off 1000 meters range 3000 meters and closing matching speed now range to target ten thousand meters and closing skipper i got a bad feeling about this you cant do that 30 hours to neptune orbit i cant believe this i havent gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit why not mars cap mars has womenwhat you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion i dont know what happened to justin saw what mr cooper what did you really see because what youre describing is not physically possible no he didnt the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months it seems impossible but in light of the transmission i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now no thank you what thank you a written briefing cant possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this i have to go with them its the event horizon shes come back incredible these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared this this happened this isnt some kind of hoax you wanted to see me admiral thats the second containment seal beyond that engineering background radiation perfectly safe youve reached the first containment seal the engineering decks are on the other side i built it is zero thats what the singularity does it folds space so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time after the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal its called a gravity drive someone sent that message admiral you have to put me on that ship the crew could they still be alive this is not about my reputation this is not about me at all the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds seven years ago we didnt just lose the ship and the crew we lost the dream i have to go i designed the ships propulsion system i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive you cant send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed that would be like like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle this is weir nooo im not asking you to believe me youll see for yourself and so will your crew youre all coming with me there is no devil there is no god there is only nothing better if i just show you im not the devil you know your fear do you remember the goliath miller weir is dead what makes you think ill miss do you know what a singularity is miller does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is it is nothing absolute and eternal nothing and if god is everything then i have seen the devil its a liberating experience i dont need them anymore where were going we wont need eyes to see i told you she wont let you leave you cant leave she wont let you you you cant do that what about my ship dont dont do this youre insane youve lost your mind you cant your orders are specific i dont know i dont know theres a lot of things going on here that i dont understand truth takes time i dont know i dont know yes what do you want me to say thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations justin just tried to kill himself the man is clearly insane i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain check the core for radiation carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries the core i dont know intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time its possible black holes make sense on paper its all math you see but as to what really happened the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like lazarus returned from the dead exactly the ships internal clock is off by seven years the event horizons computer thinks its 2034 the date theres no danger the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields its under control if it worked yes insane the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star the event horizon could be there in a day its complicated its possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting spacetime they could be what hit the lewis and clark yes it beats dying mister smith no one any survivors captain miller the foredecks are just ahead in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat youre in the central corridor it connects the personnel areas to engineering that is not acceptable captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship be careful its not a load bearing structure thats the engineering containment and theres the main airlock we can dock there nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message thats what were here to find out it was the ships maiden voyage to test the drive the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters they received the goahead to activate the gravity drive and the ship vanished from all our scopes no radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind they disappeared without a trace until now ive been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space captain miller i appreciate this opportunity captain miller i just want to say isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge no i saw nothing can you see a body yes we can see some kind of mist what is that youre at the bridge ms peters you still havent seen any crew theyre explosive charges claire wasnt that ship destroyed hes been past mars yes thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support were losing atmosphere thats the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship foredecks crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area can we move in closer shes not ugly where is she say this paper represents spacetime and you want to get from point a here to point b here now whats the shortest distance between two points it means nothing the forward airlock im alright please it wants me i have to go no theres no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind its as if time just stopped for seven years yes i miss her she died two years now yes hmmm claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her i told her that wasnt true i just knew the event horizon better thats all thats how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black holes immense gravitational power to create the gateway thats how the event horizon travels faster than light what is it ships log could it be the crew if they were in suspended animation wouldnt that effect the scan do they have pressure wrong the shortest distance between two points well in laymans terms you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold spacetime consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity relativity yes we cant break the law of relativity but we can go around it the ship doesnt really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to another light years awayof course but theres more uh vip security arrangements generally take some time senator standing right here in my office your prerogative senator nothing i can do about it unless youre suggesting i infringe on their civil liberties which id happily do if youll just trim a little fat off the constitution senator they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses basically he asked me if i could unring a bell well if you had to go over my head lieutenant thats the way to do it christ nothin like a 0200 call from the commander and chief to get the bowels movin im not sure what i dont see how oneil dismissed i find this as distasteful as you lieutenant but if its on my desk its on my shoulders theres going to be an inquiry it will not be quick and it will definitely not be pretty you should prepare yourself i dont know of any delicate way to say this lieutenant so i wont try claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization of the samesex variety specifically that you were seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming permission to evaporate oneil well all have lunch good idea oh and lets be sure to invite this sociologist too just in case we want to have a fucking bridge game afterwards you makin friends with the press lieutenant youll get everything you want oneil lets see if you want what youre gon na get then good night and if you just happen to wash out i wont have to contend with you bitchin to some hairychested female senator and please note i did not identify any one in particular straight up well least now were talking the same language so one standard is that what youre after no sir what what i resent lieutenant is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men the daycare center i have to build where an officers lounge used to be and the obgyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears but most of all lieutenant i resent your perfume however subtle it may be competing with the aroma of my fine threedollarandfifty nine cent cigar which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities does it did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander if so i regard that as a bonafide brain fart and i resent it when people fart inside my home did you just have a brainfart because i was civil now youre complaining oh really all right lieutenant give me a name and specifics ill have the xo file an action first thing in the morning a name didnt take long if you were like everyone else lieutenant i suspect we wouldnt be making statements about not making statements would we take your leave then thats all i have to say dismissed im not out to change your sex lieutenant youll have separate beds separate heads if you have specific medical needs inform the infirmary if a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner please inform me immediately so i can deal with it immediately questions dont worry about it if its off your collar and out of your eyes thats all im going to ask so were still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this for integrating the specrecon training it may not always be smooth but were trying to make it as painless as possible for you would you care for a beverage tea yes of course please have a seat lieutenantyes jordan ill wait for you no matter how long look its not like youd be completely out of reach and maybe we could call in a few favors get you stationed at norfolk instead of coronado there are ways of dealing with these things i mean if people are so inclined id sure like to know who wickwire thomas dane second run at coronado and correct they had him stashed in the appropriation liaison office whatever that is what well pardon me if i do now who else who couldve leveraged a class officer like that cmon jordan keep your head in the game or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the navy john james urgayle the chief well before you crawl off to die jordan give me five minutes of good headwork someone screwed you over like this left unanswered charges hanging over your head and youre not gon na fight back cmon jordan do the headwork with me the chief or maybe even turrentine your co almost like

stuff about you you may be in a hostile camp i think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn that bad how hard they making it on you ive been trying you for five days dont they give you messages jordan sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth but im trying to be honest okay three years is a long time dont ask me to predict how ill feel then jordan because i dont know and either do you i dont feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life jordan maybe we should just let it happen ill try to keep the door open if you wash out i make it so that youre such a ballbreaker sometimes especially at night well guess i dont even need to be here so dump on me shes haze grey and underway well youre doin shithot at intel specrecon those guys are world class warriors and they will not want you there jordan so whyre you even considering it are you by the way ill need that option paper by 11hundred today so i can review it with admiral hanover and do we have any of that breakfast tea around here intel has its own glory lieutenant no matter how subtle probably hear back from cnn first that was good headwork lieutenant you expect the extraction team to ride the sub bareback is that correct oneil blank faces here oneil halfway round the world so thats the problem we can get the team in just not out youre the analyst for east china oneil analyze signals received only sparingly in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries got ta situation here where are you stuck in traffic i dont what someone on base a mole even tough i dont talk to her every day i still talk to her every day know what i mean christ i dont want to see her take a fall she thinks i do but i dont know seems women the

whos your partneri wont forget ill call her then say yes max i understand i mean it i dont care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries i dont know maybe its a language problem anita you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided ill never write you again you understand but then you told her you were home but you didnt ask permission you broke a trust if you had asked karen probably would have let you im sure she would tomorrow ill talk to your probation officer karens a good kid but shes mad at you because you lied to her this business about your grandmothers funeral i told jackie and jackie said you wanted him i found out i went to give him his refund so he wouldnt have to come here in his inside coat pocket im just tired in general thank you for saying that but no my business thanks but you have a good time madrid or barcelona wherere you going youll get over that im fiftyfiveyears old i cant blame anybody for anything i do i know i didnt say you did not after theyre dead thats ordells did you tell him you were leaving whats he doing im sure i hesitated taking that much less ten percent what if he hears something hes not supposed to we get ordell to come to my office nicolet is he already there or does he come busting in while were chatting what do you tell nicolet why tell him you want to see him set him up so how do we give ordell to nicolet its not that simple everybody wants him hes a homicide suspect it doesnt matter who brings him in hes gon na name you as an accessory on the phone i told him i have the ten thousand he put up for your bond i could bring the money and the papers for him to sign walk out and call the sheriffs department people talk to winston hes street same as them they trust him they get busted they know somebody who can bond them out i thought i might drop in on him hell no doubt be surprised to see me all winston had to do was ask around ordells living in long beach with a woman junkie in a dress youre gon na have surveillance all over you then youre out and you get nothing youre takin a helluva chance kid what if he checks it wheres the rest of it but you still have to show him the money at the airport itll be more than that you know a good cop wont let you know he knows youre fulla shit do you think they bought it youre rationalizing the feds its evidence dont even think about it you could get yourself killed go to prison i believe i said id be tempted which one more or less he never came home but im sitting on the couch in the dark holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew so after a couple hours i think what am i doing here nineteen years of this shit so i made up my mind thats it thats my job shoot him with the stun gun while hes incapacitated cuff him take em to county and went to this guys house in el monte and i waited for him got another gun and a stun gun uhhuh yeah that night i went to pick up a guy i hear hes staying at this house so i sneak in wait for him to come home hi im max cherry your bail bondsman its been a long time coming i finally made up my mind i guess it was thursday a lot of reasons but the main one would be im tired of it i have to stand behind all my active bonds but im not writing any new ones okay sure i might be tempted especially now since im getting out of the bail bonds business a halfamillion dollars will always be missed if i saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money would i take it what if i was in nicolets place no harm in that hes a young guy havin fun being a cop i know the type trust me on this hes more interested in ordell than the money if hes gon na do anything suspect itll be cutting corners to get the conviction but he wouldnt walk off with the money its evidence has nicolet told you any colorful stories like that you know some interesting people has he hinted around i see i dont follow your logic what does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting ordells money you think hes got a thing for you i called you last night he was here will ordell go for that sit down leave the bag under the table make the delivery somewhere in the mall you dont actually do it that way bring the money in and they follow it you talk them into it whatre you a bag lady i dont care im old enough to be her father shes adorable but i had to end it sandra bullock you know her for now these relationships never last too long well id never be so bold as to speak for all men but as or myself and a few of my friends thats definitely the case theres a lot of actresses out there you like and theres some you have crushes on but theres always one who you love and with her its sorta like going steady no i dont believe shes ever heard of me but that doesnt mean were not going steady pretty good me and annette bening are goin steady american president catching a movie i walked right past you well hello fifteen thousand does something else worry you bigger you know i cant really feel too sorry for you in that department im fine with it or i wouldnt of done it i did it to feel better about myself and i do when i look in the mirror it looks like me okay im a little sensitive about my hair it started falling out ten years ago so i did something about it its not really something i think about youre not old you look great its very possible ordells killed somebody youre gon na offer to set him up how do you get it out no thanks theres got ta be other ways to get it out why what whatd you do he called you howd you find that out well if the atf guy is the one who wants you thatll only interest him up to a point what i meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you are you its nice 76 who is this this is pretty you never got into the whole cd revolution it looks nice sure somebody loan it to you you went out this morning and bought a gun you went out this morning and bought a gun blacks fine you get a chance to use it if youre having some whatdya think give em what you got offer to help show a willingness to be helpful you want to stay out of jail dont you well jackie you got caught youre gon na have to give em something ask atf they might give you permission if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law why not pack a hundred grand cash poor hes got that kinda money how many trips did you make cause if he busted you youd play hell bonding out of federal court he doesnt want you mad at him he wants you to tell him what you know he uses you to get a line on ordell make a case then take him federal you know what ordells into hes the one who wants you no you didnt what branch you mentioned a guy from lapd but you didnt mention the federal same as you ten thousand i wrote him on monday they found him dead on tuesday that would be beaumont livingston what did they want to know they wanted you to tell them what you know you know who put the dope in your bag but they wont want to take you to trial theyll offer you simple possession a few months of county time and a year or two probation how bout another id say if youre tried and found guilty you wont get more than a year and a day thats state time prison what have they told you i am as a matter of fact you know i figured out the other day ive written something like fifteen thousand bonds since ive been in the business id say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related if you want i can help you look at your options was she helpful whats your brand ten pounds i lose it and put it back on great why does it need to be dark its kind of a sports bar we could stop at the hilton by the airport i thought you might want a drink its okay its a cop hangout sure ever been to the riverbottom in cash youre serious i gave you my card there who do you think i am i can give you a lift home if youd like i think i do is that good enough they dont have your winning personality youre right that was ordell you have time you think you could find out for me where hes staying whatever looks best and starts the soonest im going to del amo see a movie get something to eat im going out for a few hours yes no yeah uhhuh turn left its the next street she will shes all alone uhhuh if she wanted to set you up youd be in custody right now when you said youd name her as an accessory she believed you that scares her more than anything im telling you you got her spooked she wont leave there till you have your money and youre gone its in the safe she cant get at it she still is she doesnt want to get shot before she can tell you what happened she was afraid shes been there since thursday night my office this place stinks in a way yes all i did was walk out with it jackie didnt trust melanie shed already tried to get jackie to go in with her split the half million amongst themselves what she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money she wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent she also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it uhhuh thats what winston does he finds people who dont want to be found winston found you she wants to give you your money if she didnt thered be cops

these days and uh so lem me get this straight we got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets we got information no one else in the world is privy to and were in a 1986 ford ltd about to go look at an insect but not a bug bug its an insect its a bug i understand hey it works for the hasids right no one recognizes them oh right i guess thats kind of cool too in its own way course this isnt really black its kind of a dull dirty tarry sort of noncolor isnt it well how about if i guess then black vast space deep spiritual the essence of infinity kay seriously what if he actually means what he says sure you know theres something we never really thought of why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet is having then leave the

thousand pounds i think wed know if held left historys proven that where theres a nitrogenizer theres a 12legged signazoid they use it to make our food digestible for their systems or someone has a nitrogenizer well mr intuition when the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence what does that lead you to believe its an edna named after zeds ex wife all you do is at the target the scope matches the image with the image on your retina the barrel will find the target on its own lets check am out if it was just a meal why did they have so much luggage something seem unusual to you about that lets see that was second gearkay shifts into third jay winces you dont know me at all why it was a long time ago i taught kindergarten you dont know the half of it if you dont have anyone to tell you wont tell anyone believe me you get used to it just so i understand youre thing is acting like an idiot or is it actually being an idiot besides such a shame too cause you made such a good impression the first time she didnt even know you keep her out of here while i check it out this is a college im sorry i thought it was a carnival its the way we do it the way weve always done it so whats the problem right the point is to not call attention to ourselves we wear black lets go jeebs downtown and im bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me and im arranging deportation papers your licence is revoked permanently you figured what maybe you need a closer look what a coincidence cause i was just thinking about you too jack recognize this goodwill not bad briliiant actually you come unarmed and alone cause your armys been growing underground for what 100 years 150 no a person is smart people are dumb and the more people you put together the dumber they

kill her no matter what if i take him these jewels hes gon na kill me and her youve got to decide that for yourself you live with it and they haunt you it doesnt leave i look at it as how many ive saved thats the way youve got to look at it that it is maybe theres one thing you have to remember you dont create the situations you can only try to save people from them it might have happened no matter who was up there pull up alongside i dont know but ive got to get on there damnit hes cutting down the visibility see this solis has me driving the shitmobile and he picked this up straight out

combo does well we cant leave him out what do you think you know why i like the track because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better we had a plan but swat opened up too early he got caught in the crossfire lets move on notice this always use the eyes to keep the connection it almost like hypnosis thats the most important thing create a connection youre always on their side what did you see okay stop so why would you hesitate to lie to save lives why thou shall not kill youve killed right whats the first commandment you know the ten commandments get good at it if you want to be a successful negotiator youve got to learn to lie you could say something like tell me what the scumbags name is maybe we can work something out nah i just throw that in because i enjoy it then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit i need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so i can cut off his nuts itll come try again first things is dont say whats going on everybody knows whats going on i come into this situation i say im glad to see nobodys hurt thats good im here to help you second you hesitated dont hesitate if youre thinking talk while youre thinking or else hes going to think youre plotting which you are if he thinks youre plotting youre going to make him nervous you dont want him nervous got that you think you can learn mccall yeah you think so but it comes up lesson two dead eye should have been lesson one never exchange yourself for a hostage yeah well thats a sore subject and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage where did you hear that no actually i think its fucking crazy i dont know if i could do it thats a lot of commitment i admire that every couple of months huh oh city girl dont you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in new jersey she grow up in livingtston too explain how that works you living together you wouldnt want to put a small wager on this would you you got a girlfriend you have to its a tradition come on lets go for a drink not the ones im at how are we gon na get him out of there im not sure i grew up in oakland crossed the bay bridge and here i was so youre looking for fast advancement youre a real excitable sort arent you how did you like toronto youd never been out of new york you dont like new york with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers why here recruited you from where so mccall how come you ended up in san francisco i appreciate your concern lets leave it at that a little exercise in lateral thinking the obvious solution isnt always the only solution see you tomorrow try to remember that swat is a lifesaving unit you know it rarely has to be done how do you feel after a shooting you ever been in a hostage situation were already past it arent we kevin dont go reading my lips man thats an intrusion save that shit for the sniper school comprende youve

the coma i cant believe this why dont you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn animals that attacked my uncle yeah well these fleas must have teeth like fuckin chain saws what do you mean maniacs legume you mean a vegetable not too well he taught at the sorbonne right dad always calls him his hippie brother did some work with timothy leary i think and is he is he going to die jesus right listen my uncle its not serious is it did he eat some bad snails slip on the bidet what thats mcdermott but yeahall my life ive worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind well this is it this is power i told him it wasnt ready thats what serafine is searching for without much luck im afraid if only we could speak with him but alas hes off in another realm close to death yes that sociopath hes given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy to him adam is just a threat to the terror he holds over others to us its salvation yes i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications it took a lot of trial and error but finally he got it adenine dimethyloxide adm i call it adam but just before he was attacked he hid it its chemistry andy nothing more mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine like chain reaction in the infectee there were not many biochemists working in the twelfth century but with todays technology its possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to i dont believe weve been introduced simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed these pictures are not just myth andy the scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public this is the medieval version of a newspaper youre exactly right andy i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm and now im counting on your assistance too my god serafines right its time to go well talk soon you didnt know but then why did you well dont worry its relatively mild terrence and i came down here to do serious work for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate andy hes on a new drug called zbh or daydream it allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while hes dreaming he is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time you think its silly but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep the cops its their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception exploring new states of psychic awareness its horrible terrence was one of the most brilliant men ive known im sorry my friend im not signing books right now theres been a tragedy oh did i hurt the little girls feelings well excusez moi i confess my desire for adm is quite intense so i deceived you and our poor friend terry a competent technician but lets face it a bit naive the great cure for lycanthropy hmph he didnt have the vision to grasp the potential of adam until it was too late and even then he came rushing down to tell me as if i would be just as shocked ha no its no cure its something much more interesting god well dont let him go catch him serafine is that you whats going on allonothings happening why isnt it doing anything cure hahaha another step and hes dead do you think im an idiot whats the problem if you know about the church why ask such stupid questions the adm lets go and you call me a moron what you think claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance dont be an idiot im not the only one if i die serafine dies no but ill kill your fucking girlfriend saint severin the church so you know all about the adm where is it tell me tell me or else before the coma bullshit your uncle told you wheres the adm where did your uncle put it in paris we have an expression for people like you encul damericaineither way works for us oh sure it was all mean old marcels idea give me a break we didnt tell you because its a wild goose chase not to mention disgusting look merde i cant believe this tell you what well jump together also like sex with my wife just like sex with my wife are you crazy you know thats totally impractical besides like the bible says an eye for an eye merde just missed lets face it its a how do you say motherfucker but were all in it together thats why were trying to help you oh give me a break he could use pills back in america why not get a little culture hanging is nice never goes out of style what about harekare a taste of the orient but no youre in paris try the guillotine theres one in the louvre yeah well i dont know much about chemistry but even if this stuff works you better find it by midnight otherwise its dont worry in a few seconds you wont feel a thing but this is class kid all the way what a way to go good man now can i have my arms back no we cant thats the problem god knows it would beat hanging around with you what are you so damn angry about did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out huh im afraid shes not so lucky shes undead and so am i well when youre about to pop off what have you got to lose thanks for your help i dont know there were others much closer he was religious just the name of this hospital st severin he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness andy its not so easy there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris its a whole other city crawling with drug addicts lunatics skinheads its no mans land maybe we should go now you must be very tired well call if any new well heres what i think happened a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night why perhaps hes making a few francs on the side the psychedelic drug market is big these days he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and like they say if you lie with dogs you get fleas vegetable right my mistake it seems he was attacked by a maniac maybe two or three maniacs just after midnight yesterday they fled into the tunnels beneath paris thats all we know no the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time but basically he is how you say a legume how well did er do you know him hes in charge but uh between you and me my english is better this way so youre from new york eh i love those hill street blues andrew mcdairmo you think thats what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance saint severin right little twerp thinks hes colombo double merde merde okay so maybe you were right your uncle was carrying this the keys to his apartment are in there i talked to his assistant madame

kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external that its in respond to a private thought they just had they are just sort of realer and more alive and when you notice it so are you if you look at someone long enough you discover their humanity nothing i just watch till something strikes me do anything you think

daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case we have in fact weve been sitting here since the start of the millennium and id really like some action from you before the end of the world i said say that again son because the next time you do ill make sure youre in there with my daughter but in a slightly less healthy state and shes in a coma with a broken arm right now say that again son and i need fridays off to spend more time with my family speaking of which if youll excuse me ive got a lot of time to make up maybe two cars and a car very accommodating well no sir im sure im fired because i let a copy of a painting the get stolen certainly is quite right sir ahm yes sir yes sir congratulations marvellous thing bravo you have to sack me i understand sir ill go quietly in fact ill go right now exactly shes in a surprisingly terrible state isnt she bean the thing is sir ive just been giving the painting

have him with us the whole familys very excited ah he certainly has something sir yes this is doctor bean no perfect looking forward to it cut to on the other hand maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs yes great news fabulous triumphant course it might need a little smoothing over whens he due oh look i mean its kind of the last thing i mean id really like to but things at home are kind of sensitive so i couldnt really er ah jennifer i need you to watch kevin jen sure youre right jen you dont wan na talk about it honey calm down now its okay okay so the guys gon na look like meatloafs backside noones asking you to go to bed with him sean connery richard burton was very goodlooking what makes you say that theyre pretty learn it in the army you arrange those flowers

everything and take care huh i know its insane but im going to miss you how the hell should i know she was wearing a helmet it could have been worse jennifer this is not repeat not how we do things in this family ive told you never to get on one of those death traps please talk to me i promise to be reasonable well there is that he was incredible this guy is fearless he has no fear well michael boltons pretty grisly great goodgood point bernie precisely the kind of perceptive interjection id expect from my new vp how can we you ask survive without whistlers mother our single greatest asset well the truth is we cant so what am i saying will we find her again never this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius hes a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century thank you bernie well done now if youll excuse i have a little smartening up to do myself this is elmer our longest serving right got it what a pleasure governor reynolds id like you to meet some of our staff here well bravo what with you and whistlers ma i think ive got a winning team david so im wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel lord walton assures me this guys one of the very top scholars in the english art world has a couple of doctorates no less a car sounds sensible mmmmm of course i owe you a very serious apology young man it wouldnt surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this i sincerely hope that you do not of course not im sacking you for neglectful conduct relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred through your recent lack of professional judgement a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse david david david well congratulations isnt that great david bravo lets put on a good show tomorrow shall we dont want anything to go wrong i think youre wrong david she looks as fine as shes ever looked worth every cent of the 10 million dollars brilliant huh i already have a prospective buyer the current governor of california no less who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal spread the news i think decisive leadership has done the trick dont you no no no hold on we cant sustain our loses so ive decided to sell whistlers mother thank you david however flattery will get you nowhere truth is i have a rather different plan for whistlers dear mama bernie and i have been inspecting our books and the long and short of it is we can not survive with our current losses so time taken its toll on the old girl eh er pray tell me why sack him david what else can i do this business is not repeat not breaking even and david notice anything this morning glad to hear it tell poor mr larson to come through will you very pleased youve taken him in david at a time when noones job is safe it really identifies you as a team player ah david finally and this must be our professor from across the sea tomorrow you have a problem with that i thought perhaps as vicepresident and in view of the unfortunate attendances for the summer show this year the massive financial loss i am sorry you feel that way yes it is may i introduce you to bern why thank you sir

baby because he believed me walters was their fall guy blow up a building and blame a nut create fear dont you see your father wasnt trying to keep walters in prison he was looking into getting him out he didnt believe the official story he kept it in the side table in the front hallway he showed me i visited a few times then one of jonass guys visited when i arrived your dad was dying to jonas i didnt know that at the time didnt know who he was but i knew inside whoever he was hed send someone else so i started watching your father i wanted to keep him safe i dont know what it was all i know is i had a gun in my hand but when i saw you standing with him i couldnt do it if thats love its not so bad i found a part of myself that day i couldnt go back cant give you the details because i cant remember i went to court to kill him at the ezekiel walters hearing i was supposed to shoot him at the press conference you were there thats the first time i saw you yeah i know what its like no but they trained me to mk ultra excatcher america works get rid of the crazy people the lone gunmen and the system still works thats the last time you rode isnt it do you think it was your fault is that why where were you the day he died he gave it to me is that what they told you liza how do you really know theres gold in fort knox just because they say so we should go to tennessee and demand to see it come on reagan didnt die if he had died everybody would know what johnnys middle name was how come serial killers have two names but lone gunman assassins have three john wilkes booth mark david chapman lee harvey oswald connecticut after you its okay im the one who left it here this way not today theres a car following us probably another one flanking us the next street over it would

look great i thought you why love ruins everything doesnt it i would never hurt you liza think whatever you want but dont think that its geronimo love it lets you see things it gives you insight ive loved you since the first time i saw you yesterday you were wondering about the wall how it was possible youre wrong since i met you i dont dream about holes anymore yeah would you i mean could you love me then if i was normal maybe what if i reached a point where you didnt think i was crazy anymore if i was normal oh christ here it comes look i know you think im crazy i dont think i am but i know that im just im nervous i reached out and grabbed the first thing out there i know theyre song lyrics and i know how i feel i its like i resolve to call you up 1000 times a day to ask you if youll marry me in some oldfashioned way everything you do is magic i dont know what to say i love you you will they dont break in the summer do you know what building is right over this spot harriman tower their subbasement was flooded he didnt die in a pool call the coroner in rhode island ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated do you watch the news read the paper last week this whole place was underwater i see the big picture and you stumble around in the details right here in the 7th street subway station nobody dies in newport they couldnt even kill sunny von bulow there harriman drowned but it wasnt in newport right here in manhattan his obituary was in every paper but not one of them said he was murdered latest casualty ernest harriman you heard of him so now they feed us terrorists to create fear how much do you think an airport security system goes for then multiply it by every airport in the country there are all kinds of groups all kinds of initials but theyre all part of two warring factions one families that have held wealth for centuries they want one thing stability group two the boat rockers eisenhowers military industrial complex they want instability its a trillion dollar a year business when there isnt a hot war they make a cold one henry finch that they monitor everything that it was only a matter of time and now four people are dead maybe you better not try i worked so hard to keep quiet like a mouse i should have realized jesus its my fault they drew a black line over me and now im passing it on im passing it to you too you havent been bothering them have you i put an ad on a computer bulletin board i log on at the library so i cant be traced never mind youd think i was making it up did you see the van back there johnny dancer right you dont ride him anymore do you not since your dad died you run with your back to the picture like you were trying to get away once in awhile you sing along with music but mostly you punish yourself hes why you punish yourself howd he die is he dead is this your dad so whats the question i didnt mean for you to see it its like looking in someones diary and taking it out of context know what i mean shoot you gave me an hour now give me a day just a guy trying to put out a fire never but ive been practicing uh huh getting rid of my hub ive never read it i just every time i see one i buy it i dont know why exactly wan na hear my favorite part never heard of him who just five its the economy you think maybe one of them is not who they seem pretty scary huh absolutely not a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy if you can figure it out they screwed it up stone is their spokesman you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that theyd let him do it stones a disinformation flunky the face that hes alive says it all here it is conspiracy theory it just went out tuesday third issue this year i bet i struck a nerve pissed someone off ive been reading up on it if my universe had a hub you want something to drink the whole kit and caboodle of em are british intelligence agents spies jerry garcia had a double o rating just like james bond you know why the grateful dead are always on tour flesh wound no big deal you wouldnt be sitting here if you didnt halfway believe me so im a little jumpy who wouldnt be im not sure i think i figured something out it mustve been in my newsletter i have no idea well thats the eye right there money and all the power and misery it brings with it its a plot to take over the world the master conspiracy can take a lifetime to pull off and look here cease fire in chechenia thats good for the banks who lent the government money but bad for the guys selling them weapons listen to this some gas company in colorado their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive theyve accused the epa of quote turning a blind eye to the future more about life on mars from a rock they found on the south pole explain that one to me but maybe we should go to mars and find out how much do you think thats going to cost oh well maybe to the untrained eye hmm ahh ooooo yeah i think so six months eleven days nothing is easy i noticed yes people more serious about their work you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it crown victoria fbi car

through the sham the crazier i look to people like you cant you see thats what theyre counting on you want to go out sometime you think im crazy you going to warn him not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of hes cutting funding for nasa the milk cow of the aerospace industry were talking billions motive enough the presidents in europe tomorrow hell be in turkey right along this fault line they launched the space shuttle yesterday so why do you keep the picture up you wish you hadnt quit do you still ride not testing using nukes are passe this is the

leaning toward no im not a violent man mr lowry not by nature anyhow but if you hurt liza in any way ill kill you does that seem honorable youre here because you figured i might show up you should think of me as liza suttons guardian angel i like that a gun to your head and you ask about your partner hes okay may have a headache for a few days are you here with honorable intentions thank youliza sutton is dead you shouldnt watch jerry its a moment without hope weve arranged for you to take the blame everyone knows how youve been harassing the poor girl lysergic acid diethylamide with a little kicker of my own surely it must be coming back to you by now who have you been talking to jerry who else knows what you know im a very patient man yes you do jerry quite well i want this box rigged with a beacon in jerrys safety deposit box walters had nothing to do with your fathers murder i know the story a federal judge he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial you do recognize it then so youll believe what i tell you next because i need to find jerry and i dont think i can do that without you belief is immaterial whats important is the truth its been my job to find jerry im very much responsible for him jerry is dangerous jerry has killed yes thats right my dog one i intend to put to sleep extrapolate from there and what did i say it was it was me i was a minor missionary a heretic really but where else could a redblooded american boy lie cheat steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the allhighs besides now im trying to pay my penance as in resulting in death we pushed the envelope until it wasnt even an envelope anymore we experimented with hallucinogens we used electro shock to produce a vegetative state we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation i am impressed we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card mk ultra was terminated in 1973 but not the research it was renamed ex catcher a vulgar pop term but yes take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin that was our goal years ago i worked for the cia in the mk ultra program are you familiar with it what im about to tell you is partially documented the freedom of information act saw to that but much more of it isnt for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear im going to share secrets with you repeat any of it and youll simply bestow the title of paranoid upon yourself please sit if youre as impressed to see me as i am to see you youre very impressed indeed hows jerry feeling this morning reeducating trained killers in the ways of polite society making sure the men whove gone over the edge wont hurt anyone that sort of thing were very specialized only on the football field the truth shall make you free jerrys visits to your office why do you tolerate them why him a charming term now why him why you heres a fresh one why you your colleague mr wilson says jerry wont speak to anyone else that seems oddly possessive behavior to me and you have no idea where he lives so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president it was my dog let me ask you a question how long have you been acquainted with jerry you were going to ask about my nose the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today a dog bit italright you can see her but she cant see you i dont know we got someone watching her 24 hours a day she thats your option ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time in case you didnt know it youre crazy you made your decision yet well i dont know if it seemed like a possibility what about your intentions are they honorable thats ironic because were here to protect her from you im not sure what you mean youre welcome wheres my partner that you come with me dont go home and dont go to work either one could be bad no idea honest what are you going to do jonas builds assassins for a living several of whom may be in place already wed like to kill a few birds with one stone hes why i watch jerry jerrys the bait for jonas im it really doesnt matter think cia and exponentiate im a government employee and ive been watching jerry for awhile what gave me away you think we have time to fool around like this come on what do you mean yeah i do go ahead well be right down your call have a good night its his show for now look you want to get some dinner inter agency cooperation and all wasnt my idea youre welcome spooks so you want to compare notes on this guy thats the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan which way did he go guys a cia shrink here to id fletcher they knew each other somehow while we walk dc police want him for assault secret service for counterfeiting and were tracking him on a string of bank robberies no one knows what the cia wants him for were waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up this guy fletchers something else its extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at its a hoax i knew it hope theres a cartoon mike because of the earths rotation were only in line with vega so many hours a day the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations if dr arroway hadnt moved quickly we could have lost key elements michael kitz national security advisor so tell me still settling in really wheres dr arroway now i remember why i went into theoretical work kent for giving me a chance just for a moment to feel what it must be like to be you nothing i guess i just wanted to thank you ellie we both know that if i was any kind of a man i never wouldve entered this race that i would have told the president straight out helen eleanor arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass but shes got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together that more then anyone else on the planet shes earned this and that she should be the one to go because shes the best we have but thats not who i am i like to think its who i mightve been if things had gone a different way that i might have been worthy really worthy of what ive been given you do what you have to do and in the end as with everything it comes down to power and it isnt fair right well you arent staying they knew our level of development if as you say theyve done this many times theyd be well aware of the implications two years is still a hell of a long time and as far as we can tell there arent any provisions in the machine design for storing food water even air excuse me im late for a meeting as of three oclock this afternoon i submitted my resignation ellie you should know that im no longer the presidents science advisor i dont understand actually im running late ellie you were right ellie you were right all along weve cracked it lunacharsky found it interesting analogy and how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in africa its not a threat ellie its a fact if youre not careful you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly play ball really its good advice i want you to listen to me carefully the minute the implications of this message became clear this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one an extremely complex extremely volatile one there are forces at work here you dont understand i can help you up to a point but only up to a point ellie apparently hes genuinely interested in science this could be a chance to win him over the theological ramifications of all this are obvious the president feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them shes also named palmer joss as their liaison hes requested a meeting with you arrangements also have to be made for the vips coming in mostly religious leaders throw a gray scale on it standard interpolation you must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already if its attention you want id say youve got it just one thing why vega everyones looked at vega for years with no results and now yesterday they start broadcasting primes why it was a worthy experiment worthy of you i was wrong about that part but its over now then why havent you detected any signals if as you claim there have been thousands millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasnt one signal gotten through itll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through youre welcome to stay until then no youre not but the price has just gotten too high the point is this isnt just scientific inquiry anymore its turned into some kind of personal obsession meaning i have to go defend a budget to the president and to congress and youre out here listening to washing machines its not like youve given me much choice ellie i should have done this a long time ago certainly before i left the nsf but i wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt you know why im here ellie now exactly its complicated im surprised you even knew it was an election year very well since my appointment hes been made interim director peter sends his regards no thanks i disagree two theres nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and youd be wasting your time and only two probabilities one there is intelligent life in the universe but theyre so far away youll never contact it in your lifetime im not youre far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense im sorry miss arroway not only is it too speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation at this point in your career itd be tantamount to suicidecant doctors orders the low oxygenzero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive its all right i like it here ever try sex in zerog as each component was tested and shipped off to texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in hokkaido for backup purposes of course weve been right behind you the entire time you see my problem i couldnt appear to control too large a percentage my enemies wouldnt stand for it so i simply made sure the japanese consortium received the systems integration contract of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired whollyowned subsidiaries mmm look closer hokkaido island wouldnt you if you saw hitler on tv come i want to show you something i think whoever sent the message did it because theyre worried about us oh not quite yet at least for their sake i hope its not because theyre running out of time yes a shame still itd be worse if they died for nothing japanese squid fleet they use lights to attract them to the surface then turn them into sushi poor tired spinning girl how we feasted on her and now that weve had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap were pulling out thats paris where my daughter was born moscow where gangsters rule the night and i gave up smoking so many battles so many lives all that sturm and drang as if it never happened if it werent for a few power grids you wouldnt know we existed a sunrise and a sunset every forty five minutes thats my girl done in return you get the primer and with it the power to stay in the game do we have a deal that would seem to be the question of the hour i want to build it doctor of course im already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption but as i said my colorful past has made many of those channels difficult to navigate i need someone on the inside very good doctor ive also detected structural elements back references a general movement from the simple to the complex all of which would seem to indicate instructions an enormously complicated set of instructions for building something even if he doesnt receive the entire transmission heaven is the mustard seed not if you think like a vegan page after page of data over sixtythree thousand in all if im not mistaken and at the end of each thats my girl lights ive had a long time to make enemies dr arroway there are many governments business interests even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear and i will grant them their wish soon enough but before i do i wish to make a small contribution a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet whove given from whom ive taken so much oh maybe not out but definitely looking for you coat i understand youve had some difficulty locating the what are you calling it the primer that will make decryption possible ive found it the powers that be have been quite busy lately falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century if not the millennium perhaps youve noticed perhaps i could help deal you back in the infamous unfashionable bluntness youre here so we can do business i want to make a deal i find it convenient to keep my interests mobile anyway ive had my fill of life on the ground after spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer after outliving three wives and two children i find ive had quite enough of planet earth once upon a time i was a hell of an engineer please sit doctor i have guests so rarely its important to me they feel welcome in my home did you know this was once yeltsins flying dascha that dent is where he threw a bottle of vodka at the pilot at least thats what the people who sold me the plane saidmeaning does that mean you think it doesnt exist in other words maybe what you experienced cant be reduced to images on a videotape maybe they still plan to grant your request only in their own way in their own time or maybe its just like you said ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology ellie if you go out there like this if you admit to even the possibility that what you experienced didnt actually happen im afraid they really will crucify you please for your own sake for the sake of the world tell them what you know to be the truth tell them it really happened have you seen whats happening out there the terror the despair the world is on fire ellie people need something they can believe in something worthy and you can give it to them ellie the only one holding you to that standard is you the people want to hear your story they need to hear it ellie youre the proof you tell them your story ultimately theyll have no choice but to believe you it also makes god enormous i think of the scope of your universe ellie and it takes my breath away as it will everyone elses i do im not sure its come to that it was quite a page turner hi ellie there is no reason you have to be alone do you really think your life is meaningless eleanor is that why youre so quick to risk it because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose and then what then youll be safe im in love with you ellie what are my other options in fifty years never what are you so afraid of what ellie what is it what is it what maybe thats okay youre trembling during the crusades pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show theyd actually been there i thought it sort of made sense that earth is now your holy land so oh i brought you something so the final countdown ellie the last time we spoke i said some things what if their answer is oh thats easy a thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape our population out of control violent crime no food so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anitsocial the weak the sick the unwanted and ever since weve been doing great an excellent question doctor but what if we dont like the answer ellie what are you so afraid of ellie and yet youre willing to die for this cause the one thing thats given your life a sense of purpose dont you see the contradiction here do you really believe your life is meaningless i dont follow i dont consider you the enemy ellie im not out to get technology i only ask the question does it have to have all the answers i look out there and i see so much emptiness people are so starved for meaning and its something they just dont seem to be getting from science i wont deny i was ambitious when i had my experience i wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible im the first to admit that process included making some compromises you didnt answer my question whatd you think really youre willing to die for this and everybody you care about would be dead and buried if you came back youd only be four years older but over 50 years would have passed on earth relativity explain this to me one more time even if you traveled near the speed of light when you came back in other words god is one hell of an engineer why maybe youre creating a monster some of my best friends are scientists theyre saying the machine is alive some of my best friends are scientists prove it did you love him do you love your parents look im a reasonable person and reasonably intelligent but this experience went beyond both for the first time i had to consider the possibility that intellect as wonderful as it is is not the only way of comprehending the universe that it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with i had an experience of belonging of unconditional love and for the first time in my life i wasnt terrified and i wasnt alone its an old story i grew up in south boston more or less on the streets by the time i was thirteen id tried my first hit of heroin by fifteen id stopped using but i was dealing fulltime by the time i was nineteen i decided i didnt want to live any more at least not in a world like that one day i got on a bus i got as far as ohio before my money ran out and after that i just kept walking didnt eat didnt sleep just walked i ended up collapsing in a wheat field there was a storm i woke up and thats about as far as wordsll go now you know only a tiny bit even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt so if i let the pendulum go when it swings back you wouldnt flinch and you believe this law with all your heart and soul your faith tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger only smaller my fathers house has many mansions how do you mean spoken like a true believer and what would you have done if the odds had gone against you what im curious about are the wilderness years youre out there all alone no money mocked by the skeptics it must have taken tremendous faith make that two id have to say i dont know enough to have one yet for the moment i dont believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive i agree with mr rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here but i dont think it justifies taking an alarmist position dr arroway is right their chosen means of communication was a scientific one and a scientific approach is probably appropriate at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparentwhat pull the plug get her out of there ellie anything happening in there el what thats one way of putting it kitz the president the isc have shut down all official communications thereve also been reports of riots flaring up across the us and europe until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough especially for you what day its all right the important thing is youre safe thank god when we lost contact i thought we thought but youre okay were still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction did you notice anything at all that ellie are you okay like it or not its really happening its good to see you ellie ellie that is true but its also true that if i really thought we wanted the same things id follow you anywhere but the truth is i dont think you want the company be honest el theres nowhere youd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe and call me crazy but i just cant compete with that im sorry ellie im getting married her names laura she came up to owens valley to do her postdoc about six months after you left ellie jesus maybe thats the problem i want a family ellie i want kids a townhouse on l street instead of still living like a college kid a real life maybe that makes me a sellout but i dont care anymore its what i want the work jesus ellie cant there just once be more to life than the work okay maybe thats the only way to get the recognition win the prizes this is a chance to be of enormous help to other peoples research to have the power to be a real advocate where davids got blind spots im going on staff at the nsf to work for drumlin im moving to washington actually thirtyone linked dishes you could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here what if i said i could get drumlin to agree to sell you time in new mexico how close are you to getting this funding put together ellie even if you do manage to raise the money have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this i mean a college fetish is one thing but were talking about your career you wont be publishing you wont be taken seriously and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all and any luck on the grant money any sufficiently advanced technology they cant i think its against human nature to admit to that level of insignificance to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe keep it down okay drumlin thinks im enough of a flake as it is look everyone here has their little fetishes caven goes to topless bars vernons got his carnivorous plants mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence yavol peter valerian thats what they all say its beautiful but it does get a little lonely sometimes i think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isnt to avoid excess radio traffic but because were all such pathetic antisocial misfits speaking of which howre you getting on with the old manchildhood is over ellie its time to grow up its time to go home now ellie this is the way its been done for billions of years no more stalling captain that isnt the way it works eventually youll get here on your own this was just the first step in time youll take another if we dont engineer a consistent causality itll work itself out on its own and thats almost always worse ellie according to your physics none of this is possible a lot of it youre simply not capable of understanding not yet no offense now you go home you always have been were all descendants of the same stars ellie all made of the same primordial atoms am i one or many life is unspeakably rare so whenever we do find another civilization especially one thats struggling we send a message sometimes we can offer help sometimes we cant but we always try life is simply too precious not to you have your mothers hands there are no tests ellie we dont sit in judgment think of us more as librarians curators of the universes rarest and most valuable creation not all some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams some never make it this far we dont know whoever they were they were gone long before we ever got here oh we didnt build it the transit system has been in place for billions of years were just its caretakers many others you contacted us we were simply listening weve been listening for millions of years small moves captain small moves originally just another species like yourselves well not like you at all actually but we thought this might make things a little easier am i artifact or dream you might ask that about anything thats my scientist im sorry i

you know how it goes i got a few nite owl questionsyou have your extracurricular secrets i have mine well hold a clarification session soon for now i need your fearsome old habits at the victory motel were going to brace a man who may know who killed jack vincennes can i count on you imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated but dont stop there extrapolate imagine the police in control its big lad ive long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation that day will soon be here and youll share handsomely grand means will be in our hands wendell youre perplexing to me these days wendell youre not your old cruel self anymore i need proof that the extracurricular work i had planned for you remains within your grasp youve got it wendell how what wendell will you work for me i need you for an assignment the chiefs given me the goahead on a duty few men are fit for but you were born for youll be working out of homicide four of the defendants recanted their testimony theyre yours take them wendell i want you to come to work for me dont underestimate his skills as a politician he exceeds even myself but the department needs smart men like exley and direct men like yourself your partners through department scapegoat on the chiefs orders hes been billed hell be indicted and hell swing it wouldve happened years ago if you hadnt carried him why the loyalty wendell and for good reason judging from what i know of your background lad i admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner i admire you as a policeman particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job and i am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters do you hate them wendell call me dudley he made his play amd he got what he wanted theyre making him a detective say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables lad may i have a word with you and reciprocity mr hudgeons is the key to all relationships and alright well drop that line for now next topic please comment on pierce patchett but you were business associates its for your own safety now what can you tell us about sergeant john vincennes this is mr hudgeons wendell really would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorneys working hypothesis why not lad absolute justice absolutely prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes the heroin well run down to the coloreds anesthetize them as long as its not a middle class problem no one will care its still a crime free city for respectable people a vacuum edmund thats what we have in los angeles sending mickey cohen up created it my containment work maintained it certain photographs guarantee it organized crime has been held back but theres still a demand for the services it provides jack was a shame but dick stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin through his whore girl friend i sent him to make the buy the rest is history im loathe to kill my brother officers edmund anonymous probably nothing there always are but there are also three men and three guns matched forensically a few loose ends dont matter dont get sidetracked stay with the nite owl ed i want confessions get on it why its mine ill make you my second in command edmund you dont want it and you cant have it you should stay away from a man when his blood is up so be it youll reap the benefits but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department no edmund hes a man who can answer yes to those questions i ask you from time to time stenslands a disgrace straight d fitness reports from every co he ever served under but white is a valuable officer at least get rid of the glasses i cant think of one bureau man who wears them then for gods sake dont be a detective stick to assignments where you wont have to make those choices patrol internal affairs but not the bureau would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorneys working hypothesis yes or no edmund answer yes or no am i would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment youll make lieutenant inside a year patrol division that was his favorite toast i saw the test results on the lieutenants exam you placed first out of twentythree not even with exley have you discussed this with anyone else john dont start trying to do the right thing john you havent had enough practice youre narco lad not homicide and since when do you work with edmund whats this all about lad a disgrace as a policeman straight d fitness reports from every co he ever served under what about him lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the beach in santa barbara john vincennes its three am lad i think youll be surprised what edmunds capable of john i doubt youve ever drawn a stupid breath dont start nowyou know all i ever wanted was to measure up to my father you figured this was a setup and you showed up anyway me you called it i got a message that we should check the records and we should talk to lynn bud jack thought he was up to his neck in all this ellis loew patchetts dead he sent you after me id say dudleys tying up his loose ends we had one thing figured wrong i dont think dudley workd for patchett its a suicide note says he killed jack because jack had figured out a pornography scam patchett was running you expecting problems lets go see pierce patchett run a goodcopbadcop with a wrecking ball you want to help me swing it stay smart bud we build a case we play by the rules what pierce patchett figures in too thats the angle jack was working dudley must work for patchett its dudley for the nite owl they didnt find the shotguns they planted them the first guys to the car when jack and i got there were bruening and carlisle it wasnt the negroes the griffith park report was a phony and who says the purple merc was spotted outside the nite owl the nite owl stensland was going there to sell the heroin stensland and buzz meeks twoman triggers knocking off mickey cohen lieutenants when they killed deuce perkins they got heroin as a bonus stensland and meeks what were they up to she told you why you dont know what the word means you dumb bastard hows it going to look on your report a naked guy with a gun you expect anyone to believe that officer white put down that weapon and someone held up a coffee shop panicked and killed six people hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence its a surprise you like surprises dont you white jack vincennes hes the technical advisor on badge of honor sir he lives for it thats the way to get him i know that sir i also know that when he made lieutenant it was as a detective ill testify sir im not afraid to do whats right the public demands justice sir this was a fullfledged riot of policemen shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured force them to retire but someone has to swing indict try and convict stensland and bud white secure them jail time feed them to the sharks sir protect yourself protect the department just show me where they are where are the police academy files so on active duty meeks didnt make an arrest from 1938 to 43 anything until he gunned down six people clean where do they get

its a blind alley thats the last you know their workforce twothirds at least fall into the category well be closing down their operation for days at least go with a fingertip sample or urine none of the id photos match the enhancement it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers youve seen their security system they know who works there even if you ignore the mans expiration date his profile suggests that he doesnt have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals its still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor delivery manit could have blown in through an open window no but one or two borrowed ladders have shown up there in the past the skin flake was found in michaels restaurant the employees are all accounted for were already getting complaints about frivolous search with respect sir many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes maybe hes just unlucky is there something more we should know about this suspect sir i mean besides whats on his sheet this iisi the most likely location what a pity ill run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections of course that doesnt jibe with what we found this was an angry killing even if this vincent luca iisi alive is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death according to this hes a sick man congenital heart condition who knows how long the specimen has been here but theres an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes with respect sirit may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests i look around i see a lot of dry eyes the director was not universally loved he was leading the cutbacks in the program youre looking at a room full of motives of course sir were checking the entry log alibis grudges i dont understand why you were dragged out here sir its hardly worth wasting your timea nonothing case like thisyou have more in common than you

these people oh for gods sake will shall we start the uh that edge that whats that i happen to know so that would be a monumental waste of time wouldnt it will okay how this rectangle is subdivided

therapist his name is henry lipkin and hes a friend of mine hes also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field im sure itll be better than spending the next six months in jail thats right that you meet with me twice a week yes under two conditions ive spoken with the judge and hes agreed to release you under my supervision hello gerald lambeau mit well ill be speaking to your supervisor whats your name dont you walk away from me this is peoples work you cant graffiti here whatre you doing find out what its saturday yes i did how about gerald

so i hear youre taking some time sean hello sean youre wrong sean im where i am today because i was pushed and because i learned to push myself he wont be a failure thats right you were smarter than us then and youre smarter than us now so dont blame me for how your life turned out its not my fault is that what this is about sean the fields medal do you want me to go home and get it for you then will you let the boy yes you do youre angry at me for doing what you could have done ask yourself if you want will to feel that way for the rest of his life to feel like a failure yes you are sean you resent me and im not going to apologize for any success that ive had now dont do that dont you do that dont infect him with the idea that its okay to quit that its okay to be a failure because its not okay if youre angry at me for being successful for being what you could have been oh thats nice oh come on sean he can handle the work he can handle the pressure and hes obviously handled you what problems does he have sean that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility and you dont understand that hes at a fragile point look sean i dont care if you have a rapport with the boy i dont care if you have a few laughs even at my expense but dont you dare undermine what im trying to do here ready to falsify documents because youve given him license to walk away from this and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake and confuse him this is a disaster i brought you in here to help me with this boy not to run him out thats a wonderful theory sean it worked wonders for you look you took one road and i took another thats fine no no you hear me out sean this young man is a true prodigy sean this is important and its above personal rivalry look i dont know what else i can say im not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boys life but its important to start early i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twentythree years to do something worthy of a fields medal well youre the only one you see sean thats exactly not the point no one remembers that they who sean i really dont think you understand cutting edge mathematics think tanks the kind of place where a mind like wills is given free reign well have you talked to him at all about his future seems like its going well you moved youre here quite a bit then not at all oh what is this some kind of staring contest between two kids from the old neighborhood why would he do that what do you mean he didnt talk you sat there for an hour tom its a poker game with this young man dont let him see what youve got any vulnerability he senses hell exploit its on the college that would be fine just meet with the boy once a week five youre from the same neighborhood south boston i need someone with your kind of background they worked together for the remainder of their lives producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done ramanujans genius was unparalleled sean this boy is like that but hes very defensive and i need someone who can get through to him thats right sean he mailed it to a professor at cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought ramanujan to england he was alive over a hundred years ago he was indian dots not feathers this kids special sean ive never seen anything like him im sorry that damn conference you were missed how long has it been since weve seen each other i didnt see

of pity case you with your sycophant students following you around and you goddamn medal i dont have any anger at you im not angry at you and who do you think hes handling he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him and for 20 years hes been alone because of that and if you try to push him into this its going to be the same thing all over again and im not going to let that happen to him and why does he hang out with his friends because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to its called loyalty why is he hiding why is he a janitor why doesnt he trust anybody because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most why do you think he does that gerry he is at a fragile point hes got problems undermine i know what im doing and i know why im here hold on gerry now wait a minute is it gerry cause i dont think its fine with you give him time to figure

you about women im sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites and maybe youve been laid a few times too but you couldnt tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and nonfictional material but youve never been in one youve never held your best friends head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath looking to you for help and if i asked you about love id get a sonnet but youve never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable known that someone could kill you with a look that someone could rescue you from grief that god had put an angel on earth just for you and you wouldnt know how it felt to be her angel to have the love be there for her forever through anything through cancer you wouldnt know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term visiting hours didnt apply to you and you wouldnt know about real loss because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself and youve never dared to love anything that much i look at you and i dont see

i was on this plane once and im sittin there and the captain comes on and is like well be cruising at 35000 feet and does his thing then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off then he says man all i want right now is a blowjob and a cup of coffee so the stewardess goes runnin up towards the cockpit to tell him the mikes still on and this guy in the back of the plane goes dont forget the coffee no why thank you no so whats with this place you have a swan fetish is this something youd like to talk about times up thats it isnt it you married the wrong woman she leave you was she bangin

im in california cause you asked me to come but you dont really want me there and im stuck in california with someone who really doesnt want me there and just wishes they had a takeback and youre sure about that yeah but how do you know how do you know that what no when it came to stuff like that i could always just play not a lick i look at a piano and i see black and white keys three pedals and a box of wood beethoven mozart they looked at it and it just made sense to them they saw a piano and they could play i couldnt paint you a picture i probably cant hit the ball out of fenway park and i cant play the piano well all right beethoven he looked at a piano and saw music the fuckin guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy they had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldnt hear the crowd going crazy behind him stone deaf he saw all of that music in his head im trying to explain it to you so you play the piano when you look at the keys you see music you see mozart do you play the piano like me i guess so some a little i guess i dont know how do you remember your phone number instead youre going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke skylar no so i can be a doctor youre rich what do you have to worry about why is it important to you if i inherited all that money the only thing important to me would be workin on my swing cmon give me a peek and well go

at the bar the caramel thing is my pickup line i was trying to be smooth but at twelvefifteen i was gon na come over there and talk to you five minutes when you think about it its just as arbitrary as drinking coffee great or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels i didnt mean you listen maybe i kind of got that impression im will whattake a deep breath and realize that this is me breathing okay repeat this after me what else say more go to your reunion martin see those people and discover what they mean to you try not to kill anybody for a few days see how you feel what stuff maybe some of the discomfort youre feeling is guilt remorse over the innocent people youve killed and how have you been feeling about your work lately yes i think what you fear martin is domesticity its the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture its centuries old like king phillip in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought well wouldnt it be great if we hit the road and fought oh the saracens so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families you know where i live you neednt be so frank with me about your work say more how do you know tell me about your vision of the reunion weve spent a lot of time discussing those years remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared to the thought of the thing thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite you went to school with these people why dont you want to go to your high school reunionexcellent here they come how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece dont listen to him hes a professional yeah after i shoot you through the fucking forehead im gon na fuck you in the bullethole fine but were not going to let you do your job because were gon na do it and then after we do your job were gon na do another little job but since were both here i think its time to take a fresh look at our relationship i told them to kill you and they didnt a little misunderstanding among my associates come on live a little im sorry about the incident yesterday i want two eggs poached hash brown welldone english muffin for the bread and a coffee im gon na get you kid its a freemarket evolution youll wake up to it cmon kid we used to run together when you were a rookie i dont want to run against you this things real everybodys in we could be working together making big money killing important people im willing to let you in on the ground floor like a club work less make more im setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our effortsgood for a second there i thought we were in trouble did you see blank in there if he does our job hes our job i love i kill youre wrong look at his face hes falling for her look at him yup look you want to kill a good guy but not be a bad guy you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy and then you come in and kill the bad guy and then youre the good guy do his job im not a coldblooded killer we cant do our job unless he does his job it was the plo yes and the munich olympics in 72 a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened well remember when frysals men paid off the deejay in cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the well heres the news he hasnt been in portugal since 90 i know that from the file why dont you read the file man lisbon you always say that you always say that im telling you you never met the mansometimes we sell them to mcdonalds and just change them to special barbecue sauce you know those horsey biscuit gravy packets i move all of those i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland

yourself bob what do you want to do you couldve been a contender huh really fine bob how are you okay see you later its me martin blank bob and these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven so you eat read it everyday oh i see you got your individual slices of hope dignity confidence selflove justice and harmony i have no illusions about the future what is is we make choices and we become the sum total of our choices i can live with that you dont understand what if i come back will you come with me i was leaving a sociopath kills for no reason i kill for money like that theres a point an organic connection between all living things then i started losing my taste for it which usually means your time is up but then i realized it was something entirely different i started getting the sneaking dark suspicion that maybe there was meaning to life i was but no yes i was before but now im not its irrelevant really the idea of governments nations its mostly a public relations theory at this point anyway but ill tell you something until about five months ago i really enjoyed my work seriously when i left i joined the army and took the service exam they found my psych results fit a certain profile a certain moral flexibility would be the best way to describe it i was loaned out to a cia sponsored program its called mechanical operations we sort of found each other about five years now its something i do no yes could be the physical substance of love too junkykitschy deeper deeper even though i left you never left me not just memory but a substance in my blood okay then clearly candied diller wow i have to give this some thought shes not dead okay would you rather commit yourself sexually to a fourbynine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a supermodel for a month or make love to a otter on crank for a week yes actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue debis a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna shoulda brought my gun right do you want to get a drink first ill just help myself to a cocktail you look beautiful as long as i get the laugh dont rush to judgement until all the facts are in this night this reunion will be an important step in our relationship yes seven it is yes i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven oclock thatd be good whats that bad television bad people bad experiences well theres not much to tell its always the little things thats part of it are you going to the reunion you see someone and i guess sure seeing you would be part of that whole equation i suppose the most important thing really i dont know anyway this whole things my therapists idea its my shrink really i dont know exactly i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization i thought you know maybe seeing you some friends my house of course now a 711 where have i been well i got ta go but ill come back im a professional killer not much else im in california most of the time traveling a lot on business thats about it really here is now there there is here ten years i think what i miss how long has it been its nice to see you again this is me breating i am at home with the me i am rooted in me who is on this adventure out loud saw my mom im with debi and im on my way to the reunion if i get antsy ill kill a few small animals morality if i show up at your door chances are you did something to bring me there i dont care about that stuff anyway anyway that never use to happen i was always the prodigy now im just one of the guys uneasy dispassionate bored its just getting hard to go to work in a good mood im starting to think ive been in the business too long last week i did a guy younger than me mmm so youre saying that ulysses everything he said to his queen when he came backeverything was a lie he just wanted to fuck around were both professionals oatman why not i trust you you couldnt turn me in because of doctorpatient privilege and i dont want to be withholding and i know where you live theyll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do what am i going to say i killed the president of paraguay with a fork i just know shouldnt you be taking notes come on its in michigan honestly what do i have in common with those people or with anyone up on the right okay sometimes i am sometimes its only natural no you understand the psychology of the job i work alone effective but to tell you the truth ive lost my passion for work there you go i left it blank okay i know what i do isnt moral per se but if you could just look past that youd see a man worth loving its okay its martin the door begins to open revealing debi and newberry nice talk sugarmouth is that right no deal i didnt get into this business to have associates and i dont want to join your goddamned union loner loner gunman get it on my own thats the whole point why dont you become a cop or something you can drink coffee in the morning with friends hard to get good help these days no harm no foul wholegrain pancakes and an egg white omelette not me so dont paw at me with your dirty little guild and you could be sort of like a father figure to me thank you no like a union what do you want i guess have you seen debi newberry well i have to take this over to debi those all seem kind of related that sounds pretty interesting hey bob not bad you hey ken how have you been okay call them fine oh and if you could find out why they double booked the job and who is trying to kill me and call me back thats be great tell them my house exploded yes its the same as usual nothing remarkable about it at all ive looked at it its fine ill do it tomorrow see

heart to call me philip that i will indeed im afraid shes something of a gossip isnt she ouch now you are being rude you werent you actually for some reason you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself if thats a potential you see yourself fulfilling i mean my i sound a bit selfrealization ministering to help people reach their fullest potential would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and selfrealization you ask what the point is and god the angry parent and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self in many ways the churchbound tradition of the father son and holy ghost is simply a version of the parentchildadult triad within us all its a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology forget how to ride a bike they say you never forget well i of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion at times its the disorganization thats liberating and of course ive begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments in small groups and one on one couples its been a tremendously transformative year maybe a little controversial of course but were breaking down the old unitarian barriers no need to make excuses reverend edwards philip edwards you came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last

to transport it seven thousand miles would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member had to to keep him still for the trip i hadnt planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk but i only thought of adults it never occurred to me you are a billion dollar idea my little f youre kidding yourself an adult trex cares about one thing filling its own belly it acts the way people wish they could thats why everyones fascinated by it if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only ninetynine percent would killing lessons heartwarming you rally think thisll draw the parent why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill how close do you have to be what kind of gun is that where do you think youre going okay you heard his dieter find a new spot and remember were after herbivores only no unnecessary risks what why piss ingen is my livelihood dr malcolm and i will jealously defend its interests people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries you version of it if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy i hardly see how i am to you signed a nondisclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw you violated that agreement so you two were just uh telling old campfire stories were you i lost everything i came after on this trip but one trex in one theme park could singlehandedly bail ingen out of chapter 11 you know how to work a radio dont you dont ask me the guys completely out to lunch their what trespassing sabotage you could go to jail just for being here did you know thatbecause i didnt know i dont have the faintest idea what theyre doing here is there an antidote is there anything weve forgotten anything at all you think im all talk eddie you are an academic minimal is too much it has to be light it has to be strong any damage im not going john john so what are you out of your mind i still have nightmares my reputations a joke my leg is shot you think i need more of that no no no no no no i dont believe you what are you talking about what they do have motives why did you want to see me your message said it was urgent i didnt know you werent well resentful come on im fine im fine are you all right anything broken exactly what john hammond wanted us to do where does it say that how could you possibly this is nothing like austin forget about it out of the question youd miss the gymnastics trials youve been training for that for a year that richard well is he you know at the bus stop with the hair is that kid still bothering you very hurtful your mother tell you to say that ill make it up to you this summer i promise i cant tell you but ill be back within a week well i do and shes fantastic shell take you to the museum maybe to a movie if you play your cards right youre going to have a fantastic time okay karen is expecting you in half an hour you only have to stay with her one night shell put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there kelly what are you doing here whats he got in there it was a payoff and an insult ingen never there are no versions of the truth this isnt a corporate maneuver its my life i didnt tell anything i told the truth you cost me my livelihood that on which i relied to support my children do me a favor dont pretend for a second that you and i dont know the truth you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want but i was there somethings wrong damn it be sure i have to find kelly for sixty seconds maybe look at this you could this is singlewall construction its just a shack we cant stay in here wheres kelly i dont know no no what do you think they want so do it a favor and put it out of its misery dr juttson please take kelly back to camp right away leave the other car for us and well meet you there in an hour or so our chance to do what you cant stay kelly thats it its too dangerous no way shes nuts you gentlemen feel you have to do this now four counting the one in the chamber its called selftesting but in your case it sounds more like selfdestruction a uniquely human characteristic in fact human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think thats our function maybe every few sons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to his next phase maybe death and destruction are our job maybe were supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that but why i dont care about my life but if id ever thought for a second that she would be in danger yes and people will live in the absence of truth because it exists so that others would know about this place just flawed very deeply flawed a statistical phenomenon says everything in the world goes in streaks its real you see it everywhere in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets once things go bad they tend to stay bad bad things cluster they go to hell together you ever heard of gamblers ruin wed never make it past the raptors trust me i have some experience in this matter no im quite certain you cant birdshit what maybe maybe not theyre pushing us over the cliff oh god then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back ill call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now this expedition is over all right im satisfied with the evidence we have right

john hammond no were an independently funded expedition im her father youre going home im sending a radio call for the boats well all go down to the lagoon and wait for them you know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation but you didnt bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in you dont have the faintest idea whats going on on this island thats a scientific impossibility you know heisenberg uncertainty principle whatever you study you also changeare you looking for a problem you got ta be kidding you dragged me out of greenpeace to be a corporate stooge you couldnt get anybody else is that who were really working for gene splicers humidity i know highest lead density on the market oh look sarah i think shes with sarah head for the roof itll hold were sure as hell not going back out there shes with sarah come on what are they lava no way what do they want no get in the car before they hear us it has a broken leg there no reason for name calling i dont know these guys but i know em ive seen em on japanese whalers french barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the north atlantic theyre all the same they spray us with water cannon when we try to stop em sink our boats and then call us crazy then this is our chance do you see any family resemblance here oh my god shes gutty wheres kelly jump theres uh theres an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on whether or not you feel lucky one no from anybody in the group and you turn around right there no question asked nobody embarrassed well do we go on immediately im trying give it more morphine that little black line ruining everything thats what theyre doing you could choke on the diesel smoke already the kid scores with cheap sentiment oh no he doesnt need a friend he needs a shrink oh please how am i supposed to keep a straight face when johnny cash here tells me im going to skull island hey i wouldnt want to spook the woolly mammoths women bout eighty percent female in greenpeace i was a cameraman for nightline for six years been freelance since 91 do a lot of work for greenpeaceyou hear something if the nest is upwind so are we when he comes back hell know were here before we have a chance the truck it certainly does ajay go on up to my ranch take a look around the trophy room and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me sorry we were saying a true hunter doesnt mind if the animal wins if it escapes but there werent enough escapes from you and me ajay ive decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death maybe i just feel too close to it my just a little bit too much i think well im a very wellfunded old son of a bitch you go last time i plugged it in i suppose why that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas you actually wear it im touched sit down sit down what brings you to mombassa let it go peter the animal won its just fed it wont attack unless its threatened dont move we took to the rock possible good wheres the power and radio setup piss what is isnt it obvious youve broken its leg what rex wont be any different itll come i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep all the jeep had done was startle the bulls calves i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles all the way back to its den just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill forty yards less maybe i assume itll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down my fathers 600 nitro express made in 1904 karimojo bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant 8700 foot pound striking force to collect my fee good lad peter if you want me to run your little camping trip there are two conditions first im in charge and when im not around dieter is your job is to sign the checks tell us were doing a good job and open your case of scotch when we have a good day second condition my fee you can keep it all i want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs a male buck only why and how are my business if you dont like either of those conditions youre on your own go ahead and set up your camp right here or in a swamp or in the middle of a rex nest for all i care but ive been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas okay carnivores hunt near stream beds do you want to set up base camp or an allyoucaneat people bar cancel that dieter nows the perfect time the animal just fed so it wont stalk us for food predators dont hurt when theyre not hungry dont let it out of your hands again can the kid walk how many rounds did you find for that weapon you remember that guy about twenty years ago i forget his name but he climbed everest without any oxygen came down almost dead and they asked him why did you go up there to die and he said i didnt i went up there to live somewhere on this island there exits the greatest predator that ever lived and the second greatest predator must take him down so the truth is more important to you than your life itll still exit if they go on not knowing wont it why should they why did you come here feeling a bit blue are we whats that look we have two choices we can hike back down to the lagoon where we can sit for two days in the open next to a heavily used water source while were waiting for your boat to arrive or we can head for the village where we might find some shelter and we can call for help runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait can the kid walk you go if you like but were not waiting for you move it out if we cant stay in the rexs territory we have to move tonight none of that matters our communications equipments been destroyed if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff and im guessing by the look on his face i know no cried cow tell me mama my storygoodbye kundun hmmm i will buy them for you where will you keep them i do beautiful horses thank you holiness i do now are you of whom no not the way to talk to people i am sorry lhamowe are now accused of aiding the rebels the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt i will alert the chinese delegation you know i would never have let you go alone kundun the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home they will take lhasa next nonviolence means cooperation when it is possible resistance when it is not the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham it has been destroyed women and children trying to escape from the fighting have been shot with machine guns fired from airplanes land reform is underway in amdo the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed landlords are being punished the khambas gun is his most prized possession i admire them so they face a modern well equipped army and still they fight did you ever doubt it shall we consult the protective deities holiness the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war it is unlikely america perhaps there is great anticommunist feeling in america your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa in the americas one country did sponsor the resolution a land called el salvador the radio contact said one officer had died then he said the chinese soldiers they are coming and then the radio went dead eight thousand five hundred soldiers and officers we have recently requested mortars antiaircraft guns and ammunition from india we have several hundred in the area quite simple yes good america we shall see britain chooses not to india is a newly independent nation they are struggling india is in no position to help us yes as a free country but our attempts have proven futile we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese the war is over this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves ask whatever you will you are the man who wrote this letter you are the man who has come back to lead us you will soon have great responsibilities you must know what to do i am sorry for you to have to witness this kundun when it is time he warned about the future of tibet i do not know holiness it is an island american territory in the pacific ocean no this war is almost over no not very big roughly five thousand men may i listen to the news with you holinesswhat does the butter spot feel like true is that a true story or pretend does he have the spotyou have grown up very good we have had fun you and i fun for a little boy in an old palace you must study very hard do not neglect the holy things during this time the people will cry when they learn you are gone but they would all want you safe no holiness oh but you do kundun who else would be here these are dangerous times they want the dalai lama to lead them the people want you made dalai lama reting rinpoche has been arrested he tried to overthrow regent taktra today he is brought back to lhasa by government officials the monks at sera monastery have been on his side now there is trouble between them and the army ahh ahh yes we have enemies i would not know maybe but you are not a shepherd you are the dalai lama you can not you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony as you say it is a story you decide she carried a basket in her arms a big heavy basket and the old monk cautiously approached she opened her basket and showed what she had heads human heads only the heads things change kundun i have smarter men i am braveri worry about them your people are very brave they are fighting the chinese no one can stop them not even me where are you from all quiet yes i am ready a moment no can i free the prisoners here well collect them will you buy the sheep for me and you have horses you love horses but i am in charge can i do anything i want it is alright father soon i have thank you please sit general chiang if i were to go into exile could we expect any serious assistance from india suppose then we shall meet yes yes but they say he did time to study he is a capable man i want at all costs to avoid this do we have news from the delegation in china with much bloodshed so we must face china and all her might alone and the united nations surely all did you receive the letter the sera monks have surrendered i need to squeeze this brain the causes of suffering arise from true sources attachment desire envy hatred greed unkindness wrong view and so forth these are some causes of suffering true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions birth illness grief old age poverty pain death these are surferings the four noble truths as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering the truth of the cessation of suffering the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering i am him do you have money do i have money can i save the sheep from going to the market so they dont die arrange for me to speak to the peoples leaders i will not go the people will not allow it the pursuit of nonviolence very difficult i have always asked for plain information just the truth a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese i ask them to stop to lay down their guns i had relinquished doubt my first and foremost duty is to protect my people i feel sure of this and things change maybe not right away maybe not soon but i believe this things will change i am scared tibet at war no china is close america is far away after countless people die china would still always be close we will work with what we have at this point the most likely result of a foreign pact is war and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking agreed send ngabo is that all where is that has anyone died what is the size of our army now i shall send a letter to america to the president informing him of our problem ask the chinese mission to leave our country immediately and america britain can india help us so tibet too needs to define itself what is the danger from the chinese now i need to know what you know i am no longer a child what can i do i am only a boy look here tell me what was the warning of the thirteenth dalai lama where is alsace will we ever be in war will we be in this war the regent is adding men and he bought rifles and ammunition from india mountain guns too is that big how big is tibets army please always i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments industrial progress great efficiency your people are capable and courteous i leave tomorrow for me i think such a mix is crucial i am happy to hear you say this chairman mao i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay i have great hopes for the future of our cooperation do you think i must you will always but you will always be here he was always nice to me he found me he saw me in his dreams is he a bad man norbu says he is lavish and willful how can he give you monks vows if he has not kept them himself soft nice i have a good friend back in lhasa you decide what do you think he does a little spot where the butter had been this little brother was terribly sweet when he died my mother was so sad a lama said to her before the little brother was laid out for burial take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin he will come back to you you will see so my mother did this and a few years later a new boy was born and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder we have i will miss you am i running away you will not come but i have no experience then i am lucky i am still too young why is this what is happening tell me this is tibet and this is china where is poland this is britain but surely we are safe in tibet we dont believe in killing the chinese maybe in the next life the world will not need a dalai lama i want to be a shepherd taking those goats and cows out to the hillside i want to run down the street i want to buy a toy eat from the shops i want to go down there pretend is that true or pretend why is your beard so funny let me touch this i have more men and after the game were going to trade you just stay over

toffs im her majestys highland servant indoors and out theres no stopping me now but im the only one she trusts the womans surrounded by fools she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning knowing that lot theyll still be dressing her at eight aye but will they one box of biscuits one box of drop tablets one box of pralines sixteen chocolate sponges its the same order every week but does anybody bother to check it now she has to travel all the way to balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys aye then shes obviously not got enough to do which one of us is she flirting with im not sure i do archie what she loved him its only grief makes her like she is if you were looking for promotion you should have picked one of the healthier ones prince leopold

as well as stupid are you deaf as well as stupid shes away to windsor tomorrow talk to her there shes busy its the queens decision back and upper corridors youll talk when im finished what happens to john brown is his business but the queens security will never be compromised thats a tautology lad if you say the queen arranges something youve no need to say shes done it personally thats understood my own not now he doesnt this is my place i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard in the event of any disturbance i will ensure nobody has any rights over me this is a slur on her good name dont think i cant persuade her if i find out that you had anything to do with this i will have you sacked it can wait anything else that can wait till the weekend shell be away on friday between eight oclock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt if shes to make the journey there and back in the day shes to have no distractions the night before shell take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early is that the queens request well you tell her majesty from me if her husband was here now hed have had her out of that house and getting some air in her what the hells the point in me being here otherwise no i didnt come all this way to sit on my arse awaiting my orders do you i came down at the queens request ill take my orders from her aye do thats not good enough i need a man who knows where i am wholl bring it to me how will i know what she requires how will i know shell think i betrayed her shell never understand it i promised to protect her from people like you no loyalty too busy looking after themselves the threat i tell them but they dont see it they dont see it her mind is set she wont change now so why do you think i keep her here i said i serve the queen aye i do what i do why maybe once what i do i do for my queen i wouldnt know this is the top im not married its nothing im fine i dont think about it you sent for me always remember you keep it tight to your shoulder you absorb the kick aim for the head then imagine its gladstone if you hunt you kill dare say you can be taught do you hunt what do you know about the highlands what brings you here someone has to look after you it couldve been someone it was before because i have to when i took you out riding come rain or shine because i knew it was right for you when i kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace when i saw you safe from home to home and you didnt even know i was there all ive ever thought about is you for gods sake woman im just trying to keep you safe im breaking no promises have i ever let you down before if duty and safety are served by the same end then aye i do i had foreseen that you would not but your majesty should understand that my mind will not be changed in this i leave for deeside having considered my position here at court i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign maam yes maam yes maam yes maam ill decide when its exaggerated aye but there are fenians reported on the mainland i ordered it its for your own safety i heard something aye we took a nip of whiskey ah well theyre ready now aye well if all you want is a good opinion then hed be sure to oblige you just say what you have to say woman what other people think shouldnt matter to you i dont groom a horse to have it admired by others i groom it because it needs grooming that doesnt make him an expert what does he know about the highlands who by are they worth reading craobhangeanmchnofhiadhaich what aye maam if prince albert were here today hed tell him a thing or two its a fine spot maam and i intend to be there when shes ready because i think her majesty is wrong if ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air it is her yes maam yes maam yes maam archie ive no family maam apart from my brothers and sisters im glad of it shes well too i am aye maam maamquite im flattered you think so a situation i see of course i take no account of gossip your highness i dont think ive had that pleasure your royal highness what a pleasure to see you here but others will know that you acted for the greater good in time she will for once in my life i am not the issue no love the greasy pole they arent as watchful as you see what she trusts you john the truth is the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense ah but therein lies the paradox it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents the longer she is away the stronger they become and who honestly can promise security against that however many doors you lock someone will always get in even here you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism no other aspiration but yourself what about john brown for her majesty to have achieved ones ambition or to have reconciled oneself to its limits is a lifetimes work then i envy yo was there never ambition surely the look on their faces when one walks into the room still gives one a ridiculous thrill oh still someone must attend you your wife should not have let you out youre injured forgive me ive called you out and you should have been resting princes and lords are but the breath of kings an honest mans the noblest work of god you must miss such magnificent views ive been called back to london my last day i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar quite to shoot perhaps but not to kill occasionally i am a blank sheet a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen it was remiss of me not to come earlier oh several things youve seen the latest cartoon in punch i take it not at all dean good of you to spare the time yes no maam forgive me maam i can not speak for the nation only for myself as prime minister i confess i miss your presence but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it in so many ways and yet it is your presence they crave a figurehead indeed and for that they are eternally grateful your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance as for your people look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen you sell even more copies than mr dickens i was trying to imagine rather upset whats her excuse this time in the press perhaps but shes sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year time to wheel her out mrs brown gladstones got his party facing the same way for the first time in years we need help where is the old girl were going to lose to know when hell be king i hope he got his mothers permission well see which way the wind blows gossip counts lord aberdeen was right this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk granted it wouldnt take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning but if public opinion is against her then it doesnt do to appear too close my dear stanley a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion the question is do we need her the cartoon or her majestys absenteeismthe queen will be riding to st georges on the fifth we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control mr brown even you in as much as the article is about yourself i think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you i dont doubt that the queen was highly amused she has always had a very healthy sense of humor i believe that decision rests with her majesty there are important papers from shell need to sign dispatches before she retires yes it most certainly is go inside at once i thought i made myself perfectly clear you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it i beg your pardon you will await your orders like everyone else unless you prefer a repeat of yesterdays little excitement you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it you know that very well yes i do in matters concerning the household i act on her behalf there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household then well have to see what can be arranged im sure it wont be difficult to find you her highness equerry youll be sent a message im sorry her majestys routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it the household remains in full mourning and noone is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever as for the queens routine she breakfasts at nine thirty lunches at twotakes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home on the rare occasions when she is out you may ask permission to leave but only with my consent youre to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten oclock youll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires no indeed some young page was boasting about having seen it lucky quite i think id best take it back we think she can be dissuaded have you had a glance at the diary the queen wishes to publish an account of him not too protracted i hope no she wasnt a fine choice sir maam maam they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness from princess helena and other members of your family i have a letter maam there is one other matter your majesty i forgive me maam i am no wiser than yourself i have no idea again we were expecting you to return by six he thought perhaps your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government lord clarendon arrives by invitation at eleven oclock followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alices birthday dispatches as usual at two the chancellor writes to say that by happy coincidence he will be in cowes for the weekend he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience of course at once im very sorry maam i cant imagine he was certainly given no instructionsthe princess louisa is too ill to move frankly the queens rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity youre smiling shes refusing to leave balmoral its questionable whether theres any advantage to be had from that direction shes never been less popular who you cant know that for sure what did he want i see the prince of wales is here so surely youre not suggesting we dispense well both should we take it seriouslypart of being a new yorker i honestly wish i could what well im close to her i wanted to meet the one that got away something like that you should look like you dressed yourself trouser width this is all classic which means safe something id wear well then ill take it up with her oh youre more than okay good girl digger and george are with family in the hamptons until monday

talk to me im in the bridge dawn come in i will once i get past the bulkhead good luck i cant dont worry about me theres still a chance i can issue a distress signal im going to try and buy you some time i can get to the bridge from here theres only room on that pod for seven thats you and the others im counting on you to get them out of there im not going with you a little dabll do ya now you know how to get there right no take this flare thats why we need a safe passage remember what you said earlier about getting through the wall that might just be our ticket a schematic of the ship looking for a lifeline to the pods the room is filled with poison gas the hydraulic system must have blown it was no time to lose my partner were going to have to hurry hes on to us dawn dawn dont worry about what will happen just concentrate on what is happening youll live longer do you want some advice well dawn im an optimist by nature yeah one of barnes duds luckily for us take this out of the equation right now be careful you dont want to puncture the suit youre ready for the real thing so we did are you ready i dont know what were facing simulated space walking i cant let you do that everyone just stay put if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal yeah lets hope he can find a way through close every door behind you youre right and suppose you couldnt hold out i dont know the condition of the compartments depending on damage debriscould be a fatal mistake damn it if only we could get to those suits dawn then thinks of something great seen one like it before with what how am i going to interface with it i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me it depends on the condition of the ship if i could get to one of the suit

i used to care about what happened now i think ill sell my house and move the fuck away because i was driving behind the bus mary because i saw it i saw it happen ill help pay for nicole if thats what youre really talking about ill even give you the money i got for my kids thats what we used to do remember help each other this was a community why you got money from dolores insurance with the school board we all did weve got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards weve got people pointing fingers making side deals and dickering over percentages yesterday i heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad the rescue squad because they didnt act fast enough thats wrong sam you know that well be tangled up in this thing for the next five years this is never going to go away if that bastard does subpoena me if he forces me to go over this again then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing but yours is the one whos going to subpoena me sam force me to testify in court he came by the garage this afternoon gave me this piece of paper ive tried to stay out of it but it turns out thats not so easy sam youve gone and got yourself this lawyer mitchell stephens you and risa and wendell and the ottos well i dont want a damned thing to do with it why not how it does concern me well sam i might as well tell you the truth its this lawsuit youve gotten yourself all involved with i want you to drop the damned thing you think that caused the accident risa that it brought bad luck christ it sounds to me youre looking for a witch doctor not a lawyer or maybe theyre the same thing yes well i dont why you believe that risa i serviced that bus at the garage theres nothing wrong with it i stopped by the station a while ago i stared at the bus i could almost hear the kids inside there was a lawyer there he told me hed gotten you signed up is that true good night i better get back sure well maybe thats because they know im going to follow them behind the bus its natural thats because he misses you what are you thinking what times he coming home does this mean i cant take a shower a while she said shes got to be home by nine nicoles coming over to look after the kids tonight shell be there around sixill tell her that i will alison mitchell it was nice to see you again ally nothing we made it to the hospital i didnt have to go as far as i was prepared to but i was prepared to go all the way i didnt know i was in a panic i guessed shed been bitten by an insect but there was no doctor the nearest hospital was forty miles away and zoe was continuing to swell klara took her in her arms and tried to breastfeed her while i dialed the hospital i finally got a doctor on the line he sounded young but cool he was confident but there was a nervousness he have been an intern this was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this he wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing but he was just as scared as i was i woke to the sound of zoes breathing it was laboured i looked over and noticed she was sweating and all swollen i grabbed her rushed to the kitchen and splashed water on her face imso sorry it turns to steaming piss yes do you find theres something strange about this meat thats where im going to see her she didnt other clinics oh sure clinics halfway houses treatment centers detox units sunnyridge that was a long time which clinic which one are you still in touch yesfine werenot together ally jones and what does he do again im just fine ally what about you ally thats right yes alison jones im telling you this because weve all lost our children mr ansel thats my daughter or it may be the police to tell me that theyve found her dead shes a drug addict im telling you this because weve all lost our children mr ansel thats my daughter or it may be the police to tell me that theyve found her dead shes a drug addict the walkers have agreed the ottos nicole burnells parents its important to initiate proceedings right away things get covered up people lie thats why we have to begin our investigation quickly before the evidence disappears thats why im out here tonight you can help each other several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit your case as an individual will be stronger if im allowed to represent you together as a group no mr ansel i wouldnt sue you i can help you i understand my name is why would he be frightened thats what he said is it there might have been a word or two that slipped by maybe you could clarify it for me just to be absolutely sure yes excuse me its clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event mrs driscoll if billy ansel does not volunteer to say so in court i will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect i did yes he does billy ansel will insist that you were driving fiftyone miles an hour just like youve done every morning for the past fifteen years that would complicate things whats that dolores did they give him special care did his parents attend to that you mentioned that he had a learning disability were his parentsattentive to him and whats that berrypicking berries you talked about it did he have any particular problems that you knew of financial pressuresrunins with the law from what for rabbits and they loved bear do they have any reputation for drugs yes what do you mean by hippies what do you mean by that dolores illtake it straight no a little sugar though how long has dolores been driving that bus mr otto how many times has she steered clear of danger what went wrong that morning a cup of tea would be nice would it be alright if i sit down for a few minutes mrs otto i want to talk to you unless the report from the national weather bureau for the district on january 23 goes into the record i will object to that question so you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this its not going to be easy nicole do you understand that yes doloresand even your mom and dad but ill make sure you go last im absolutely positive theres no such thing as an accident nicole not in a situation like this i dont want you to lie they work for the people were trying to sue their job is to try to minimize damages our job nicole is to try to maximize them you have to think of it that way as people doing their jobs no good guys or bad guys just our side and their side it would be strange if you didnt feel that way that you didnt die like the other children you hate that i have no questions note that she said pretty clearly not clearly note my objection she said as im talking i object to that form of question note that i object to the form of that question note that have they ever been busted crafts what do they do thats good judges like adopted indian boys tell me more about the ottos indian tell me about the ottos thats great wendell thats the sort of thing i need to know so it doesnt come back to haunt our case later on people who will help our cause thats the local bar when what about doreen hard to say i might havesome business here do you have a room here we go is this it how old is she you always think youre prepared for these things need a hand i love you zoe ill be there soon and ill take care of you no matter what happens ill take care of you yes i can hear you breathing too ofcourse i do i just thoughti could get you another do you have the blood test what for what do you want me to do zoe ill do whatever you want yes yes thats not news zoe tell me your news zoe yes give me your news zoe news yes yes ill accept the charges ii just need to know what state youre in so i knowhow to talk to youhow to act yes the problem is i have no idea who im talking to right now nothings wrong with trying to talk to me zoe why are you calling me zoe im in a car wash well lets see what we get if you could pick the shrimp off as well as anything that touches the shrimp is there shrimp on it what is it im afraid this meat is overdone if you agree to have me represent you in this suit i will require no payment until after the case is won when i will require one third of the awarded amount if there is no award made then my services will cost you nothing its a standard agreement no listen to me mrs otto listen very carefully i do know whats best excuse me mrs otto there is no such thing as an accident the word doesnt mean anything to me as far as im concerned somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a tencent bolt and a million dollar outofcourt settlement they decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference thats whats done mrs otto ive seen it happen so many times before its my belief that dolores was doing exactly what shed been doing for years besides the school boards insurance on dolores is minimal a few million at the very most the really deep pockets are to be found in the town or in the company that made the bus you are angry arent you mrs otto thats why im here to give your anger a voice to be your it should be said that my task is to represent the walkers only in their anger not their grief yes the walkers spoke very highly of you please please let me explain ill only take a moment of your time im a lawyer im sorry for coming over unannounced like this mrs otto but the walkers said you would understand i know its an awful time but its important that we talk how does the family survive any criminal record in what way noim sorry its not enough for hospital bills for nicole no billy we cant drop the lawsuit you know how much we need the money cmon you know that wont that wont happen billy mitch stephens case is small compared to some of those other guys the way he told me all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day driving behind the bus i know its a painful thing to do but itll only take a few minutes of your time thatll be the end of it so i mean lots of folks have got lawyers okay fine sostay out of it because its what we have to do well it being so depressing and all but its reality you cant just turn this off because you happen to think its a bad idea well i dont know why it should theres a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits were hardly unique here billy i mean i can understand how you feel i dont see how that concerns you billy so what brings you out tonight hey billy what brings you out on a night like this cmon in take a load off is he coming over now right away was he drinking could you tell did he say what about theres talk of that its too late for that she cant drive the bus anymore the school board saw to that right off i dont know okay yes well okay ill take you about ninethirty in the morning thats okay with you what do you mean you seemi dont knowwell distant i guess hard to talk to nicole tomorrow mr stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse i thought id take you over are you sleeping nothing good on your tv what are you up to nicole well mr stephens is representing several families the ottos the walkers us and i think a couple more mr stephens is suing the town for negligence hes sure that the accident could have been avoided if they had done their jobs right hes a very smart man partly but theres a lot the insurance doesnt cover thats one of the reasons we have a lawyer to make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest youre going to need special care for a long time to come its not going to be easy not for you not for any of us because we love you so much and its going to cost money more than we can imagine its because of the accident nicole most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers a lot of peoplewell people in this town are very angry us included well yes hes your lawyer too hes a lawyer hes our lawyer oh i better get some spackle sure ill fix it right away and i had to widen a few doors youll see do you like the colour pretty slick eh how do you like it nicole dont even try to remember does it fit whats that what took so long whats so funny i am really it was awesome of course youre going to blow everyone away that was greatthank you nicole and what was the weather like at this time did there come a time when the bus turned off staples mill road onto there was nothing reckless in mrs driscolls behavior was the bus on time what do you remember about the accident you remember this there wasnt time why not did you say anything to mrs driscoll you saw the speedometer you believe that the bus driven by mrs driscoll was going at seventy two miles an hour at this time seventytwo miles an hour youre sure of this how fast would you say mrs driscoll was going to the best of your recollection you could see the speedometer mrs driscoll was driving too fast what made you think that nicole why were you scared this is before the accident nicole do you understand what im asking why were you scared yes i will offer that report well then now that your memory seems to be clearing can you tell us what else you observed at that time you are you remember that much did there come a time when all the children had been picked up and according to your recollection there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning and where did you sit that morning was there anything unusual about the driver dolores driscoll or the bus that particular morning was anyone waiting for the bus with you what time in the morning was this now on that morning did there come a time nicole when you left your parents houseoh god im scared i can hear you breathing daddy you dont believe me you dont fucking believe me you

and bring a cannon the damn thing is huge where the hell are you ippolito get back here you said the system couldnt fail what doors that would leave one exit for hundreds of people youd be violating every fire regulation on the books well guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells one more question i see a big hole if this entire thing is run by computer what happens if the power fails thats great if youre stopping a burglar not our goal here are there motion detectors the cops are nonnegotiable ippolito why dont you just tell me how this space station works the subbasement huh great idea everybody get behind me i smell it its here the subbasement pendergast help its right behind us i think i should come with you how big is the subbasement youve been holding out on me pendergast you have a suspect capable of this i dont like animals never have dog bit me when i was little after that i gave up on pets animals are irrational give me a psychotic killer any day if theres one thing that makes me queasy its being part of a food chain my first case as a rookie two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo it was late august over ninety the polar bear was inside his cave kids didnt know he was in there all they saw was the pool they got to swimming and splashing the noise woke up the bear by the time i arrived both little boys were in pieces the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot i can still hear the mother screaming saliva test you mean you think someone ate part of the brain what happened to them oh you think what weve got here is a monster as big as a house that smells like hamburger they heard the victims name and wove him into their story nice touch ive got to admit that was a damn sight better than the dog ate my homework youre kidding so the method of death is the only connection who didnt big news out of brazil wasnt it call me vince then you wont like this one its a piece of shit i drink after hours of course on duty i smoke do you mind cant really focus on birds at the moment pendergast im tryin to keep my breakfast down night watchman who found the body sweet old man been tossing his cookies for over an hour not a likely suspect careful that mess on the ground is brains we need light in here stat whats left of it vince dagosta am i out who are you the undertaker shouldnt a drug that powerful be destroyed pardon my french but bull shit look its some kind of letter this place is a maze id say were in its home whats that doing here what does it say all right everybody hold up not so loud all right kawakita cover the rear how much ammo do we have to make a stand i know theres a dead body in the exhibit people are panicking trampling each other trying to get out got my hands full here what is itthe virus itself might have positive applications theyll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made greg isnt joining us this on top of the scratches isnt it proof did you hear that my god he says that mbwun is real may i see that im one of the few who know every inch it now that john is gone look whos here margo remember it has poor eyesight it hunts with its sense of smell so for gods sake margo dont get those fibers on your clothes come back and get me im coming with you we cant weve managed to get inside the one place thats safe i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements if we go outside were risking more lives you have to accept it margo theres nothing we can do the building must be swarming with police by now it wont take long for them to get through the doors its one of the fire doors good lord margo were trapped dont stop now some kind of power failure maybe its the storm do you have a flashlight its like ringing the dinner bell margo what youve just described is a killing machine so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night quadrupedal the other name for mbwun he who walks on all fours thats not so unusual many plants carry viruses like the burls on maple trees come on margo were on the verge of something huge lets consider the possibility just the three of us alone in this room what if john was right i mean what if and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates when it got to the museum it hatched like the claw theyre eggs margo these arent seed pods youre right im not sure as you know the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant let me see the plant press i cant help thinking theres something that pendergast overlooked if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard it wants something thats in here cuthberts counting on the exhibitions success the museum is in debt contributions and public funding have dried up admissions no longer cover overhead the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red if the superstition exhibit isnt lucrative hell have to start auctioning off some of these gems everyone needs a change of scenery ive been rolling down these halls for fortyodd years thats quite enough this isnt a death sentence greg has promised to teach me fly fishing ill garden ill write you must come on ill walk you back to the elevator healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art with all due respect dear thats bull you dance rings around me with your new technology youve left me in the dust yes it is im tired and im no longer needed no margo this is one problem you cant solve you have to stay out of it the fact is i want to retire please dont humiliate me further that apparently is the problem im yesterdays news who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants monsters and dinosaurs cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm now margo dont overreact cuthbert has to cut costs somehow my leaving makes perfect sense this isnt exactly early retirement ive overstayed the party a bit yes bit of a shock but as cuthbert so tactfully put it the museum needs new blood and since ive been here since the mesozoic era they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta whats that margo this is too dangerous you always think you can solve everything this time you dont have enough information the animal might behave in unexpected ways leave her here with me dont put her in danger we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate i dont know it was walled over no ones been down there in years not really just the subbasement yes dear louis tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where well be in the greatest danger so im sending carlos back with the crates you always believed in me louis even in the darkest days so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded weve made an incredible find i enclose a representation of mbwun note the exaggerated claws the reptilian attributes the hints of bipedalia its beyond belief but this statue is accurate i know because ive seen the beast its from john those two arrows were his insignia its addressed to louis moriarty a patron who financed his expeditions this means there must be an animal loose in the museum something tried to get into this room yes john made quite a study of the whole museum he had a copy of my original plans they fill seven floors we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world just to give you an idea there are more than three million insects specimens not to mention amphibians reptiles birds anthropological artifacts meteorites minerals and gems only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display happy to be useful its rare enough these days according to security beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area 1012i understand but mr cuthbert weve got bigger problems depending on what we find today we may have to shut you down yes if the party goes forward and thats a big if ive arranged for a large police presence ive read about the museums financial troubles i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesis forum sketches nice to see you lieutenant go out the north exit theres a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases run ive been down there it links up to the old sewer system i can guide you out vince theres no way we can get to you with the fire doors down theres an entrance to the sub basement in the hall off the north side exit this doors locked try shooting the hinges off we havent got time you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight apparently its huge this isnt an animal vince ive been on this case four months remember ive learned a few things correct if you dont mind a suggestion you might try a saliva test no i think what weve got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon who wants us to believe hes a monster i believed them how do you explain the part about beauregard unfortunately no if you dont mind this could be important no theres more there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat yes thats my case now its yours all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way decapitated brains extracted limbs torn to shreds it looked like the work of a large animal but there was no sign of an animal on board did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago twelve bodies on board lieutenant not at all i enjoy the smell of a good cigar in this violent world i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things an original roger tory peterson of a redbreasted merganser amazing i have a copy of this in my office at home whose footprints wheres the head mind if i have a look the body not at all i think we may be working on the same case if so i could use your help special agent pendergast fbi the thalamus and the hypothalamus perhaps someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa i hope you liked it weve met the hacksaw murders 89 dr frock i was wondering what happened to the rest of whittlesleys plants footsteps hes right i dont believe it you said you had plans of the museum could we see them please where is that are there any hidden rooms or staircases places where someone could hide you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum read it out loud i wouldnt be so sure and failed these doors are solid steel do you mean dr whittlesley how many storage areas are there thank you for taking the time to help us with this dr frock keep the animal quiet another storage room quiet not on the map looks like it connects with the city sewer come on lets get back to the others we cant leave them alone hes right follow me get back now stop shut them up keep the light up i cant see not yet lets try the fork to the left hard to read in this light the ink is so faded im in town on a case dropped by to see vince and we thought wed see the new display you have to do it now he has to look here or i wont get a clear shot call him margo i have to shoot whatever that thing is we have to kill it i dont believe it what were not going to make the storage room its coming run oh god help its deceptively simple like a bruckner symphony or a matisse how for what then it wont go after the others it didnt want the fibers what does that mean what happened its scared of me hide quickly no the planetarium is in the next cell this is one of the fire doors vince that was dagosta youd slow us down and put margo in danger but what can we do our guns are useless but this isnt the jungle this is new york how did it get here a thing like that crossed two continents it makes no sense i dont know how to deal with this its hellish like nothing i ever saw im not trained to deal with a monster a supernatural creature like that no a chromium alloy tipped 45 caliber bullet bounced off that things skull like a spit ball i think it was bothered by my light gone no i think im hallucinating we need someone to take us to the secure storage area genetic damage what was it theyre all heavily armed dr green all right if youre positive where did you see it i heard you calling and i ran after you but you kept disappearing and i couldnt keep up what happened all right im as macho as you are perhaps where would we find it would you mind showing it to me i dont think so i think we were meant to think it was mbwun did whittlesleys monster have claws something came up in autopsy tonight imbedded in beauregards body we found a claw what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there was he desperate enough to create one what happened a monster tell me about the last expedition what was he looking for you were afraid of him werent you i ran an internet search on dr whittlesley got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times i also found a record of your restraining order you were going to be married you loved him the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten just like beauregard one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact disappeared his body wasnt among the victims dr whittlesley was last seen in belem venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat that boat washed up in my district everyone on board was killed you have time to talk maybe not no i came to talk about dr john whittlesley how does it work special agent pendergast fbi forgive me i guess i was snooping what is thisi put the diamond in my coat pocket and i put my coat on her were too late i make my own luck then thats our

and whats that my dear dont pout sidney i invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story hes from lloyds of london arent you mr bond your choice look at the time come theres someone i want you meet about a story im thinking of publishing you see mr bond you and i are both men of action but your era is passing words are the new weapons satellites the new artillery and make no mistake about it in the right hands they can be as deadly as your walther ppk fantastic idea mr bond perhaps i should buy it for a book its totally preposterous but you amuse me and now perhaps i can amuse you theyre merely tools to disseminate information welcome to the new world order mr bond churchill had his armies caesar had his legions i have my divisions news sports business entertainment and these are my foot soldiers 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers 4 cable news networks 87 magazines and 29 different cable tv channels in 35 languages because its a dying city since the chinese takeover who knows what can happen tomorrow in any case this is my father charles a royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations said id never amount to anything but i turned it into this my third great uncle the earl of aberdeen negotiated the purchase of hong kong from the chinese his soninlaw george harmsway made the first family fortune running opium into shanghai his son thomas who lost it smoking the opium and my grandfather henry who opened the first telegraph station and published the colonys first english newspaper it was a city of unlimited possibility i call this the rogues gallery by the way what is it that brings you to kuala lumpur mister bond still i do miss her i only wish she could have lived to see all this the only difference between a psychopath and a genius mr bond is the degree of success i tried to save her but she remained a manic depressive fits inappropriate behavior delusions of grandeur before i became involved with paris she was always involved with the most inappropriate men playboys thrill seekers middle aged peter pans who only brought out the worst in her come lets get out of the noise ill give you a tour of the building then well talk mr bond nice to see you oh please mr bond we live in the information age information is currency and with the right currency you can have any piece of information

the british government says i wont kill this story miss oxford will show both of you to the elevator and one of my people will definitely be in touch sooner than later well i do believe this requires further investigation i see but as ive explained to sidney without proof theres just no story dont you agree mr bond obviously the british government denies all of this i see you two have met you come with me you stay here a hundred and fifty years ago my ancestors took this island a barren lifeless rock and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization and now that im being forced to give it back i intend to return it in exactly the same condition a barren lifeless rock the gold is merely reparations payment from the spineless british government who wouldnt listen hong kong mr bond bore through they used to say living well was the best revenge mr bond theyre wrong revenge is the best revenge start the grinders please sidney id like to remember you fondly excellent dont worry mr bond will get the message so will his boss kill him finish it what the hell is going on no i have a better idea in fact mr bond may have actually improved my original plan bring them both to hong kong and make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve built to withstand a nuclear blast are they alive i should have hired this man get somebody up there get more men up there good we have an appointment in hong kong is the helicopter ready mr stamper will escort you to the plane but because i am a just man ive decided to give mr hussein what he deserves you disappoint me number three and theres no truth that 10 of that money will go into your swiss bank account havent we already paid him for his servicesnow if you think were going to have some kind of life affirming romance here just because we cheated death let me be clear were going to have it where i want and when i want first that boat is in international waters im claiming it for salvage onethird of that gold is mine before

london girls who falls for the lies no shut up lets not make it a habit i see my date is here and i think mr bond is ready to leave the strait can be a very dangerous place mr bond a few words
