chevaliers intentions i had thought you more expert you must find out if the chevalier cheats he sees the english and austrian envoys continually and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house find out what they talk of for how much each plays especially if any of them play on parole if you are able to read his private letters though about those which go to the post you need not trouble yourself we look at them there but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes and by what channel or messenger he sleeps with the keys of his dispatchbox with a string around his neck twenty frederics if you get an impression of the keys you are a hungarian you served in the army and left on account of weakness in the loins he gambles a great deal and wins do you

the prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money he would have to fight for it only a very little as soldiers do what is the service sir the captain was the nephew and heir of the minister of police herr galgenstein a relationship which no doubt aided in the younger gentlemens promotion how do you do sir neither sir im a british officer upon my word sir i think you have acted very coolly wheres the beauty you promised me the place seems more a farm than an innyard this may be a very good inn for germany but it would not pass in old ireland corbach is only a league off let us push on for corbach ogrady my companion treated me with great civility and asked me a thousand questions about england which i answered as best i might but this best i am bound to say was bad enough i knew nothing about england and i invented a thousand stories which i told him described the king and the ministers to him said the british ambassador in berlin was my uncle and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him the coward mrs john best was there another mr john best good heavens whatever has she died of grief is miss dugan well i suppose she addressed them to me in my real name by which i never thought to ask for them at the post office grogan gave me a wink of recognition but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters and then shaking hands with me cordially gave me news which i wanted of my family a man of honor dies but never apologizes ill see the captain hanged before i apologize not against castle dugan gate that has been off the hinges these ten years ill match any man with the sword i hope to spoil this sport and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bullys body i am harry james son and will act as becomes my name and quality it was with this sword that my late father harry james god rest his soul met sir huddelstone fuddelstone the hampshire baronet and was fatally run through the neck he was quite in the wrong having insulted lady fuddelstone when in liquor at the brentford assembly but like a gentleman he scorned to apologize my mare is saddled and ready whos the captains second have you taken my message to him hell give the better mark i am not afraid of him mark this come what will of it i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan ill follow him if its into the church and meet him there ill have his blood or he shall have mine will you take my message to him and arrange the meeting and so i am dorothy might love

sirrah sirrah i am as good a gentleman as any in ireland ah i see no im afraid mine are the ohiggins of watertown which ohiggins do you know for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyships money and pearls perfectly certain because i shall make him tremble i risk nothing for i am certain to kill him it is distasteful to kill a scoundrel that should be work for a hangman when the duke of courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags what did we ask then ordering fresh horses the chevalier set off on his journey for that capital i need not tell you that i was the chevalier but how sir but if they send you away then what is to become of me i believe they will deport you but they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost i can play as soldiers do but have no great skill and i think he was as much affected as i was at thus finding one of his kindred for he too was an exile from home and a friendly voice a look brought the old country back to his memory again and the old days of his boyhood only the agency of servants no one sir before that i served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins herr seebach was a very kind employer yes sir yes sir here is my letter that is a trifle strong on the instant everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you very well now that i know it i will no longer love her certainly monseigneur does not your excellency consider her worthy of love lady cosgrove you are an old fool my lady cosgroves relationship with me was a singular one her life was passed in a series of crackbrained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me we would quarrel for a fortnight then we should be friends for a month together sometimes one day i was joking her and asking her whether she would take the water again whether she had found another lover and so forth she suddenly burst out into tears and after a while said to me we then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that from time to time her ladyship cried out oh my god is it true i am not dreaming let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that i am happy o my dearest love enough i beg you stop believing in your experience you have never known love my very soul is leaving me catch it on your lips and give me yours sir william cosgrove is a man who is dying and yet i envy him more than any man in christendom he enjoys a privilege of which i am deprived he may take you in his arms whenever he pleases and no veil keeps his senses his eyes his soul from enjoying your beauty let us give each other complete happiness and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires they will each time be born anew i know better than you do love wants a more substantial fare and if it is stubbornly withheld it withers away will we always leave it at this i ask only a payment on account today after that you will find me undemanding obedient and discreet yes but i am afraid of being deceived then i will respectfully take leave of her with a woman who is completely charming be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition and who regardless of her rank will show me some kindness tonight deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me if i do not know it i am innocent to love you until death to subscribe to all your commands it is my only object by loving you with no hope of possessing you i believe you and i see i must hasten to leave for otherwise i shall become the unhappiest of men i agree but god put us on earth to take that risk that is true but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love it is nonetheless a misfortune and you will know it when you love then you have never loved your heart is empty what you have not met a man worthy of your attention have you not a man whom you value how can i believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you but for a time a passing fancy have you had one indeed miss dorothy i intend to have his blood as sure as my names roderick well then ill tell you what id do id jump daisy into the river and swim you both across where no enemy could follow us id draw my sword and cut my way through them if ever i meet him again you shall see which is the best man of the two ill fight him with sword or with pistol captain as he is but you refused me dorothy were you obliged to dance five times with captain best and then stroll out with him into the garden i hate miss clancy you know i do and i only danced with her because because the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night with pleasure at finding the ribbon i feel the ribbon do you see the gate at the end of the field the first to touch it will be the winner i accept but i insist on a wager the loser must do whatever the winner pleases all right five hundred guineas it is entirely up to you i want the best yes for i wish to entertain splendidly as much as possible yes by name only and to be sure i did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done and this was the distinguished solicitor and former government minister lord west whose acquaintance i made as i had so many others at the gaming table what is to be done when is he to go the prince left him only that choice in so far as i can tell these things no i believe the chevalier won the money fairly yes minister i am interested in any work in which i can be of service to captain galgenstein how different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at kilwangan assemblies in every sentence she mentioned a lord or a person of quality to the ladys question about my birth and parentage i replied that i was a young gentleman of large fortune that i was going to dublin for my studies and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum as you have been robbed of your purse may i have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home ohiggins mohawk ohiggins i am riding to dublin myself and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you i shall do my best to protect you from further mishap be off to your work you pack of rascals or you will have a good taste of my thong have you lost much what has happened madam to annoy your ladyship i see yes of course provided that they can be assured of her ladyships freewill are you serious i am prepared to accept the terms mr newcombe mr newcombe i have made some difficult loans during the past few years at very onerous terms but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed yes hes fine your bother is in america fighting the rebels i promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to doolans farm to see him what the devil what kind of fools do we have here pottle who told the lad this story yes good night my little darling well well just have to wait and see wont we now just have a little patience my boy your birthday isnt until next week sir let those laugh that win i hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon knight well if my intentions are what you think they are if i do wish to step into your shoes what then i have no other intentions than you had yourself lady cosgroves wealth may be great but am i not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily her rank is lofty but not so lofty as my ambition i will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my lady cosgrove as you ever showed her and if i win her and wear her when you are dead and gone corbleu knight do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me faith sir if i want to learn good principles its surely better i should apply for them to your lady and your chaplin than to you i think sir william cosgrove you have had too much drink your chaplin mr hunt has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter of which she is a considerable expert i beg your pardon sir william cosgrove with his complication of ills was dying before us by inches he was continually tinkered up by doctors and what with my usual luck he might be restored to health and live i dont know how many years if cosgrove would not die where was the use of my pursing his lady but my fears were to prove groundless for on that very night patient nature would claim her account the milkmaids daughter would you have me spend my life all alone i made sir william cosgroves acquaintance as usual at the play table one could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime for though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases a cripple wheeled about in a chair and suffering pangs of agony yet you would see him every morning and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth tender hegenheim will he wish to know the details of this night if his love were like mine he would not permit you to come here and he doesnt care about me do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight dark valdez

4th of july beach is like ringing a dinner bell for chrissake theres no limits to where he can strike and weve had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days it happened like this before in 1916 when a great white killed five swimmers at jones beach in long island there is a kind of shark called a great white shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater no shark did that to a boat you all right be careful for chrissake why dont we just tow it in dont they have lifejackets or something an extra boat what happened we got ta get back soon youre at the institute full time or do you have a job whered you get all this can you tell from that if a big man eater is around what is all this stuff chum what do we do he ate a car how can you tell what what whats that what stinks so bad and before 1900 when people first starting swimming for recreation before public bathing and resorts there were very few shark attacks cause sharks didnt know what they were missing yeah rogue picks out an area where theres food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts theres a kind of a lone shark called uh something else do most attacks go unreported drowning lem me ask you something is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water around 10 feet from the beach lets all have a drink swell what dya mean you did it did ben gardner catch this no we just checked the beach no it was local jurisdiction who are you youre tellin me i swear this town has gone crazy pretty stiff what dyou pay for a place just for the summer you here for the summer you from around here

some of the steps ive taken as chief of police im responsible for public safety around here look ive got to talk to her this isnt a contest we want the whole country entering doctor youre the one who

there you were on the indianapolis in 45 jesus this is quite a place i hope we get some more help out there is a perfect engine an eating machine that is a miracle of evolution it swims and eats and thats all look at that those proportions are correct i know sharks im familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass there are only two ways to solve this thing you can kill it or you can cut off its food supply i just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there a sharks attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you cant avoid it youre situation here suggests that a great white has staked out a claim in the waters around amity island and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water a white a great white i found a tooth buried in the hull he mustve attacked i knew it gardners dead in there i didnt see the mate we will theres something ive got to find out he didnt have a dinghy aboard im going down to take a look at his hull they mustve hit something i want to check something hold my feet it is a job im not fooling around like some amateur its my life i bought it both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me stocks went up so i dont have to touch my principal sometimes look here something big probably a school of mackerel clumped together and staying right with us depthfinder fathometer sonar closedcircuit tv fore and aft rdf single side band and two loose nuts behind the wheel only one sure way to find him offer him a little something to eat chum blood waste meat fish anything they can sense it miles away if hes out there we might be able to get a closer look at him its a good time too theyre night feeders if youre looking for a shark you dont look on land you go out and chum for him nothing no but tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean they eat anything but this one didnt eat any people theres nothing here florida license plate just as i thought he drifted up here with the gulf stream from southern waters half a flounder hmmm a burlap bag a paint can aha our friend the shark and it was dartmouth winter weekend and she was homecoming queen and i was her date then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family and she was right her greatgrandfather was in mining and my ancestors were yankee shipbuilders so we broke up and i went home with some beatnik from sarah lawrence you could say that its called territoriality its a theory rogue about half of them a lot of missing swimmers are really shark victims yeah like the kid on your beach i wish i couldve examined that shark they caught we ought to let it breathe whatever dynamite how was your day there are hundreds of different kinds of sharks makos blues hammerheads whitetips any one of them couldve attacked look shark digestion is slow we could open this one up and find whatever hes been eating is still inside i didnt say this wasnt the shark i just said i wasnt sure this was the one well if one man can catch a fish in 50 days then i guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day beginners luck it wasnt an accident it wasnt a boat propeller or a coral reef or jack the ripper it was a shark it was a shark left arm head shoulders sternum and portions of ribcage intact please dont smoke with minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions bite marks indicate typical nonfrenzy feeding pattern of large squali possibly carchaninus lonimanus or isurus glaucas gross tissue loss and postmortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis however teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters did you go out in a

to look for you yes who is there we live in 703 i hit it i hit it with my cane then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator down to the garbage please pardon me i am niccolo spergazzi i am a resident here i dont know we were walking in the hallway and cabiria my wife she was attacked by this thing here on her armok rog see you at ten i dunno try tranquilizers once you can get at them theres a lotta stuff you can use ill bring a bagful its just the standard tropical kit but the trick is to get at them yeah ah i dont want to panic you or anything but i mean the way hobbes designed them theyre supposed to get out of hand real quick so you dont have much time to think about whats happening to you once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream i dunno but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive maybe even bizarre sexual things id kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys huh lem me clarify for you it looks like and i quote a disease to save man from his mind listen rog i knew hobbes was funny you know i told you that but i didnt really know just how funny he was see when he kicked off they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother shes still alive but just barely and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab im hobbess partner right anyway ive been going through his papers and what they add up to is this hobbes was shafting us all me the university the foundations and the councils the private labs everybody we never really knew what it was we were working on hobbes gave us each a few crumbs but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like yeah well im flattered but you wont find any real meat in them its me rollo linsky remember me that you rog but youll think about what i said about working together huh aw he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls school they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge she was twelve dont ask it was craziness believe me they used to come here sometimes dont ask it was women did it to hobbes couldnt handle them that girl that annabelle talk about crazy projects you want to help sick people for the rest of your life god forbid i should talk you out of it rog i got ta talk serious to you really listen ya listening ok i want you to come into this with me to tell the honesttogod truth im lonely all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night he wanted you in anyway thats why we were gon na get together the three of us we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years even with inflation you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher eh lousy dry academic afraid of women lousy but he was always a genius at one thing getting grants could he get grants for crazy projects right its crazy but heres the beauty part ready who cares you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney the bug attacks the bad kidney dissolves it its assimilated by the body and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney i know what youre gon na say youre gon na say its crazy look you got men you got parasites that live in on and around men now why not breed a parasite that does something useful eh why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs why not for example a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney if it takes a little blood for itself so what be generous you can afford it i know youre bored already transplants are yesterdays kishkas right that was my fathers idea private practice he wanted to set me up i couldnt say no but hes dead now and me im still a snoop i got ta do research look at that beautiful stuff lookit it so who changes im still a vd man under the skin rog you know me im a downtoearth kinda guy right not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you rog but its all i got and all i got i share with you go ahead take all you wanthe sounded fine it was very strange he called me at six this morning hobbes called me i thought i was dreaming i havent heard that voice for so long he told me who it was then he said something like meet me at apartment 1208 at noon i want you to go out for lunch with me its time you furthered your education then he laughed and hung up i went back to sleep he called me again at eight to remind me to come oh no i havent seen dr hobbes since i was in medical school he taught me he was my prof in urology and i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology that was it i had no idea hed ever set foot in starliner towers until today i knew the man emil hobbes a doctor and a professor at university i saw the girl around the building but i didnt know her she never came to the clinic no nothing yes sure

act as a sort of executive officer for the week oh very nice king eh i expect youve got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food and how dyou get that by exploiting the workers by
