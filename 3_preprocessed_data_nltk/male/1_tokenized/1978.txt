ittarget zero panchos taco palace well thats their problem ts but but the xk 101 also works on a radio wave control system the problem was to find out the frequency problems problems ive had so many you guessed it youre always one step ahead of me arent you superman yes right there was a police helicopter buzzing the area and transmitting on the same frequency as the garage doors the minute the signal went out zip zip zip and garbage doors still foolishly perhaps i had a theory that eliminates the presidential pushbutton i was doing my homework i know i know i never promised myself a rose garden youre right youre right superman there were wrinkles to iron out but well there is this new rocket the xk 101 maybe i should get help dropped into the sea byebye california hello new west coast

san francisco and here is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land land that happens to be owned by lex luthor enterprises well call me a fool but it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the san andreas fault to do its thing ah it wouldve been so nice yknow at the san andreas fault maybe youve heard of it right right where was i ah yes its just that i spent a fortune on these things and all for naught what a waste no superman of course not you
