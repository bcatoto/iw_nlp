what about her im with you on that and dont you think it needs a good female part increase the romance angle so what wheres it say in this script hes white color is what the part needs man somebody to

why not harry look at me ive been picked up a couple times loan sharking racketeering but i was never convicted im clean once maybe a few times i have not really they always paid what i did till

of it yeah the shylocks the good guy i said i had an idea thats all i dont know about his wanting to meet celebrities thats something new but yeah he comes to la then after that i dont know what happens well since leos name was on the passenger list thats right as a matter of fact or the guy thinks he could get em broken you have to understand the loan sharks in business the same as anybody else he isnt in it to hurt people hes in it to make money you just did karen its a pleasure how you doing you make movies huh come on harry ï½ mesas the worst they might do is get a judgment against you uttering a bad check i cant imagine you want that to happen man in your position i want you to youre not looking at me harry they dont want to deposit yours and have it bounce that annoys them so your dear friend dick allens been calling leaving messages on your machine but you never get back to him i happen to be in vegas on another matter and dick asks me as a favor would i look you up i follow you over here see you in the window with this woman looks a lot like that actress karen flores was in grotesque except shes not blond anymore a markers like a check harry harry lem me give you some advice were there harry you signed markers for a hundred and a half youre over sixty days past due and you havent told anybody what the problem is you know dick allen mesas casino i want you to

these guys can fit you with a rug cover it up for ya thats not bad i think you got it down compass yeah i like it im high up i can see everything you know its the cadillac of minivans buddy at that point basically that has to be it its not that simple you have to be careful theres another guy that comes along a hardon you owe some money to a mob guy wants to take you out anyway on account of a past situation goodlooking too like karen yeah but you havent found him yet the guy took off for las vegas i believe it thats not bad now youre squinting like you need glasses what youre telling me youre tired you wan na go to bed no i want you to look at me the way im looking at you put it in your eyes youre mine asshole without saying it martin look at me pressure im the one applied the pressure martin im not connected to those people anymore not since i walked out of a loanshark operation in miami one were producing im thinking of a movie so you want to know so you dont know what im thinking you mean like we dont give a shit we talk different well you had it down cold watching you in the movie if i didnt know better id have to believe you were a made guy and not acting even the fink part i never met a fink and i hope to god i never do but how you did it must be the way finks act you know marty you were good in the cyclone ill find you leo at eighteen percent okay and dont ask me no more fuckin questions im leaving sit down leo you can keep what you won today thats yours i wouldnt let her if she tried why im here leo basically is to save your ass heres another tip now youre down to threeten in the case you mustve cooled off quite a bit since you got here from when you left vegas with four fifty youve been losing you dont open an account leo you put it in a safe deposit box dip in whenever you want youre here a while whats wrong with a bank i wouldnt think youre that dumb leave over three hundred grand in the closet underneath the extra blanket but i guess you are i know who he works for wheres your phone lem me get this straight you arent responsible for any lost articles like an expensive coat of mine but youre gon na find ray bones coat or get him a new one is that what youre telling me you see a black leather jacket fingertip length like the one pacino wore in serpico you dont you owe me three seventynine couldnt find my toothbrush ill be right back i was scared then not now how long you want me to be scared you bet karen what the fuck are you doing you okay ill go ill go i dont know its not dave its a movie you sure yeah harry you look like you belong in one of your horror movies why not what kinda food they serve at this ivy place anyway what happened i mean i could see myself in movies robert de niro had been in or i could maybe do an al pacino movie play a hardon but i couldnt see myself in ones like say the one where the three guys get stuck with a baby they dont know how to take care of it and you see these big grownup assholes acting cute ï½ you dont mean a movie star more like a character actor oh you thought i was faking yeah theres a girl in it now thats a different story im still working on that one you know getting the visual fabric just right although ive added to it how bout get shorty except that isnt a movie thats real life oh i like him i just think hes short i mean hes a good actor and all but im wondering what it was exactly you saw in marty i dont know im just havin some trouble seeing you two together howd you meet martin anyway depends who pays the guys setting you up you pulled out of their freaks deal so hes paying you back yeah we understand you read the script and like it a lot this things actually accurate i bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on sunset yeah well i like movies i figure if i help harry make one ill find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money that doesnt sound too hard i was in the money business and i get ideas all the time i was never much into it all that bullshit having to do with respect its bad enough having to treat those guys like theyre your heroes having to smile when they make some stupid remark they thinks real funny why does anyone want to be in movies that why you came over here to ask me that sounds fair there a part in it for you not yet i dont like the title or the main guys name what do you think i got you a copy of the script you been here the whole time yeah right listen touch of evils playing near my hotel you wan na go check it out watch charlton heston play a mexican well i got ta have a talk with leo my runaway dry cleaner tell you what ill stop by harrys office and pick up a copy for you harry told me martin loves it he flipped that why harry came over last night see if you could help him get martin in his movie you read harrys new one he says its the best thing hes ever read how come you stopped making movies with harry cotton man can you scream for any movie yeah when you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished when you give us all that look joan crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence not even in mildred pierce ï½ which by the way was a better book than a movie ï½ did crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look like in bride of the mutant when you played the whole end with that torn top ripped nylons work makes the shot more real rough day on the set no no you left the patio door open you got ta stop doin that all the nice things you got around here i wanted to come by apologize for coming into your house like i did last night hey karen how ya doin a couple days ago by people from the airliner come to see his wife tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement the amount based on what he wouldve earned operating the dry cleaners the rest of his life leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys so they were giving him about ten years a hundred and fiftysix somell charge you moren that go as high as six for five on a shortterm loan so three a weeks not too bad thats right three percent well basically this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand plus hes a few weeks behind on the vig the interest you have to pay no it was open it wasnt locked the door from the patio in back i dont think the producer has to do much outside of maybe knowing a writer im thinking about producing im going into the movie business yeah well im in la now howd he know i was in vegas you tell him you gon na start that again youre just like him all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin thing you said dont say nothing and i didnt dont say a fuckin word thats the dumbest thing i ever heard where do you sleep dont worry about it i wont say any more than i have to if that thats what the guy said momo could buy it i could run it for him show some cagney films what im thinkin is maybe momo could buy it theyre closing the granview you know theater down on biscaynec18 i dont know the airport assuming i go along with this when can i have the five hundred leo i dont know youre gon na just give me five hundred grand you serious chili palmer showed you my script boy this town word gets around doesnt it im working on a few things bo im great listen im expecting some people ï½ its a different kind of deal i cant do it thats correct look at me look at me ray ray look at me or else use your fucking imagination hey zimm doesnt ask for dick zimm tells you the way it is or else maybe thats because youve never been outve fuckin miami dipshit maybe its time you got on a plane flew out to la and took a meeting with mr zimm harry zimm the man happens to be a major hollywood player i work for harry zimm alright yeah well trust me im very for real hello you there the three hundred grand a guy named leo devoe scammed off an airline the three hundred grand chili palmer now has in his possession who is this im the one telling you the way it is okay asshole thats who i am now you want your three hundred grand or dont you are you the guy they called ray bones ray barboni maybe i oughta talk to this ray bones character myself see if he wants to invest in my movie who the fuck is momo jesus these fucking names who you have it so how bout it mr selznick do i make my deal with bo or you gon na finally help me out have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him a meeting with who you and karen really i mean at least bos invested in three of my movies cash it happens to be waiting right at this moment in a locker at the airport get the fuck outta my chair yeah chili hi youre fifty feet in the air hows anyone gon na see anything from way up there his shrinks trainer i said id think about it what does that mean in this town nothing i had to tell em something what youre kidding right theyll be looking at you they dont know who you are read it its a grabber what do you get out of this you dont even know these guys just a thought that or im thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow saffrin ï½ doris murrays widow finds out about this martin weir thing and says since murray and i never had any written contract she wants five hundred grand for the script heart attack apparently they brought a couple hookers along the problem is murray he and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the kern a few weeks ago murray never made it back anyway murray has this shrink who also happens to be martins personal trainers shrink murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to martins trainer who reads it to martin while they work out and martin flips loves it shes a rock star every day same time they come down here and have breakfast he has the egg white omelet she has the banana pancakes he sits facing west so he can see his billboard she faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades ride the clouds good picture one of his best parts two time academy award nominee martin weir murray saffrin guy who wrote it did all my grotesque pictures had it in a drawer for twenty years he shows it to me one day tells me hes got a star interested would i produce it its not bad when you know what its about mr lovejoy a blockbuster but quality no mutants or maniacs this ones gon na be my driving miss daisy because i need half a million to buy a script because theyre not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint the first thing theyd do is break my legs these guys my investors they run a limo service came to me originally put money in a few of my pictures and did okay theyre happy so they come in on another deal ï½ this was back a few months ago when i was planning what would be my next picture about this band of killer circus freaks that travel around the country leaving bodies in their wake the characters theres this seven hundredpound fat lady who has a way of seducing guys gets them in her trailer ï½ racketeering that covers a lot of ground doesnt it really you ever been arrested ever shot anybody what does that mean you pack a gun i imagine in your line of work there were times you had to get rough you know say one of your customers stopped paying is that right thats what you do for a living so you dont work for the casino but you work for the casino you wouldnt be talking to me if you were wait a minute youre not the guy are you the dry cleaner the shylock hes barely mentioned and its not believable the wife would get a settlement that fast thats half a movie with holes in it maybe forty minutes of screen time you dont even have a girl a female lead and on top of that theres no one to sympathize with you dont have a good guy thats it thats your movie so he comes to la keep going without him the guys so out of it he doesnt even know its gone its the kind of situation you dont pay you get your legs broken i mean the way you told it to me start at the beginning we see how the story line develops you want to hear this idea its about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand go on tell her karen say hello to chili palmer chili this is karen flores i produce feature motion pictures no tv you mentioned grotesque that happened to be grotesque part ii that karen flores was in she starred in all three of my slime creatures releases you might have seen fuckin basketball game you gon na get rough now threaten me i make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken why do i have to keep looking at you i know what a marker is operator how do i get las vegas information dick allens a very dear friend of mine how far you want to go with this thats what im doing im looking at you did you stop to think what if i had a heart attack have we met i dont recall jesus if i have a heart attack i hope you know what to do what she did not say was i just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin seasick all she cared about was that look all she remembered was that look and why do we remember things in movies because we can see them so mildred says to the cashier i saw the new streisand picture god i just love it at the end when she brushed robert redfords hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other but knew they couldnt be together that look was so romantic you heard me pick n save pick n save shes scared fear is an emotion look kid if you remember anything from your time working with harry zimm let it be the three key words to filmmaking all these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gon na distance us from the emotion of the scene get down here i wan na talk to you come on right now shes gon na talk to martin yeah but whose point of view how honorable of you yeah whatd he have to say so this means youve reconsidered our deal on mr lovejoy i mean morally murray was my friend im not sure how i feel about this doris yeah me too he was a helluva good writer and i would know i discovered him made him what he was yeah lovely last night i watched two guys carjack a camaro down on the corner of argyle there what do you want doris come on in hello doris mans in town two days thinks hes david o fucking selznick we he happens to be loaning me five hundred grand no strings i write any kind of agreement i want oh yeah sure no problem you go on off to bed yeah thats what we need more agents thats where you got the idea hes telling me an idea for a movie its not bad so far sit down have a drink tell karen lets see what she thinks im going anyone skim the pool it needs it you dont what happened to muff yeah well i turned off the set i used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor you know

just entered puberty you know what else you could tell she took care of herself she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom hells yeah she was so clean but then when she got into it she

it out and putting it back in it hurts the first time did what take hell yeah that bitch was bleeding when i first put it in she screamed real loud i saw her bite down on the pillow oh my god so good

there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg the girl must have been taking a break between customers it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and the reason im telling you this epilogue is that i felt that id come full circle yeah id like that you be careful to im going to miss you maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what its like to sleep with you no we already talked about that

everything after that is a blank what do you mean i like women who wear mismatched earrings when giving you money makes me want to come im going to fill it right now i threw them into the garbage which was perhaps immoral but i wanted to come to you clean so to speak i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day ah yes i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck and im not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life we know im a drunk but that seems to be all right with you and i know that youre a hooker i hope you understand that im a person who is totally at ease with this which is not to say that im indifferent or that i dont care i do it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement what im saying is that i hope you understand that i understand no i think youre talking about you ill tell you right now that im in love with you but be that as it may im not here to force my twisted life into your soul sera i hope that you understand how i feel about this first of all youre welcome to my money we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest but i dont think youre talking to me right now about money because its better for me that way ok ive come this far here i am in your house i want you to let me pay the rent for this month all right sera i

youll come to my room for an hour i will give you five hundred dollars thats funny i wonder if youll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me are you working hello i dont know ill find out though the news is not good kid this bit here see there its broken you need a new one howd this happen what did they look like hey brad hows it goingi have given a great deal of thought to that possibility and i am prepared to face it if it should come to war and i presume that is what you are alluding to i would rather have war with the emperor than my own people my dear caulaincourt you have no idea of how compromised my own position has become since tilsit i am blamed by the army for the military disaster at austerlitz and friedland by the nobility for ruining their trade with england by the merchants who must accept french foods at unprofitable prices and by the nation for allowing napoleon to dictate russian policy its a fine thing to establish policies but when they dont work they must be reconsidered granted that you have hurt england but she is still on her feet and to seal off her trade with europe what has it cost you you have had to rule with an iron hand you have turned friends into enemies and even at that the result has only been partly effective you have never been able to stop the extensive cheating smuggling and corruption even of your own officials but i should think the situation in spain alone would give your policy a minus balance you have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas with no victory in sight and you have given england a dangerous foothold on the continent for her armies my dear caulaincourt agreements can endure only when they allow both sides to live napoleon may believe it is necessary to injure england but before that he must realize it is necessary for him to allow his friends to live he can not expect me to tell my nobles they must ruin themselves so that he can bring england to her knees and im afraid that is what it has come to it is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy that one government should assume a right to dictate to another who is upon terms of equality the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce and assuming such a right second it by threatening language in case of noncompliance general kutusov i would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them i think it has merit and is worthy of consideration what do you think napoleon will do proceed i must confess he would look a bit silly fighting his way to moscow and turning right around again well one thing immediately comes to mind if what you are saying is true he would merely withdraw his army from moscow and return to poland for the winter well that is a very interesting idea general kutusov but i can assure you that napoleon is no beginner at this whatever analysis you have done on this situation i am sure that he has gone over the same ground ah yes proceed i will accept your assurance but im afraid i dont see your point yes general kutusov i daresay that this has been considered and discussed at great length napoleon would simply spend the winter in moscow and continue the campaign in the spring another lesser possibility might be to march on st petersburg now although there is some doubt that he has the strength to do this until he refits his army for the sake of your argument let us say that is correct rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything however it doesnt affect what we are talking about please go on you know general kutusov there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by napoleons troops but was organized under the orders of rostopchins secret police proceed general kutusov feel free to say whatever you like i have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation the terms are not established very well general what is it you wish to say i know absolutely nothing of war and i am still totally dependent upon my generals ah my dear napoleon sometimes i feel that i am not really an emperor as you are fascinating tell me leaving aside the question of grand strategy for the moment what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master whatever suggested the idea to you i think its absolutely charming and what a delightful ideai am at your disposal your majesty if he withdraws his army in good order it will be a serious political defeat but if he should be caught on the move with his army in the full grip of winter then it will be a catastrophe if your majesty can prolong his hopes for a treaty by silence be deceit by any means for another month thus postponing his departure then the graves of his army are already dug in the soil of russia i personally am convinced that he will withdraw his army from moscow and attempt to establish himself in poland for the winter in the end he will not allow himself to be cut off from paris but i believe that if he is offered any encouragement by your majesty he will postpone this decision as long as possible he is a gambler and he will trust to his luck if i can presume to go into the emperors mind i believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of moscow when vienna fell there was a peace treaty when berlin fell another treaty that has always been the rules of the game but what is he to do now if no treaty is forth coming he knows that beyond moscow there is nothing and that if he withdraws there remains only a fall into emptiness perhaps it would be even more serious than that your majesty his european confederation is held together by some very slender threads your majesty knows even better than i that austria and prussia are very doubtful allies and the emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him at the first sign of weakness your majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me this is a crucial point and it is a political one which your majesty will be in a far better position to answer than i can napoleon afford to abandon moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you i have no doubt that he has your majesty but does he have any strong moves from which to choose the point is that i dont think napoleon will sit in moscow until the spring i dont think he can afford to forgive me your majesty i am about to make it you have my absolute assurance your majesty that napoleon does not have the strength to attack st petersburg now his army is exhausted and illsupplied and he would be defeated if he attempted that well has your majesty considered what napoleons alternatives might be if you simply chose to ignore his note the point i was trying to make is that i think it is reasonable to say that your majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure if he decided to make peace with the emperor at least at this time i have heard that story but i do not believe it but since the fire a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation the french have become an army of criminals against whom russia must be avenged against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death i believe i am right in saying that before the fire the country had grown weary of the war and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle if i may your majesty i would like to offer a dissenting opinion your majesty i have been advised that you have received a letter from napoleon offering a peace treaty and that you have decided to accept it i hope you will forgive me your majesty for requesting an audience at such a late hour but i have traveled all the way from moscow to see you on a matter which can not waitwill you use the troops she will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway when is she supposed to return of course not but such violence of feeling makes me wonder are you sure that you are not still in love with her but you can do the same thing in six months the next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life you must not act impetuously you cant be serious it would not be good to become another husband out of a moliere farce you know i am only too happy to be of help to you but surely this isnt the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters yes of course i would you know i am not one of your wifes greatest admirers but i certainly know nothing about this no captain charles commanded the cavalry escort and rode outside the carriage in the evenings he always ate at another table they hardly ever spoke to each other no nothing at all no to citizen general bonaparte from one who does not wish to see him dishonored by his wife you should know citizen general that your wife has taken a lover one captain hippolyte charles undated and unsignedwhat do you mean without a doubt to estimate the enemys strength on the battlefield this is something that is only acquired by experience and instinct at jena there were as many opinions about strength of the enemy as there were generals present murat said there were 50000 preparing to attack berthier said there were no more than 25000 about to withdraw berthier sees only what is in the open murat said but dont forget there is a second force hidden in the forest and so it would always go each of them would judge things according to his own ability character and state of mind at the moment you can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back when they are retreating before infantry they merely trudge along head down i shall tell you in the strictest confidence when i was a boy i had a passion for rafts and never had the opportunity to build one im glad you like it ah you approve and what a great pleasure it is indeed to meet you alexander our lives the revolution my career im not insulted fair enough are you proposing to transfer command to me the numbers are not particularly relevant you are not up against soldiers this is a mob and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant properly arranged yes you could have them here by daybreak where are they any cannon cavalry what forces do you have at your disposal are you serious what do you have in mind things are quite serious i should say no thank you im sorry i was at the theater and i didnt receive your note until i returned to my hotel may i come to the map yes with all due respect i do citizen barras i did sir what cowardice what treason joseph has ruined everything how could they all lose their heads they knew i was coming up fast victory was just within grasp come come turn your troops around general belliard and where is joseph who sent my wife and son out of paris but who made this treaty a treaty dont be ridiculous what treaty is this who made it who has been giving orders but where are my wife and son whats become of them where is marmont where is mortier paris has surrendered i dont believe it and who is defending paris and where is the army well belliard whats this what are you doing here where is the enemy i wanted to kiss her but she didnt want to kiss me she slipped away the moment i wanted to take her in my arms she was sitting there and it was as if i had last seen her only the night before she hadnt changed she was still the same still completely devoted to me and she told me we were going to see each other again and never again leave each other she has promised me did you see her i have just had the most vivid dream about josephine who is there i suppose i might blame her for opening her house to the men most responsible to my downfall but how can i she was on her own again she had to look after her own affairs and how can one blame her for having her head turned by the attention of kings ah my poor josephine she was the most alluring most glamorous creature i have ever known a woman in every sense of the word and she had the kindest heart in the world she may have been a liar and a spendthrift but she had something that was irresistible she was a women to her very fingertips how impossible it is to believe that she is dead she should have had larrey or corvisart they might have saved her but why didnt anyone even write to me can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me would you have believed that i should read such news in a newspaper how incredible but did she have the best doctors wasnt there any chance at all to save her josephine dead how unbelievable how impossible it is to believe it she was always physically so strong she was never ill a day in her life let me see it come in come back in an hour oh shit thats not right read it back you may go captain charles you will return to paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to general le clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to madame bonaparte then you have my thanks captain charles for safely escorting madame bonaparte to milan and you may consider your assignment completed did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip was the trip normal in every respect was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied madame bonapartes coach captain charles i believe you are one of general le clercs aidesde camp i believe you are acquainted with my brother joseph bonaparte and my aide major junot i see ahhh no yes as a matter of fact it is no theyre living in nice now i havent been there for three years ajaccio oh where do you come from yes i am a glass of champagne please my god this could be very bad for us very bad indeed but to start a fire like this in five hours how is it possible it would take a carefully organized plan tons of combustibles and hundreds of people impossible i dont believe it i told mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting how did it spread so quickly why didnt you wake me then when did it start my god what a fire my god what time is it you realize of course that thousands of swords have been collected how do you expect me to find yours well then you have a lot of initiative my young friend does your mother know you have come and he sent you to me a sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for that is correct i have met her what is your business with me i am citizen is your mother madame josephine de beauharnais good morning citizen de beauharnais ah well that is the first rule of warfare you must wear longsleeved and longlegged underwear you can never conjure up brilliancies with a cold bottom francis may i ask whether you wear warm winter underwear ill have the fire built up would you like some brandy my dear francis you do seem extremely uncomfortable i see oh will alexander be joining us soon shall we move closer to the fire im sorry that i am unable to offer you better hospitality but this is the only place i have inhabited for the past month ah my dear francis what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last oh yes of course thats a very nice name where are you from only lisette whats your name oh im sorry about that uhhh yes of course if you would like to go there but i have very little money well it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street no i have a room at the hotel de perrin no im only here on leave my regiment is at valence oh i see that must be a great burden then what brings you out on such a night you must be chilled to the bone standing out of doors like this yes it is it must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter good evening mademoiselle only as a last resort what are the councils doing now my dear joseph the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut and while a man may want a slut for his mistress he does not want her for his wife i have no idea her maid said she left two days ago to meet me i can imagine where she is but when she finally does come home she will find her things in the street and my door locked well you shall see are you trying to insult me my mind is made up she will not set foot in my house again i think if i saw her again i might be tempted to strangle her it is time to clarify the situation everything is over between us the comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already i know of no better time the important thing is to find the right lawyer one who will not protract the thing indefinitely in the courts and you junot you would tell me joseph wouldnt you not even the slightest hint of something junot naturally one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but on the other hand it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore what do you think joseph i would like both of you to read this please read it aloud indeed well you may tell dr corvisart i should be entirely satisfied with half her success i didnt mean the things that i said i was angry and i said more than i meant to its me not be safe what on earth are you talking about yes goodbye yes i will be there in five minutes go back to your guests oh now this is absolutely ridiculous if you dont want to be humiliated in front of your guests you will return to the table at once how should i know ask roquier hes cleaning her dress dont be ridiculous and go away im busy working go away im busy yes what is it all right i promise promises mean nothing i dont understand you i will never forgive you i can not promise you that not in the least after all what is adultery only a brief transaction on a couch requiring a few minutes of privacy yes they were the easiest i made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting one had better legs yes no of course no do you expect me to believe that and now were you in love with him no im afraid i never had the pleasure of meeting the general this sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers well im sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be i hope you will forgive me for barging in on you like this madame de beauharnais i called to bring this to your son but i understand from your charming daughter that he is out for the afternoon you are very kind madame de beauharnais do you have some sherry perhaps oh i dont want to put you to any inconvenience yes we introduced ourselves at the door thank you madame de beauharnais you probably dont recall but we met briefly a few months ago at a party at pauls house and was it so widely known that joseph had reason for such concern can you give me a drink please how did you know it was captain charles you mean you heard them making love you could hear them yes how do you know how do you know do you know what youre saying what was there to tell you couldnt face telling me what you wrote it what yes well whatever the hell you wanted to do you are going to tell me everything right now do you understand what the hell is the matter with you you mean about my wife you mean there are some things better left unsaid about josephine look junot you arent going to leave this room until you explain yourself now just a minute you have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why joseph should not give my wife the money which i left for her i cant possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation thats all you can say what are you talking about what are you talking about why not certainly all right thank you please ask him to come here i must have the breakdown now where is berthier well he didnt give it to me and when i ask you to do something for me return the work to me not to berthier why did you give it to him well anyway sorry to call you away from the festivities but where is the breakdown on serviceable vehicles i asked for it yesterday yes im sure hes been too busy chasing his whores to be bothered about my wife god damn it junot wouldnt you think i have enough things on my mind not to waste time on a letter like this to joseph yes yes please sit down i will be with you in a moment i am afraid then i have to ask you both joseph as my brother and junot as my good friend whether or not you know anything about this or whether you saw anything at all during the trip which might make you suspect some truth to it well two nice little swiss boys who are virgins decide they will save up their money and go to a bordello do you know the joke about the two swiss boys who go to a bordello for the first time oh my dearest child you must not worry about anything i will teach you everything that you must know did the emperor or empress give you any instructions of any kind before you left of course my dear how cruel to have been separated from her and how strange it must be for you to be here away from your family and everything you know i only desire what gives you pleasure my dearest i am sure you will enjoy the french countryside you may have anything you wish my sweet and lovely marielouise of course my dear yes i do very much and you my dear wife do you find that i resemble my portraits ah you must forgive me my dearest marielouise i saw it during one of my stays at your palace at schonbrunn yes my dearest marielouise i am your husband good evening ladies you must forgive me my dearest wife but i simply could not wait to see you he will stand by his agreement i know him better than you do that is a matter of opinion alexander and i are friends we have reached an understanding what you are talking about is a gamble on moderation when i gamble i prefer to gamble on force my dear talleyrand none of the kings of europe bear any friendship for france it is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties the only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones i have won on the battlefield we have a treaty with austria i very seriously doubt it i dont think there is any possibility of making peace with england so long as she sees herself safe from invasion that is why we must increase the pressure on her economy with russia in the continental blockade england must collapse more than 40 of her trade is with the continent and russia that is correct yes he has i did not ask her to go to war against me does she deserve anything better monsieur varlac i will count slowly to five and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then i will carry out your execution on the spot monsieur varlac do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech now i order you to come down from the cart no monsieur varlac my warrant is only for you now will you please come down at once you will be taken back to chalon for trial you may save your philosophy for the magistrate monsieur varlac i am only a simple officer in the army and to me what you have done is called murder and his always been called murder by honest men i am looking for monsieur george varlac who resides in the rue de frelicot do you know him monsieur send him in come in let me have it come in send him in come in show him in is he alone what did you say his name was a year ago the whole of europe was marching alongside of us today the whole of europe is marching against us i know alexander his imagination must be struck by some great bold powerful stroke and he will come back to me just as he did at friedland if the french army had been commanded at jena and auerstadt by a tailor the king of prussia would certainly have gained the day duroc i have a bill here for 600000 francs from tirot for building the imperial throne and six decorated armchairs the amount is absurd and at least twice too much from that moment on i foresaw what i might be already i felt the earth flee beneath me as if i were being carried away up to the sky it will scarcely be considered credible perhaps but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together life is a burden for me nothing gives me any pleasure i find only sadness in everything around me it is very difficult because the ways of those with whom i live and probably always

uh we can contain it anymore theres a cancer on the presidency and its growing with every day that im still not confident we can ride through this some people are going to have to go to jail hunts not the only problem haldeman let me use the 350000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments ehrlichman had a role a big role in the ellsberg breakin and im uh i think its time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses uh huh uh i would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years either it goes to mitchell or it comes here hunt has nothing to lose now pardon all of them nobodys going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned executive clemency he says if he doesnt get it right away hes going to blow us out of the water and he means it ever since his wife died in the plane crash hes been over the edge mr president hunt wants more money another hundredandthirty thousand siricas just trying to force one of them to testify but theyre solid the bigger problem i see is this guy who was arrested mccord james mccord he headed up security for the committee to reelect he turns out to be excia howard youll serve no more than two years then hell pardon you to protect his people how the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the president of the united states is it the president would like to know if that was the last payment i was sorry to hear about your wifedick nixon saying im sorry thatll be the day the whole suit of armord fall off christ we created frankenstein with those fucking cubans yeah i figured that out you think this is just about politics sure they did stuff but nothing like this bob forget watergate the breakins the enemies list you got an attempted firebombing at the brookings institution planting mcgovern stuff on the guy that shot wallace trying to slip lsd to jack anderson hes wrong you know about kennedy lbj truman why me whos gon na tell mitchell yeah sullivan thinks henrys leaking hes the one lets not forget theyre just kids they dont vote anyway they had to take her to bellevue maybe shell stay this time executive privilege will make it look like were covering up sir bob and i are gon na have to testify before earvins committee itll never wash pardoning them means were guilty the people the press will go nuts what about england he got pretty burned at chappaquiddick i would personally enjoy doing that sir looks like he talked to joe kraft and to the times told them he was dead set against the bombing that you were unstable claims he has to handle you with kid gloves the countrys loving it hes begging for a meeting chief he wants to go overseas for awhile hes in the dumps sir agnew every time you have him attack the press they give it back to him in spades hes become the most hated man in america sir theres dead american kids here lets say we dont apologize for kent state but maybe we could have a national prayer day i thought the gloves were off excuse me are you talking about recognizing china mr president that would cost us our strongest support is the war worth it is it worth a oneterm presidency because i think right now thats what were looking at i dont know if id go that far sir no sir uh weve never done this before sir how do we pay in hundreds do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills pay him i told him to get out of the country its crazy to start he wants money in hiding he sent liddy to talk to me is it legal i mean has anyone ever done it before well hes photogenic lets try dog bones he left his white house phone number in his hotel room well sir it turns out one of the people implicated is still you see on our white house payroll mccord mitchell mitchells out of his mind now martha just put her head through a plateglass window colson doesnt know about it hes pure as a virgin on this one its just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for they were heading to mcgoverns office later that nightsir i know it well sir you mentioned the bay of pigs several times sooner or later theyre going to want to know what that means theyre going to want to know what was on that gap three days before on the june twentieth tape the one with the eighteenminute gap sir you talked about opening up the whole bay of pigs thing again we cant survive this sir they also have you instructing dean to make the payoff to hunt how do you see this lincoln used it if you resign you can keep your tapes as a private citizen you can fight them for years its the supreme court sir you dont get around it sir the deadline is today your lawyers feel its the smoking gun june twentythird 72 sir the part thats underlined your instructions to haldeman regarding the cia and the fbi im afraid we have another problem mr president hes completely lost touch with reality richardson wont do that hell resign but he works for the attorney general only richardson can fire him who about a dozen congress is considering four articles of impeachment sir can the president afford to ignore a subpoena this could trigger the impeachment theyll go to the supreme court next thats what theyre doing i dont have a pistol youre all set sir just push this button good night mr president no sir you did not youve never been a greater example to the country than you are now sir but but you need to get out more sir and talk to the people no one i know feels close to you may i say something mr president at least mitchell stood up to it mr hoover was a realist sorry its marked also theres june twenty third and this year march twenty first those are the ones so you tell mitchell eight words back in 72 i covered up i was wrong im sorry and the american public wouldve forgiven him but we never opened our mouths john we failed him they went after castro in some crazy way it got turned on kennedy i dont think the p knows what happened but hes afraid to find out its got him shitting peach pits i think he means the kennedy assassination its a code or something the old man plays politics harder than anybody else how so cause he hates you its worse when you get it from someone you trust you do it yeah i knew it i knew it from 69 on and i said it all along didnt i its the fall of the roman empire are you blind and were putting fig leaves on the statues it was her wrist and it was through a plateglass door sir six bodies more light chief helms wants iran or there might be problems all of his old cia buddies are over there making a fortune off the shah put townsend in belgium its available hell give us the documents but i think he should be offered the ambassadorship to iran then hell go without a whimper i was wondering whats such dynamite in this bay of pigs story although it was clearly effective because all of a sudden it was no problem for helms to go to the fbi and try to put a lid on watergate when i met with him he said we could leverage helms weve got to turn the faucet off on this thing its out of control you might burden just me with this in the future you played it perfectly sir cocksucker hes going to think twice before he leaks again beating out the other papers chasing girls why would they who the hells sulzberger anyway their parents are gold traders from eastern europe they buy things they come to jew york city and they buy up things one of the things they buy is the new york times and you know what be proud because theyll never trust you sir because we speak for the average american because theyre not americans we ought to fire his whining ass right now when hes on top you know what itll set the right example for the rest of this administration so that explains his press notices working both sides of the fence jewboy henry always trying to get his nobel prize get laid congratulations boss a great victory the madman theory wasnt so crazy after all sir i believe youre right boss gentlemen i think its about time for us to be getting to the airport the blacks are lost the schwartzes are gone the jews arent the middle henry theyre the far left and his staff come on the copy they were filing from china was great sir what we really must go mr president mr president yeah weve got to get our vice president off the golf course and back there on the college circuit thats top priority dont forget the south sir the west filled with the good football colleges straight kids theres more of em with you than against you not like these mudmutts probably flunking nothing to do except come down here and meet girls henrys out there with them run em over and weve got the economic guys at five the dow lost another 16 points theyre going to want a decision on the budget sir are we holding the line on a balanced budget never complain never explain john sir well one way or the other kent state is not good we have to get out in front of this thing the pr is going to murder us if they didnt tell kennedy about track 2 how did hoover find out you never told him alright but why if kennedy is so clean in all this didnt he cancel track 2 so you wanted castro dead everybody wanted castro dead if hunt and the others are cia why dont we just throw this back in the cias lap let richard helms take the fall jesus before eisenhower approved that i dont understand track 2s chile what that he knew johnny roselli hoover knew a lot of gangsters cue the crowd go to the womans group get the bald guy hes great dick you dont have to make a statement herb covered it for you meanwhile what happens to the country hes treading water dont mention khrushchev he wouldnt do the makeup said it was for queers yes sir ill talk to helms and uh whats our press position on this watergate thing what do i tell ziegler to tell them ill talk to helms oh pat asked if youre coming to the residence for dinner tonight sir how is this national security the only problem with that sir it gets us into obstruction of justice hell need a pretext hell never figure one out for himself yes sir but do you think grayll go for it the bay of pigs that was kennedys screwup how does that threaten us all right thats right and its more a problem for ehrlichman he fixed hunt up with the phony cia ids but what else does hunt have on us you approved that before the fact because i went over it with you but should we talk to trini about paying these guys or maybe chotiner well work on it i say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and thats all there is to it how about a comint classification we put it on the huston plan even the designation is classified but sir youre covered no one here gave orders to break into the damned watergate were clean its only the ellsberg thing and if that comes out its national security but what are we paying him for what do you mean sir our own intelligence capability to fix the leaks we were working on china it was right after the pentagon papers broke they went in to get his psychiatric records yes you approved it sir definitely colson had him trying to break into bremers apartment after bremer shot wallace to plant mcgovern campaign literature he works for colson he used him on the pentagon papers were trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a white house consultant after the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his white house safe apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through mexico the fbis onto it we could have a problem with that well you know sir hes a nut he used to work here with the plumbers and now hes running this watergate caper you remember his plan to firebomb the brookings using cubans as firemen he wanted to buy a damned fire truck magruder thinks hes just nutty enough to go off the reservation we feel the bigger concern is gordon liddy its possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal howard hughes donation to the democrats so the democrats couldnt make an issue of your hughes money it was just a fishing expedition apparently it was their fourth attempt at the dnc evidently to install bugs and photograph documentsblack irishman very moving turning and turning in the widening gyre the falcon can not hear the falconer things fall apart the center can not hold mere anarchy is loosed upon the world and everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned the best lack all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity but it ends so beautifully ominous what rough beast its hours come round at last slouches toward bethlehem to be born yes this country stands at such a juncture you must be familiar with my favorite poem by yeats the second coming flowers are continual reminders of our mortality do you appreciate flowers so president kennedy thought by offering cuba to the russians as a consolation prize this is an extremely dangerous direction mr president terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement is that why you and kissinger are negotiating with the chinese but it has never been the policy of this government to accept that and it is certainly not cia policy it is not my practice to spy on the president doctor kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own my job unpleasant sometimes is to know what others dont want me to know i dont think we can treat this as a formality mr kennedy made a verbal promise to the russians not to invade cuba but you authorized dr kissinger to put this in writing we have recent intelligence that a soviet nuclear submarine has docked at cienfuegos mr castro it will take a little time but ill order a search for your papers though it does raise a disturbing issue and of course i accept im flattered and i want you to know i work for only one president at a time and me current levels may not be sufficient not if i give you all the cards president kennedy threatened to smash the cia into a thousand pieces you could do the same diem trujillo lumumba guatemala cuba its a shame you didnt take similar precautions dick youre referring of course to chairing the special operations group as vice president is there something else thats bothering you mr president im sure you realize this is a very tricky area mr president given our charter and the congressional oversight committees of course weve tried but so far weve come up with nothing that i suppose mister president youre unhappy that we have not implemented your domestic intelligence plan but i didnt choose him as my deputy mr president you did and so shall i arrange some coffee would you general cushman im honored dick that youve come all this way out here to virginia to visit us at lastif things remain as they are hes got the antiwar vote would you walk with me down to the paddock id like to look at the horses for the eighth kennedy never hell fry in hell for what he did to me but nixon doesnt know that which is why im gon na have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot moren we need him not joaquin you idiot nixon did you hear what he said in oregon about me having too much power i want to see him tomorrow clyde hes lying clyde always has thats why nixons always been useful hold still and take your hand off your hip it wont as long as im here no one your property it would prove your case why do you think kissingers taping your calls for history his word against yours and right now hes got the records i always get my man hes obsessed with his own image he wants his nobel peace prize a little too much as the late doctor king proved even an ape can win a prize with good press well you have cia people all over the place helms has seen to that then theres kissingers staff kissinger himself i believe maybe the leaker that was a mistake the white house was full of kennedy people then it still is johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office dont listen to em dont quit remember kennedy bobby and king were against the war where are they now dont give em a goddamn inch on the war president johnson bombed laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing how the hell the times ever got ahold of this ellsberg stuff is a disgrace remember what lenin said in 1917 mr president the power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up the communists have never been closer now is the time to go back to the old themes the ones that made you president let the communists know youre onto them you asked if you could count on my support as long as i can count on yours i know youll win the nomination i know youve been very careful not to thats why im concerned yes your old friend from cuba im trying to spare you an embarrassment johnny roselli is on his way back here how about you are you going to win actually ive just had a bit of luck thank you for coming dick turn this crap off clyde its giving me a headache you may go joaquin it was the poorest lemon ranch in california i can tell you that my father sold it before they found oil on itwell goddamn are you threatening me dick and now i have a federal judge ordering me to bus my kids halfway cross town to go to school with some nigger kids i think mr president youre forgetting who put you where you are i mean i got federal price controls on my oil the ragheads are beating the shit out of me and i got your epa environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass its scratching my ear desis got a point what the hell are we gon na do about the communists right here in our backyard and whose fault is that if wed won in vietnam it looks like to me were gon na lose the war for the first goddamned time and dick goddamn it youre going along with it buying into this kissinger bullshit detente with the communists detente it sounds like two fags dancing well you sure been chock full of surprises so far mister president so whats this about dick that sonofabitch kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow dick were willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him more moneyn you ever dreamed of dick these boys want you to run theyre serious they can deliver the south and they can put texas in your column that wouldve done it in 60 hell kennedys pissed cuba away to the russians and he dont know what the hell hes doing in vietnam these are dangerous times dick especially for business hes all business aint he trini dick we couldve had our own goddamn lawyers handle this deal we brought you down here cause we wanted to talk to you her names sandy i know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a republican and shed do anything for the party well see about that party aint started yet dick got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private thing yknow theres some fellows i want you to meetnot at all this is not going to leak is it uh not really you mean on my knees you have many friends and admirers if they harass you i too will resign and i will tell the world why they will understand sir to be undone by a thirdrate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions history will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries oh god im going to throw up can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved mr nixon it is possible for even a president to go too far i had nothing to do with that sir and i resent any implication i i heard something it sounded idiotic but it must be done your government is paralyzed youll pick up the middle on this one the jews and negros we have to entertain the possibility mr president this can not be breathed especially to our secretary of state that cretin rogers the chinese would never trust us again the only way i emphasize only way to pull this off is in secret exactly yes mr president that is my contention exactly sir that is your historical contribution to lead boldly in an era of limits what i think is theyre cowards their opposition represents the cowardice of the eastern establishment they dont realize as you do mr president that the communists only respect strength and they will only negotiate in good faith if they fear the madman richard nixon well as you know most of my staff have weighed in against this incursion they believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily and will result in crushing criticism domestically but they all got it back again didnt they we should have lunch sometime finally someone whos noticed im a great admirer of yours too mr nixon you are an unusual politician we share a mutual idol six crises sounds like a page from churchill theres no other choice who are you talking to like this you insignificant shit hes turned into a drug fiend he shot people from helicopters in vietnam he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children he sees a shrink in la hes all fucked up now hes trying to be a hero to the liberals if he gets away with it everybody will follow his lead he must be stopped at all costs he was he was we taught a class together at harvard but you know these backstabbing ivy league intellectuals they cant i beg your pardon mr president we are in a revolutionary situation we are under siege black panthers weathermen the state department under rogers is leaking like a sieve and now this insignificant little shit ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy secret mr chairman but your writings have changed the world mr chairman you know mr chairman at harvard i used your writings in my classget off that that leads nowhere you should offer condolences to the families of those kids that was a long time ago youre doing the right thing dick dont let em shake you it wasnt your fault the soldiers were just kids too they panicked you all right this isnt 48 dick theyll never buy it one of the fathers was on the tv saying my child was not a bum and its playing like gangbusters hell hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph four two boys two girls and eight wounded you need her dick in 60 she was worth five six million votes make some money dick prove yourself to the wall street crowd and let goldwater and rockefeller take the fall against kennedy thatll be the day the jewboys a harvard whore with the morals of an eel sells himself to the highest bidder goes to show you all the moolah in the world cant buy you a brain what the hell i love her and shes great in bed its a thing she does she talks at night sorry dick shes a little tipsy hiss was protecting his wife ive always believed that and dick beat the shit out of them the lie it was illegal what he did we can prosecute the new york times go for an injunction for christs sake it soils my mothers memory do you think i want the whole goddamn world to see my mother like this raising a dirty mouth you dont need to check the tape i know what i said never i never said that about jews youre lawyers how can you let this shit go by look this nixon cant say this then tell richardson to fire him they cant impeach me for bombing cambodia the president can bomb anybody he wants yeah well i own the fucking casino well he certainly isnt acting like it well see about that hows the job coming bob no his office i want a very private conversation i dont want to be bugged so lets go where the hell is he good you know how i feel about loyalty im not going to let any of my people go to jail that i promise you the important thing is to keep this away from haldeman and ehrlichman im trusting you to do that john i have complete confidence in you john you dont want to start down that road i remember what whittaker chambers told me back in 48 and he was a man who suffered greatly he said on the road of the informer its always night this is beyond you or even me its the country john its the presidency nobody knows more about this thing than you do john we have nothing to hide but the only flaw in the plan is that theyre not going to believe the truth that is the incredible thing hes right maybe its time to go to the hangout route john a full and thorough investigation weve cooperated with the fbi well cooperate with the senate what do we have to hide i mean who the hell cares about this pennyante shit goldwater put it right he said well for christs sake everybody bugs everybody else we know that its the coverup not the deed thats really bad here if only mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it give them the hors doeuvre and maybe they wont come back for the main course thats the tragedy of all this mitchells going to get it in the neck anyway its time he assumed some responsibility jesus everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types the softheads the average people dont think its much of a crisis for christs sake its not vietnam no ones dying here isnt it ridiculous you say john cut our losses and all the rest but suppose the thing blows and they indict bob and the others jesus youd never recover from that john its better to fight it out instead and not let people testify we could get a million dollars we could get it in cash i know where it could be gotten we could get that how much do you need mitchell mitchells family i like that thats a solution what pay him pay him what he wants son of a bitch then what about this washington post crap woodwind and fernstein so what about those watergate clowns john this fuck siricas crazy thirtyfiveyear sentences there were no weapons right no injuries there was no success its just ridiculous excia theres no such thing as excia john theyre all ivy league establishment is he one of these guys with a beef against us we are covering up for some petty stupid shit there are things i can say when other people say them theyd be lies but when i say them nobody believes me anyway no youre not youre going to claim executive privilege and youre going to stonewall it all the way plead the fifth amendment i dont give a shit they cant force the presidents people to testify i dont know i dont know i just know weve made too many enemies and what am i supposed to do just sit here and watch them coming closer eating their way to the center lyndon bugged so did kennedy fdr cut a deal with lucky luciano christ even ike had a mistress whats so special about me what about lyndon he could make a couple of calls to the hill and shut this whole thing down did anyone talk to him forget it ehrenbergs paid three times that much my point exactly somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper fucking kennedys get away with everything do you see me screwing everything that moves for christs sake i did what the new york times editorial page said we should do i ended the war i got salt i with the russians i opened china so why are these cocksuckers turning on me because they dont like the way i look where i went to school i end the longest war in american history and they keep harping on this chickenshit you know whos behind this dont you its teddy kennedy he drowns a broad in his car and he cant run for president no no hes our only star right now hed go crying straight to the press hed crucify us the sonofabitch get someone from our staff on his ass tap his phones i want to know everyone he talks to no you didnt bob the hardcore four million nixon nuts arent gon na go for it theyll say i sold out to the communists well no place where they speak english that way he can always say he was misquoted yeah good old spiro well better him than me what the hell is he but an insurance policy the soldiers were provoked the students started it for christs sake as long as hes got secret files on everybody i dont want em used against us what about the cia helmss done nothing for us i want to see him we cant touch hoover no i can do this because ive spent my whole career building anti communist credentials i will not go down as the first american president to lose a war going into cambodia bombing hanoi bombing laos it buys us time so we can get out and give the south vietnamese a fighting chance why not oh i suppose you wouldve just let them take over these arent fraternity pranks john its anarchy a revolution we should set up a cuban defense fund on this take care of all of them this is not a joke john its more than that it could be more than that i want hunt paid what the hell are you doing ehrlichman screwing with the cia i dont care how much he wants pay him pay him and wheres hunt now sure lyndon jfk fdr i mean truman cut the shit out of my investigation of hiss back in 48 i like it i like the

hell he was doing at creep this could be trouble these cia guys dont miss a trick this could be a setup no magruder that sonofabitch tests my quaker patience to the breaking point marthas an idiot shell do anything to get johns attention if mitchelld been minding the store instead of that nut martha we wouldnt have that kid magruder runnin some thirdrate burglary was he smoking pot jesus

rusty metallic smell its gone no one will ever find out whats on it i dont know anything about that thats right there is nothing in that statement the president cant explain that was civil war the army and if i stay can we get around this al its totally out of context i was protecting the national security i never intended so victory at sea al henry the pacific theatre christ you can almost feel the waves breaking over the decks i had no knowledge of the coverup until john dean told me about it on march twentyfirst and i did not intend that payment to hunt or anyone else be made an action that will at last once and for all show that what i knew and what i did with regard to the watergate breakin and coverup were just as i have described them to you from the very beginning the hell he will fire him too if you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the justice department fire the sonofabitch and cox fire him a dozen i got half of em elected i still got the south and goldwater and his boys ill take my chances with the senate for what who the fuck does cox think he is i never made a dime from public office im honest my dad died broke you know the sonofabitch went to law school with jack kennedy the last gasp of the establishment they got the hell kicked out of em in the election so now they got ta squeal about watergate cause we were the first real threat to them in years and by god al we would have changed it changed it so they couldnt have changed it back in a hundred years if only let em try i appointed three of those bastards im not giving em my tapes its the presidents personal property i will never give up my tapes to a bunch of kennedyloving harvard democrat cocksuckers these state department jerks bill dont understand you got to electrify people with bold moves bold moves make history like teddy roosevelt tr rushing up san juan hill small event but dramatic people took notice exactly weve got to take the war to them hit em where it hurts right in the nuts more assassinations more killings right al night al you know al men in your profession you give em a pistol and you leave the room damn right and theres still a helluva lotta

we fixed it al and they hate me for it the double dealing bastards they lionize that traitor ellsberg for stealing secrets but they jump all over me cause its nixon theyve always hated nixon i trusted mitchell it was that damn big mouth wife of his yknow al if hoover was alive none of this wouldve happened he wouldve protected the president go on this is june twentieth there can be no whitewash at the white house two wrongs do not make a right i love america god bless america and god bless each and every one of you no for gods sake when does this end townsend gave us 300 grand belgiums not worth more than 100 150 i promised iran to townsend what about the documents he promised how its helms its got to be hell be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain worrying whether someone said something nice about them all shortterm frivolous bullshit ben bradlee worrying about teddy kennedy liking him you know why theyre turning on me theyre not serious about power thats why theyre playing with power theyre forgetting the national interest in the old days people knew how to hold power how to set limits they wouldnt have torn this country apart over a thirdrate burglary all they care about now are their egos looking good at cocktail parties right they dont trust they dont trust america my god my god he talked to the new york times this could be it this could be it four long years the presidency wont protect us bob were beyond politics now but even the presidency isnt enough anymore you know they all miss the point probably our biggest achievement as an administration when its all said and done isnt china or russia its pulling out of vietnam without a right wing revolt let him finish bob dont let it lose us the rightwing vote youre talking too much about black africa henry its killing us with the rednecks wait till the maitais wear off the beast a nineteenyearold kid she understands the nature of the beast she called it a wild animal she understood something its taken me twentyfive fucking years in politics to understand the cia the mafia the wall street bastards she got it bob a nineteenyearold college kid dont forget the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your maker dont forget to be on gods side its okay bob were just rapping my friends and i we actually agree on a lot of things but hell this is nothing compared to venezuela when i was vice president ike sent me down there like a blocking back they threw rocks broke out our windows almost overturned the car read six crises bob boy pat was brave its the parents fault really theres a poison in the upper classes bob theyve had it too soft too many cars too many color tvs get that little fucker great tackle reminds me of my days at whittier most of these kids are useless no a little deficit wont hurt jesus theyre serious whyre we stopping i tell you the soldiers were provoked now stop this pussyfooting around dead kids how the hell did we ever give the democrats a weapon like this i mean if cambodia doesnt work well bomb hanoi if we have to these kids are being manipulated by the communists like chambers and hiss money follow the money they had us bugged christ he had everybody bugged yeah he was gon na support me in 68 but he was also threatening me that was hoover hed give you the carrot but hed make damn sure the stick went right up your ass i didnt want him to get the credit he said id stabbed him in the back called me a twobit grocery clerk from whittier hed just found out about track 2 because he didnt even know about it the cia never told him they just kept it going it was like it had a life of its own like a kind of beast that doesnt even know it exists it just eats people when it doesnt need em anymore two days after the bay of pigs kennedy called me in he reamed my ass because because dick helms knows too much if anyone in this country knows more than i do its hoover and helms you dont fuck with dick helms period and not just hunt frank sturgis all those cubans all of them in the watergate they were involved in track 2 in cuba hunt reported to my military aide but i met with him several times as vice president thats what worries the shit out of me i dont know how much hunt knows or the cubans he didnt veto it i ran the white house side the mob contact was johnny roselli one of the cia guys was that jackass howard hunt the first assassination attempt was in 60 just before the election chile congo guatemala cuba wherevers theres a need for an executive action capability theres a track 2 in cuba track 1 was the bay of pigs invasion track 2 it was our idea we felt the invasion wouldnt work unless we got rid of castro so we asked ourselves who else wants castro dead the mafia the money people so we put together track 2 yeah but roselli wasnt just any gangster he was the gangster who set up track 2 in cuba he wasnt protecting me he was putting me on notice i unlike senator kennedy have a plan to end the war but not for peace at any price but peace with honor no where are they the bastard if id called his shot on cuba i wouldve won he made me look soft an open invitation for mr khrushchev to become involved in latin america we would lose all our friends in latin america i think i think thats the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that helping the cuban exiles who oppose castro would uh not only be a violation of international law it would be when we consider the lineup of the world we find there are 590 million people on our side 800 million on the communist side and 600 million who are neutral the odds are 5 to 3 against us no no not tonight dont let her in here i have too much to do this isnt a moral issue bob we have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gon na go down the tubes the fbi is filled with people who are pissed that i put gray in and not one of their own vietnam china the soviet union when you look at the big picture bob youll see were doing a hell of a lotta good in this world lets not screw it up with some shitass thirdrate burglary i suppose you thought the presidency was above this sort of thing because the president says it is my job is to protect this country from its enemies and its enemies are inside the walls its got nothing to do with justice its national security christ youre right gray makes jerry ford look like mozart just have helms call him helms can scare anybody pat grayll do anything we ask him thats why i appointed him just do what i say bob play it tough thats the way they play it and thats the way were going to play it dont lie to helms and say theres no involvement but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors bizarre without getting into it say the president believes its going to open up the whole bay of pigs thing again tell helms he should call the fbi call pat gray and say that we wish for the sake of the country dont go any further into this hankypanky period weve got to turn off the fbi you just go to the cia bob and tell helms that howard hunt is blackmailing the president tell him that hunt and his cuban friends know too damn much and if he goes public it would be a fiasco for the cia hell know what im talking about uh no one of course is going to see these tapes but bob did i approve the ellsberg thing you know im glad we tape all these conversations because i never approved that breakin at ellsbergs psychiatrist or maybe i approved it after the fact someday weve got to start transcribing the tapes no keep trini out of this chotiners too old and for gods sake keep colson out its time to baptize our young counsel that means dean can never talk about it attorneyclient privilege get to it and dean you stay close on this national security priority restricted and controlled secret national priority security is not strong enough silence howard hunt jesus christ you open up that scab and you uncover a lot of pus well why not fucking hell i did i had nothing to do with that was he in the ellsberg thing on the list of horribles i know what he is and i know what he tracks back to you say he was involved in the plumbers howard hunt is working for the white house no shit this is goddamn disneyland since when whats liddy got that fruitcake what about him contributions it was a legal contribution who the hell authorized this colson their fourth but obrien doesnt even use that office the democratsve moved to miami theres nothing there they did what i dont understand whyd they go into obriens office in the first place no no they make me sick they smell like death i had two brothers die young but let me tell you there are worse things than death there is such a thing as evil i never thought jack was ready for the presidency but i would never never consider his death was awful an awful thing for this country do you ever think of death mr helms cuba would be a small price to pay but if we were able to separate china from russia once and for all we can we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century cia policy the cia has no policy mr helms except what i dictate to you i try to adjust to the world as it is today not as you or i wanted it to be ten years ago mr helms weve lived with communism in cuba for ten years not if you have spies in the white house it isnt your job are you tapping kissinger well well lodge a formal protest yes what yes and you will give general cushman full access firing you mr helms wouldnt do any good of course youll continue as dci youre doing a magnificent job the president would support a reasonable request for an increase i promised the american people peace with honor in southeast asia that could take time two maybe three years in the meantime your agency will continue at current levels of funding im not jack kennedy your agency is secure im interested in the documents that put your people together with the others all of them yes yes it involves some old and forgotten papers things i signed as vice president i want the originals in my office and i dont want copies anywhere else screw congressional oversight i know damn well going back to the 50s this agency reports what it wants and buries what it doesnt want congress to know pay close attention to this then find something and i want these leaks stopped jack fucking anderson the new york times the state department i want to know whos talking to them youre correct im concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests whether they know it or not the fbi is worthless in this area i want your full concentration on this matter robert cushman is a lieutenant general in the marine corps the deputy director of the cia and this is what you use him for my friends call me mister president this damned tie will you help me edgar churchill used to say to me if you want your own history written properly you must write it yourself all right edgar but just

last week talking a bunch of crap pat cant stand her when they know youve got something to protect thats when they fuck you but i wouldnt have if hiss hadnt lied about knowing chambers the documents were old and out of date like these pentagon papers the key thing we proved was that hiss was a liar then people bought it that he was a spy its the lie that gets you you remember john in 48 no one believed alger hiss was a communist except me they loved hiss just like they loved this ellsberg character east coast ivy league he was their kind i was dirt to them nothing you know this kinda thing you got ta be brutal a leak happens the whole damn place should be fired really you do it like the germans in world war ii if they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them theyd line the

on a little lemon ranch in yorba linda but change always comes slowly ive withdrawn more than half the troops im trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years i want an allvolunteer army but its also a question of american credibility our position in the world that man up there lived in similar times he had chaos and civil war and hatred between the races sometimes i go to the lincoln room at the white house and just pray you know the liberals act like idealism belongs to them but its not true my family went republican because lincoln freed the slaves my grandmother was an abolitionist it was quakers who founded whittier my hometown to abolish slavery they were conservative bible folk but they had a powerful sense of right and wrong forty years ago i was looking as you are now for answers but you know ending the war and cleaning up the air and the cities feeding the poor my mother used to feed hobos stopping over at our house none of it is going to satisfy the spiritual hunger we all have finding a meaning to this life right right i used to play a little ball myself at whittier of course they used me as a tackling dummy the orangemen now

the scentlook at that i havent watched the sun set in a million years do you mind i used to think about it i had margaret she wanted kids i thought about moving somewhere far away like europe i could see all of that the first part the getting away but i couldnt see that next part then what so id stop thinking about it and go back to work you understand you mean quit anything when i thought about this that was always there in the back of my head that image of me on my knees crying it wouldnt go away and it would really upset me it was something that i could never get away from but now i feel its okay i feel good do they get down on their knees begging and crying what do other guys do can i ask you something im thinking about moonpies aint that funny i havent had a moonpie since i was ten years old right now im thinking how much id love one i thought that i would be thinking about margaret or work or that id be having these deep profound and depressing thoughts but im not im trying to think really profound thoughts but i cant it seems very funny to me thats what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that thats exactly what i told myself taken thats nice when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them i have been thinking about this for a long while i knew this day was coming i knew someday someone would make the call on me i never thought about anyone that i had whacked what do you call it anyway shit oh well one hundred thousand thats it jesus is that a lot oh yeah i guess we still need to see that price tag like art right you hang some painting that looks like babypuke in your living room only if it costs a bundle i know this may seem like a strange question but can i ask you how much the contract was for not to insult you or anything i know youre a professional but just for me i was just wondering youre pretty famous arent you i think ive heard of you i dont know part of me wanted to but part of me always said whats she going to be able to do i dont know maybe i didnt trust her funny ive never been a talker my wife was always getting on me about that say what you feel tell me whats bothering you you ve got to talk to me i never would though not really hey do you mind if i talk a little i feel like i dont know talking i guess how much fartherbain now ill tell you something it wouldnt fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars youd still be thinking the same thing that youre going to take me and here i am sitting through this knowing its bullshit looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind the only thing i can think is that in just a few minutes im going to take you why dont you tell me you would be what i just said no assassin would say what ive said only a mark would say you understand whats going on it makes sense right did you see how i did that magic wasnt it thats right all right bain pay attention because this is where everything changes yeah you are and you hate it you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isnt that youre sweating your balls off and im not youve got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid all because of me listen to me bain two days ago you contacted your contractor who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell you dont know how they got the information it bothered you but you didnt care how do i know this because ten years ago i was sitting in that chair as scared shitless as you are now it means that im going to tell you things even though i already know that youre not going to listen to a god damned thing i say i knew the same way in ten years youre going to know i know youre going to jump theres a sand barricade up ahead im going to ram this cab into it the cab has an airbag odds are good ill survive but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass odds for you are not so good okay we go around once after those cops youll never be able to come back to cleveland tachlinkov we both know what you were doing its just a shootout then sixty forty at best not my odds how long have you been freelance whats your name we both know its not nicholai okay dont sit back put your seatbelt on the hell i cant its my cab i dont like you so get the hell out get out you think im running you up get out what you think im running you up youre right talking too much again what id love to sit in that jury send that sob right to the chair but they caught the guy i

it coming but all the other people real sad didnt you here all them sirens its been all over the radio some guy shot leevio valli and a bunch of bystanders in the trattoria roma i know just what you mean im pretty beat myself not too good at small talk eh where you from so youre from around here what restaurant where no no problem the airport right take us there no the other hotel paraiso in the city near the plaza del sol no no i said the hotel paraiso good afternoon we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca hi up ahead my boss is in that black limo were not sure which hotel

you fuck cleveland and fuck your contracts hes coming electra get out now yes last night electra im taking off my mike wait until he is on the stairs i waited another four minutes four minutes martin im not normal why when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me honestly no im not sure that i care anymore after her i realized that to survive i had to live without its dangerous to let things become complicated no i tried to stop it i couldnt she was taken someone like me like you a pro yes it can be i didnt want to complicate the situation both why i dont know yes yes im sure you will because ill take it thats a ridiculous move what are you doing did he explain how this happened apparently this doctor was unable to cure you and you were drilling these holes why its always been that way the world has always functioned on two levels no thank you why in the hell would you take that chance jesus if someone had what how do you know theyre not i didnt notice them theyre worth less points why did you trade a bishop for a knight five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids no yes here i am again no i went back to the hotel and waited then he offered me one million dollars to walk away to quit the business he said i couldnt win that no one wins at this game what did he say he wanted what i want now to get out of the business to disappear to some empty greek island i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank he was sitting there very calm waiting for me yes it wasnt planned or premeditated i swear things happened beyond my control i understood i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense i dont know it just happened i was here ten years ago im here now thats it yes ten years ago i sat there in that same hotel window sweat pouring off of me waiting i was i told you he will what ive been thinking about it for a long time five million apiece you get on your plane i get on mine ill be walking out of the bank unarmed youll have the gun and ill drive the car if things go well i dont have to youll already be in a rented car waiting for me thats right he cant the bank has an expensive security system metal detectors and xray machines he wont be able to hell have to go inside hell have to see with his own eyes whether or not i am there if the bank closes he wont know for sure hell come im sure and when he does youll go into the hotel go upstairs and take the gun the sun will be low almost dark the air cool and the bank will almost be closed 545 550 he will put the rifle down he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank it will take the entire day but he will begin to doubt himself he will begin to believe that he missed me that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe then we wait youll be here a restaurant a public place far enough away that he wont notice you but with a good enough view youll be able to see him when he moves inside no it would be amateur a risk hell wait for the prime shot that he knows is coming once im inside hell move to the hotel hell go up the back too much traffic in the front he will be hidden somewhere out here probably somewhere low in the crowd hell stay there until he sees me enter the bank this is the bank this is the hotel in the morning i will enter the bank its too late now okay well have to deal with these i paid a lot for these transmits and receives you should its very important that the body release the energy that builds in it thank you taiwan how was the beach you should knock he wont be looking for you just be careful buy a book keep your sunglasses on okay breakfast i dont know but im sure hes not sleeping yes here you can have the bed the chair is fine for me i dont know maybe ill live on a boat sail to all the places ive never been no no yes work the things i need to get done it helps me to focus it centers me helps me think no i wasnt expecting this i need to think thats where hell be i dont know nothing thinking mexico good do you have a passport i dont it tell it for all i know it could be a machine is that what you wanted to hear something cold blooded something remorseless this is fiction dont you see that this is another reality and the people that come into the world to play this game nobody forces them theyre here they know the rules the stakes the risks do you understand what i am saying no one is innocent including you did it ever bother james bond they become complicated messy no just the first one it was mechanical very precise it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline why my first take the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government so you make more money then once you make the transition you realize you were never working for the government it was always the private sector the vested interests and its the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets yes it didnt matter much to them as long as i disappeared the same reason everyone does you hear your name on cspan and you realize youre a skeleton in someones closet and theyre coming to bury you because you are a women women i dont i dont want to talk about women women no not really they are very good at what they do its very seductive the training the weapons the travel of course i was going to be james bond no they didnt no i graduated from george washington university then i entered the agency training program i was just different some people said that i never thought so languages i was already fluent in nine languages they recruited me when i was in high school more or less the same way everyone does the government the agency yes as soon as you get into this business all you can think about is getting to the top thats all there is until then there is nothing you are nothing because thats how it works thats what its about he was the best he was on top i killed him he was taken we played with a code using the new york times obituaries over three years we played twelve matches i never won he was russian nicholai tachlinkov a legend in the business when i was just starting i admired him when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game its not the same is it because im done no what do you want to know as in daughter of agamemnon just electra rath robert rath he will know everything about you everything i know because ive done it once youve been inside a marks home youre in their head if youre any good youll find the mark in a week and bain is good because i was the best and i couldnt take him right now as we sit here he is tearing through your apartment he is digging through your drawers emptying your closets he will take your telephone and address books your appointment books if you keep a diary he is reading it hell go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat liquor you drink cigarettes you smoke in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them no its the truth i know what you are like me like bain youre a ghost youre not part of the real world you dont have a social security number you dont pay taxes youve probably used ten different names over the last ten years a long time ago something probably happened something illegal and you ran you disappeared and it was easy you think you can do it again but im telling you fading from the law is nothing no matter what you do where you go i swear to you that bain will find you because he took a contract on you hell come for you and hell find you if you walk out that door bain will still come after you this is something that is never going to end you can never work in the business again with this contract because he will find you to survive you have to go into deep hiding and thats going to take money a lot of money if it hadnt been for me you would be dead its simple you need me i need you and we will both need money right we dont have a choice yes the nature of the business you remove your competition yes because he is trying to retire me he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him no they hired bain the contract would have been mine but bain took it from me as he took the previous one another contractor if i still was what i used to be you would not be pointing that at me until a minute ago them yellow pages v for veterinarian there arent that many youre the computer hacker you tell me no stay in the car i want you to understand something if i intended to kill you you would already be dead turn off the engine now you understand why im here i figure that means these are worth ten times that maybe more the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars twenty large thats all im part of the game just like you yeah i work for the government took a guess lucky for you i guessed right nikita she helped me find you get on the expressway one hour per man he has to clean up how many bodies were there thank you yes do you believe that can you tell me about it do you ever think about starting over do you think about their wives or their families but when you finlsh a job afterwards do you think about them do you ever regret things youve done honesty i called because i just want i need to talk youre very good at this arent you why are you working today would you like a drink i prefer it like this yes please come in no yeah yeah why didnt you fade can i ask you a question some everyone handles it differently some are ready some are not go ahead and an rc what are you thinking about right dont know thats how it works everyone who plays the game knows the rules taken average a dime its a common question i hope not its possible why not sure just a little ways up to those trees thank you im sorry but i am waiting for an associate can you hold everything for me until he arrives i have all day

right thing to do yeah it could get better what about us what about me the kids are grown they dont need you anymore you told me that they hardly talk to you then he can move people move for who if

else where try and live a lifetime before friday cram it all in i cant do this honey i had a temper trouble why no i dont mind because i already tried once no i couldnt hes a genius theyre not photographs theyre stories entire histories captured in moments near the church i sat outside and had coffee nobodys asking you to why its okay its not that hot anymore thanks god you know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas have you ever been to that station how about bari how about italy what no you want to eat something are you comfortable do you want to move to the bedroom would you like a beer for your bath how about if i set the table can i help couple want to help oh how is he yeah i now know more about their affair than i remember about my marriage francesca the last thing i want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would even though we know its just i mean its nothing like that but if anybody saw us or the cashier at

shot am i interrupting anything francesca no no forgive me i made a mistake it was an inappropriate thing to ask i already apologized i thought thats what we were doing asking questions my mistake i apologize do you want to leave your husband im a little sick of this american family ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country i guess you think im just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a selfcleaning oven and home movie thats not what youre saying i know its not the same what youre saying is its not as good or its not as normal or proper no but i love them just the same i told you i love other people not everybodys supposed to have a family no i embrace mystery i dont know whats coming and i dont mind no i think i need everyone i love people i want to meet them all i just think there are too many out there saying this is mine or shes mine too many lines have been drawn worlds breaking apart because of mans weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people he wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly im a loner im not a monk never touch the stuff ive got friends all over the world good friends i can see when i want if i want i never got lost for some reason im more at home everywhere than at one place so i decided ill think of myself as some kind of world citizen i belong everywhere and nowhere im kin to everyone and no one in particular see once you get into the habit of not needing anyone its kind of hard to break not at all i wasnt around much so why did i get married well i thought it was a good idea at the time have a home base roots you can get lost moving around so much were not doing anything wrong do you francesca are you all right francesca you sure you wont let me help you with those dishes id appreciate it i like knowing who im stealing from if you cant create art i think the least you can do is recognize it around you dont you think there is so much beauty this of what i call god and fools can nature who wrote that youve got it all right here you know its just as beautiful as any other place ive seen god it knocks me out you want to go back in you get used to it no you rub it on you i have some in the truck dont go away have no fear this shoshone medicine woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root they have safaris for tourists now maybe you can convince your husband this is your home its not nowhere and its not dull im sorry that was youre asking a man if hes too tired to talk about himself you dont get out much do you do you miss it why did you stop and did you well lets just call it a compliment and move on did you love teaching no i wouldnt say that national geographic isnt exactly the hub of artistic inspiration they like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment i dont mind really im not artist id faced that a long time ago its the course of being welladjusted im too normal i dont know if obsessions have reasons i think thats why theyre obsessions im kind of obsessed by it actually nah ive tried my writings too technical i think problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent i better just stick to making pictures we got engaged its still a very sensitive memory for me she starts sniffing me sure men cook we dont all eat bananas with our feet ya know thats very nice of you i dont get many dinner invitations on the job it would be a welcome change thanks you have no reason to feel ashamed you havent said anything you dont have a right to and if anybody tells you different you just send them to me why you uncorked a bottle from what i can tell i got here just in time any later and youd have made the front page running down main street naked smoking camels out of your butt i better go you sure youre all right its been a pleasure sincerely is the dizziness gone feeling better and clean clean whats he like italy to iowa id call that a change i doubt that everything does one of the laws of nature people are always so afraid of change but if you look at it like its something you can count on happening its actually a comfort not many things you can count on for sure must be nice having kids no your kids oh how old as long as it takes i might stay a week no more i dont think wheres your family a little place with cabins the somethingmotor inn i havent checked in yet i thought it was funny sure you want to keep those in the house mind if i smoke sure francesca robert well thank

mechanics they were real signal happy nicky was dreamin his own kind of vegas when i married ginger i knew all the stories but i didnt give a fuck im sam rothstein i said i can change her especially at the casino where he definitely did not work people got the message and nicky being nicky he made his presence known yeah he had a foolproof scheme all right it wasnt very scientific but it worked when he won he collected when he lost he told the bookies to go fuck themselves what were they gon na do muscle nicky nicky was the muscle nick i got ta tell you i got pinched twice for no reason you

we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk and then he hit me with it honey come here ginger somethin huh hey i mean he took care of himself only too well and thats why every badge back home wanted to nail him but nobody had to take care of nicky while i was tryin to figure out why the guy was sayin what he was sayin nicky just hit him no matter how big a guy might be nicky would take him on you beat nicky with fists he comes back with a bat you beat him with a knife he comes back with a gun and you beat him with a gun you better kill him because hell keep comin back and

the camera i hadnt even used it yet i finally made up my mind to return it but granny ethel wasnt there anymore someone else had moved into the apartment and he couldnt tell me where she was okay so this is the story of how it happened okay it was the summer of seventysix back when i first started working for vinnie the summer of the bicentennial a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store hes standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt it was crowded around the counter just then so i didnt see him at first okay you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures well this is the story of how i got my first camera as a matter of fact its the only camera ive ever had are you following me so far ready any time you are you got it take over the register while im gone okay jimmy good of course are you kidding ill tell you what buy me lunch my friend and ill tell you the best christmas story you

dive like this hey man good to see you yeah there she is shes in quite a few from that year she must have been on her way to work yeah thats what id recommend you know how it is tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow time creeps on its petty pace theyre all the same but each one is different from every other one youve got your bright mornings and your dark mornings youve got your summer light and your autumn light youve got your weekdays and your weekends youve got your people in overcoats and galoshes and youve got your people in shorts and tshirts sometimes the same people sometimes different ones and sometimes the different ones become the same and the same ones disappear the earth revolves around the sun and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle i mean youre going too fast youre hardly even looking at the pictures youll never get it if you dont slow down my friend i dont know it just came to me its my corner after all its just one little part of the world but things happen there too just like everywhere else its a record of my little spot its my project what youd call my lifes work thats right more than four thousand pictures of the same place the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight oclock in the morning four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather thats why i can never take a vacation ive got to be in my spot every morning every morning in the same spot at the same time it can be arranged seeing as how ive read your books i dont see why i shouldnt share my pictures with you it would be an honor well lets not

is he from new york so your mother grew up in shanghai i confess better make it charge exactly life just wouldnt be worth living would it i mean its a good story yes i suppose i do i wouldnt say that but at least youve put the camera to good use you made her happy and the camera was stolen anyway its not as if the person you took it from really owned it it was a good deed auggie it was a nice thing you did for her which means that she spent her last christmas with you she probably died did you ever go back to see her every word im all ears so are we ready i have to pee if the waiter comes order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale okay it doesnt have to be true it just has to be good anything good yeah great the problem is i have four days to come up with something and i dont have a single idea you know anything about christmas stories fine or it was until a couple of days ago a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story they want to publish it on christmas day yeah i know but im trying to cut down somebodys worried about my health uh better make it one hi auggie its not a long drive an hour an hour and a half well be back in time for dinner nice machine auggie whered you find it so what did he say when he called or didnt theres no way of knowing is there i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago but she hasnt heard from him either its beginning to get a little scary you havent heard from rashid have you for once in my life i managed to keep my mouth shut theres something to be said for that i suppose no the uh the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull assaultus interruptus it could have been worse if the cops hadnt come i might not be standing here now its written all over you like a neon sign now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better no hes not you are dont be an ass auggie hes trying to make it up to you cant you see that hes got something to tell you auggie the kids sorry auggie im thinking about the kid im sure hed do a good job for you hey auggie ive just been thinking you wouldnt need some help around the store would you some summer help while vinnies gone its his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little this is april lee auggie april say hello to auggie wren its ellen look at her look at my sweet darling slow down huh but theyre all the same what do you mean its kind of overwhelming amazing im not sure i get it though i mean how did you ever come up with the idea to do this this project ive never seen anything like it theyre all the same id like to see your pictures some day a photographer howd you get started so youre not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter i didnt know you took pictures its yours looks like someone forgot a camera do you think i could buy some before you leave are you closed i wouldnt think of it see you around fellas not elizabeth the second elizabeth the first did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh definitely i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth two tins of schimmelpennincks and throw in a lighter while youre at it hey auggie hows it going and hes never tried to get in touch with his son it cant have been easy on him walking around with that on his conscience all these years jesus you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind those are pretty hostile words and and you told your nephew about it has anything happened lately anything unusual or unexpected do you want something to drink a beer a glass of water i was about to get run over by a car and your nephew pulled me back he saved my life i sensed he was in trouble so i offered to put him up for a few days maybe i should have pressed him a little more i dont know i feel pretty stupid about it now i shouldnt have let him go and his parents he doesnt go to the trinity school thats what he said he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventyfourth street as far as i know he went back to his parents look lady thats enough if you dont calm down im going to throw you out do you hear me right now well whatever his name is hes not here anymore he left two days ago and i havent heard from him since you mean rashid im telling you i dont know anyone named thomas thomas whos thomas the damn locks broken again and so you just barge in on strangers is that what you do is that your game how the hell did you get into the building what can i do for you now ask him who his mother was if it doesnt make any difference why not just say it we came here to deliver some clean laundry research i worked the scene right into my story that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible hi kid good im glad thats settled dont worry about it youve got friends now remember just behave yourself and everything will work out youll do it all right you fuck up youve got to undo the damage thats how it works buster if you dont do it im going to throw you out of here do you understand me if you dont pay auggie what you owe him im finished with you im serious all right youve got to square it with auggie since you wont give the money back to the creeper you can use it to make things right with auggie thats probably better anyway better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies heres what youre going to do youre going to open up your backpack take out your bag of money count out five thousand dollars and hand it over to auggie no wonder he was angry cuban cigars you mean he had some hankypanky going with those guys if you dont tell me what happened how do you expect me to know that i need facts not opinions well so you lost the job is that what youre telling me he just up and fired you keep up with that attitude and you wont have a future seventeen is a hell of an age to die is that what you want a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you yeah well you have to be nuts to do what you did if you want my opinion you should give this money back to the creeper just give it back and tell him youre sorry so you robbed the robbers and now the robbers are after you you have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble dont you so how much does it come to good thinking and started to run christ you didnt just see what happened they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up so youre saying it wasnt like that at all here catch is it yours you dont believe me huh look ill show you its all in this book his only copy i mean if you think youre going to die whats more important a good book or a good smoke and so he huffed and he puffed and little by little he smoked his book its 1942 right and hes caught in leningrad during the siege im talking about one of the worst moments in human history five hundred thousand people died in that one place and theres bakhtin holed up in an apartment expecting to be killed any day he has plenty of tobacco but no paper to roll it in so he takes the pages of a manuscript hes been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes absolutely we would be honored uh actually i tend to shy away from that kind of thing pick two or three now that the coffers are open you might as well take advantage of me i mean earlier we could have planned something hey hey happy birthday why didnt you tell me celebrate what for no not the end the beginning his son was just a little boy at the time but the years passed and when he grew up he became a skier too one day last winter he went out by himself for a run down the mountain he gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock just as hes unwrapping his cheese sandwich he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice right there at his feet he bends down to take a closer look and suddenly he feels that hes looking into a mirror that hes looking at himself there he is dead and the body is perfectly intact sealed away in a block of ice like someone preserved in suspended animation he gets down on all fours looks right into the dead mans face and realizes that hes looking at his father all right listen carefully about twentyfive years ago a young man went skiing alone in the alps there was an avalanche the snow swallowed him up and his body was never recovered yeah right the inspiration its a true story anyway so i dont suppose it can hurt can it okay just a little hint i cant tell you the story but ill tell you what gave me the idea for it if i tell you i might not be able to finish it if you dont sleep you dont dream if you dont dream you dont have nightmares once a story gets hold of you its hard to let go besides im making up for lost time i dont know two or three it was pretty late thanks ah coffee smells good fair enough we wouldnt want to get carried away would we now call your aunt em and let her know youre alive maybe or maybe its the other people who dont belong it looks like theyve met in this apartment what makes you think youll be any safer around here its only about a mile away from where you live if they put this creeper in jail then youd be safe why dont you go to the police so thats the something you werent supposed to see huh and i dont huh and what makes you such an authority on what i want or dont want close the door sit down in that chair now listen carefully your aunt em came here a couple of days ago she was sick with worry out of her mind we had an interesting talk about you thomas do you understand what im saying your aunt thinks youre in trouble and so do i tell me about it kid i want to hear all about it right now cut it out will you just cut it out and come back here where the hell do you think youre going where did you get that thing appreciation for what hey its you take good care of yourself okay do you need some money some extra clothes are you going to be all right no hard feelings okay its a small place and i cant get my work done with you around it sounds like our time is up doesnt it and how long did i tell you you could stay how long have you been here it just wont do will it i go two and a half years without being able to write a word and then when i finally get started on something when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again you show up and start breaking everything in my house it just wont do will it if you want to steal it thats your business at least i wont have you around here making noise it might be worth it the world is going to end pretty soon if you dont learn fast look why not make yourself useful im just about out of smokes go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias a little less clumsiness around here would be nice dont you think jesus do you make a lot of noise cant you see im trying to work youll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator cereal in the cupboard coffee on the stove take whatever you want but its time for me to get started in here eightthirty time to wake up hey kid time to wake up rashid up and out i have to work in here the slumber party is over is that what you do draw pictures twelve thirteen years ago actually he died with his sketch pad open on his lap up in the berkshires one weekend drawing a picture of mount greylock no he was a schoolteacher but he liked to dabble its strange though isnt it looking at yourself before you knew who you were my father did believe it or not that little baby is me i listen on the radio i can see the games just fine that way the world is in your head remember i used to have one but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it id just as soon not have one anyway i hate those damn things thats it just the two rooms i didnt expect to see you again suit yourself but if you change your mind heres the address in case youre wondering i like women not little boys and im not offering you a longterm lease just a place to crash for a couple of nights im not people im just me and i do whatever i goddamn want to do got it but your body is in the world isnt it if someone offered you a place to stay you wouldnt necessarily refuse would you except that theres no bed is there and no breakfast either uhhuh one of those cozy bed and breakfast places probably you cant be more specific than that the what then what are you doing in park slope its a little far from home isnt it in manhattan and where do momsie and popsie live thats true but i also owe you something and im not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job what is it family problems money problems you dont have to tell me if you dont want to but i might be able to help cocktail hour is over the young man would like to order a hamburger look kid its okay with me you dont have to play games if you want a hamburger or something go ahead and order it yeah sure and i bet you had lobster last night along with two bottles of champagne you must eat lunch pretty early its only eleven oclock are you sure you dont want some food to go along with it it might help to absorb some of that liquid you dont want to slosh around too much when you stand up good lemonade it is im paul come on at least let me buy you a cup of coffee you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance yes it is its a law of the universe if i let you walk away the moon will spin out of orbit pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years i owe you something no wait you cant just walk off you saved my life i cant believe i did that christ im walking around in a fog i dont mean to pry but i see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back and i begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions arent stowed in there are you in some kind of trouble or what ill take the iced coffee you only live once right do you have real iced coffee or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes yeah give him another one and ill take a cup of coffee while youre at itno wonder its such a screwedup place like me too actually im his father threes a crowd yes im aware of that but i have to keep an eye on mr benjamin wherever he goes to make sure he doesnt get himself into trouble i wouldnt actually call it a party its more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday the guest list is quite restricted so far theres mr benjamin and myself if you accept that would make three of us its my birthday good then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you perhaps i should rephrase the question what i mean to say is are you married or seriously involved with a significant other its coming along at the rate hes going hell have a story finished by the end of the summer what difference does it make to look at the dirty magazines i can see all the naked women i want and it doesnt cost me a cent so i can get my job back what do you care where it comes from its yours no its five thousand dollars open it its for you a little not much sure thing see you later ten oclock tomorrow morning ill be there a job i definitely wouldnt turn down a job definitely id say youve hit the nail on the head seventeen louisa vail remember her cyrus thomas cole my name is thomas jefferson cole thomas thomas thats how we met were members of the international same name club believe it or not there are 846 paul benjamins in america but only two in the new york metropolitan area thats how paul and i got to be such good friends were the only ones who show up at the meetings well you and junior have the same name too dont you hi there little brother its only temporary on a freelance basis you named the kid after yourself huh and have you mended them i dont mean to be nosy but i was wondering what happened to your arm paul paul benjamin five dollars an hour ill take it you know health insurance dental plan paid vacation its not fun being exploited workers have to stand up for their rights is there a benefits package or are you hiring me on a freelance basis whats your offer it was just a thought not a one i just tell it like it is mister if im getting on your nerves though you might want to think about hiring me once you look at it youre going to want to buy it from me thats guaranteed and thats the price five bucks so if youre not willing to spring for it you might as well not bother to look itll just tear you up inside and make you miserable itll cost you five bucks im working on a sketch that old garage of yours is so rundown its kind of interesting just passing through im not going to rob you mister do i look like a thief its a free country isnt it as long as im not trespassing on your property i can stay here till kingdom come i dont know i havent decided yet like it or not cyrus thats my name cole just like yours i was going to tell him but in my own time in my own time its all right i really do know them wow they sure did a job on you fuck you too you white sonofabitch i pay auggie and ive got nothing eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city im not going to do it what are you talking about you cant be serious he was out five thousand bucks he said he kept saying it over and over five thousand bucks down the drain he wouldnt stop five thousand bucks five thousand bucks he was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks i suppose so he never told me about it the water was dripping see i turned it off but it was still dripping and then auggie had to go out and so i left the back room and later on well later on when auggie came back the whole place was flooded his cuban cigars got all messed up you know soaked through just when he was about to sell them to these rich guys in suits it wasnt my fault it was more complicated than that there was a reason that money is my whole future no way theres no way im giving that money back its my money now thats it in a nutshell six thousand dollars five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars to be exact thats just it i didnt think i just did it and started to run yeah i picked it up not exactly i mean there was more to it than i told you yeah it might be i dont know nice try you had me going for a second but no no writer would ever do a thing like that would he his only copy yes an invitation i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute but mr benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us isnt that right mr benjamin excuse me for asking but you arent married are you here we are rembrandts drawings edward hopper van goghs letters i just did its my birthday im seventeen years old as of fortyseven minutes ago and i think i should celebrate having made it this far the end no way the inspiration come on just a little hint thats logical and if you dont sleep you dont need a bed saves you money too so whats this story youre working on anyway just so you dont overdo it you dont want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish you work too hard you know that what time did you get to bed last night one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open lets not get too idealistic thats because we dont belong anywhere you dont fit into your world and i dont fit into mine were the outcasts of the universe it might not be far but its another galaxy black is black and white is white and never the twain shall meet the man has friends and theyre not likely to forgive me if i testify against him youre joking right i mean thats your way of trying to be funny right i just happened to be walking by all of a sudden the creeper and this other guy come running out of this checkcashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands they just about ran smack into me the creeper recognized me and i knew he knew i recognized him if the guy from the checkcashing place hadnt rushed out then screaming bloody murder he would have shot me im telling you the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk but the noise distracted him and when he turned around to see what was happening i took off one more second and i would have been dead i crossed paths with him thats why im trying to stay clear of my neighborhood to make sure i dont run into him again okay okay its all so stupid theres this guy see charles clemm the creeper thats what people call him the kind of guy you dont want to cross paths with you dont really want to know i dont have much time business appointment im seeing my broker at three oclock i bought it twentynine ninetyfive on sale at goldbaums tv and radio well

well uh i think so in the mental hospital uh what no sir uh i didnt hear the i went to the surface and i collected specimens like i was told uh so that a vaccine can be developed that will uh allow mankind to reclaim the surface of the earth to find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus that the virus was taken from philadelphia to san francisco then to new orleans rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi bangkok then peking san francisco new orleans rio de janeiro rome kinshasa karachi bangkok then peking it was released in philadelphia probably on june 14 1995 i got into trouble i got arrested but i still got you a specimen a spider but i didnt have anyplace to put it so i ate it it was the wrong year anyway so i guess it doesnt matter they forced me to take drugs i think it wasim sure it was 2nd street right youre right i have to fix this i was hereas a kid i think you were here too but youlooked just like you look now i know this place this is my dream on the walls they meant the animals when they said we did it i mean in my dream i didnt realize it was you theni woke up and ii thought you were

prank hes hiding in a barn hey turn left here left when i was a kid i identified with that kid down there alone in that pipea hundred feet down doesnt know if theyre going to save him i just have to locate the virus in its original form before it mutates so scientists can come back and study it and find a cure so that those of us who survived can go back to the surface of the earth a secret army the army of the twelve monkeys ive told you about them they spread the virus thats why we have to get to philadelphia i have to find them its my assignment my notes observations clues no i think it

can get to us and now you know we can get to you im offering you the chance to call this off listen to me cocksucker there is no keyser sate if you say his name again i11 kill you right here the answer is no what about redfoot you set up the lineup dont jerk me off we all know what this is you dont work with me if i work with you without knowing who im working for now lets cut the shit whos the man whos your boss tell him well meet we want to meet him who is he you didnt know a little of both better you hear it from me now than somebody else later i shivved him a friend of mine in new york tells me you knew spook hollis were on vacationkeyser soze and who i dont get it what was the money for there was ninetyone million yeah jack what are you doing here nothing something i forget it a rumor is not a rumor that doesnt die i11 find him no matter hell have to know how close we came i know what i wanted to know about keaton someplace else then i want to see him when does he post bail whatthe fuck is that did they charge him with anything what do you mean i cant see him kobayashi i dont think he does not exactly but theres a lot more to his story i want to know why twentyseven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninetyone million dollars worth of dope that wasnt there above all i want to be sure that dean keaton is dead you know damn well what i think if it was a dope deal wheres the dope if it was a hit who called it in this wont be an interrogation just a friendly chat to kill time where are you going to go verbal you gon na run turn states evidence you might never see trial if somebody wants to get you you know theyll get you out there you posted twenty minutes ago captain leo wants you out of here asap unless you turn states is he keyser soze i dont know verbal it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield like you said a spook story but i know keaton and someone out there is pulling strings for you stay here and let us protect you youre not safe on your own why lie about everything else then if hes dead verbal if what you say is true then it wont matter it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york wasnt it tell me the truth he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to customs has been he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead you saw him die right or did you you had to hide when the first police cars showed up you heard the shot just before the fire but you didnt see him die he used all of you to get him on that boat he couldnt get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man the one man that could identify him the kind of man that could have killed edie finneran keaton was keyser soze no verbal you werent friends keaton didnt have friends he saved you because he wanted it that way it was his will i dont buy that reform story for a minute and even if i did i certainly dont believe he would send you to protect her so why why did he want you to live a onetime dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless ratcripple no sir why verbal he left you behind for a reason if you all knew soze could find you anywhere why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat there were no drugs on that boat it was a hit a suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger keyser soze so sate had a few thieves put to it men he knew he could march into certain death but keaton had edie finneran was his extradition advisor she knew who he was and what he knew his own people were selling him to a gang of hungarians most likely the same hungarians that sate all but wiped out back in turkey the money wasnt there for dope the hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger soze for them he was a stool pigeon for the justice department he swore out a statement to federal marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one keyser soze and had intimate knowledge of his business including but not exclusive to drug trafficking and murder but keaton then why didnt you help him you know youve known this whole fucking time give it to me try to reef lying to me now i know everything yes you do you know what im getting at the truth try to tell me you didnt know try to tell me you saw someone kill keaton dont shine me verbal no more stalling you know what im getting at i dont have a minute are you saying it was keyser soze you told the da you didnt know who it was a man in a suit with a slim build tall why didnt you say anything what call then what what happened youre stalling verbal can we just get back to kobayashi this is totally irrelevant so why play into his hands we can protect you if there is a keyser soze hell be looking for you turn states evidence take the stand on this and well hear it out and this is why you never told the da do you believe in him verbal and why leave this out when you talked to the da came from redfoot so this lawyer convince me tell me every last detail 52 scene deleted 52 53 int hospital day 53 kovashs room is now filled with people jack baer stands next to daniel metzheiser a balding man in his forties next to him is doctor plumber across from her is ridgly waiters is he the one that killed keaton not from me you piece of shit there is no immunity from me you atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind every criminal i have put in prison you think i dont know you held out on the da what did you leave out of that testimony i can be on the phone to ruby deemer in ten minutes what lawyer i dont think you do but you say you saw keaton die i think youre covering his ass and hes still out there somewhere i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor my bet is hes using you because youre stupid and you think hes your friend you tell me hes dead so be it i want to make sure hes dead before i go back to new york do i keaton was under indictment a total of seven times when he was on the force in every case witnesses either reversed their testimony to the grand jury or died before they could testify when they t finally did nail him for fraud he spent five years in sing sing he killed three prisoners inside one with a knife in the tailbone while he strangled him to death of course i cant prove this but i cant prove the best part either let me tell you something i know dean keaton ive been investigating him for three years the guy i know is a cold blooded bastard lapd indicted him on three counts of murder before he was kicked off the force so dont sell me the hooker with the heart of gold come on keaton was a cop for four years who else would know the taxi service sure and im supposed to believe that hitting the taxi service wasnt his idea oh come on verbal who do you think youre talking to you really expect me to believe he retired for a woman bullshit he was using her heartwarming really i feel weepy i11 get right to the point im smarter than you i11 find out what i want to know and i11 get it from you whether you like it or not the first thing i learned on the job know what it was how to spot a murderer lets say you arrest three guys for the same killing put them all in jail overnight the next morning whoever is sleeping is your man if youre guilty you know youre caught you get some rest let your guard down you follow i11 be sure to mention that to him i know ruby hes very big on respect likes me very much you know ruby is in attica you know a dealer named ruby deemer verbal oh i know sweet deal you have total immunity according to your statement you are a shortcon operator run of the mill seams everything you do you learned from somebody else i just want to hear your story keaton was a piece of shit he was a corrupt cop verbal i know you liked keaton i know you think he was a good man verbal i know you know something i know youre not telling us everything verbal you know were trying to help youumm a glass of water would be nice i hope i didnt disturb you did you hear what he just said what are we gon na do roger really people say i talk too much hockney was just a bad bastard good with explosives

than it is to buy a cop im not bait no way i post today you think hes you know what its like agent kujan to know youll never be good not good like you you got good all fucked around i mean a stand up guy i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything cause i was a cripple shit i wasnt i didnt know i saw him die i believe hes dead christ it was all keaton we followed him from the beginning i knew him he would never this is all bullshit edie no no no no no no no because he was my friend edie he wanted me to live but how wait youre saying soze sent t us to kill someone i dont i said i never heard of him i never heard of him it was keyser soze agent kujan i mean the devil himself how do you shoot the devil in the back i was afraid okay somehow i was sure it was keyser soze at that point i couldnt bring myself to raise my gun to him i dont understand what youre saying i saw keaton get shot i swear to you i dont know what youre talking about i dont wait a minute i tried believe me but keaton wouldnt have it it was too farfetched for him keaton was a grounded guy an excop to a cop the explanation is never that complicated its always simple theres i wanted to i thought we could make it kobayashi told us where we could find fenster mcmanus was furious he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit that night we got the call give a guy a break huh the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi the quartet was in my file along with every other thing i had done since high school see aliases middle men they knew me better than i did they knew all of us oh but its not if i hadnt been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets i never would have took off for new york i never would have met keaton see that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie illinois gee thanks dave bangup job so far extortion coercion youll pardon me if i ask you to kiss my pucker the same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me theyll bail me out fuck you you think you can catch keyser soze you think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out if he comes up for anything it will be to get rid of me after that my guess is youll never hear from him again wheres your head agent kujan where do you think the pressures coming from keyser soze or whatever you want to call him knows where i am right now hes got the front burner under your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later immunity was just to deal with you assholes i got a whole new problem when i post bail ive got immunity now what can you possibly offer me you tell me agent kujan if i told you the loch ness monster hired me to hit the harbor what would you say i came clean i told it like it happened on the boat so what if i left out how i got there its got so many holes in it the da wouldve told me to blow amnesty out my ass so you got what you wanted out of me big fucking deal keaton always said quoti dont believe in god but im afraid of himquot well i believe in god and the only thing that scares me is keyser soze right kobayashi no but im sure keatons dead there was a lawyer kobayashi the da gave me immunity he wasnt behind anything it was the lawyer i dont know about that you got him wrong you keep trying to lay this whole ride on t keaton it wasnt like that sure he knew but edie had him all turned around r im telling you straight i swear that was all fenster and mcmanus he loved her you wanted to know what happened after the lineup im telling you im not a rat no theres nothing in there about ruby he didnt have my lawyer you know a religious guy named john paul well i do have the

it nothing this is my area of expertise stop me then why dont you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while relax i know what you meant dont worry about it all right i forgot what real coffee tastes like then all we can do is stay mobile and alert hes got to make a move sometime and weve got to be ready when he does welcome to police work you better like coffee sounds to me like a wellï½educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next what does that mean you should practice lying more often youre awful at it where to want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house shes beautiful you know why didnt you tell me you had a daughter told you i wasnt going to go anywhere give me a goddam break im not going to go anywhere alone what we need to do is stop playing
