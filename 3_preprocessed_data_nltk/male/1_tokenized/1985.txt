purely a precaution nay this is a private affair no audience welcome better you watch the dismantling of our enemies and look you see the moat is set aflame i have something far more pleasant awaiting

giant faith to finish last evenings delightful work this is another victory my friends what began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress indeed the best of fun enjoy yourselves i doubt the faeries will admire their beauty come this will be fun to watch no smashing is not required i have a surprise for our tiny invaders raise that hatch always delusion a kind of magic which works against

take great delight in routing the enemy dont trouble yourself beauty indeed i am my dear that makes us a pair my dear princess the human soul is a highly elusive commodity i suggest you spend some hours before the glass contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul your soul why should i

amusing we could flay sweet jack alive as an afterdinner entertainment no now is the time for discipline some lessons in obedience for the future baroness when the times come you wont need to jump ill throw you out myself were both of us damned my beauty to be my bride of course i prefer a plump capon but will happily serve you rats if theyre to your liking i prefer to think more like the sagacious owl i am a creature of darkness i require the shadows solace and the black of night sunlight is abhorrent to me i cover myself completely whenever i venture forth in daylight sunshine is my destroyer i know no more of shame than i do of fear i wear this mask not for concealment but protection i am afraid of nothing were all of us beasts my dear only most are afraid to show it not from me surely

some doors that shouldnt be opened marty said softly without turning around thanks for everything pro it was sure nice of uncle sam to put those yardage markers up for us nope my fathers never clenched a fist in his entire life perfect professor if something does go wrong tonight if i dont get my parents back together when do you think id cease to exist thats just what i needed to hear thats exactly what i said i mean a guy and his mother thats illegal isnt it look im a little worried about this this whole thing with my mother he admitted to the professor i mean i dont know if i can do it i mean hitting on my own mother thats pretty heavy thats all taken care of jesus are you trying to tell me that my mothers got the hots for me but why why would she do that shes supposed to marry the guy but thats impossible george asked her out he had to i saw him walk her home oh god believe me professor running around on a nuclear test site cant be any more dangerous than what ive been doing i brought it with me from 1982 its from my science book look its not a big deal i can fix it all i got ta do is get em together and make sure my old man asks her out i know well it was there oh that i found it in the closet youre talking crazy an atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds professor be serious would you okay professor i get where youre coming from the way i look the way im dressed id stick out like a sore thumb hey look gim me a break all i did was answer the door hows that gon na change history what if you lost your keys you were ringing the doorbell thats just great professor well not exactly professor you see we dont point it at the sun how did you know well professor are you sure you want me to tell you you know changing the course of history and all the power converter oh that expression probably hasnt been invented yet i can get behind i agree with you you didnt professor it was an accident you see what happened yeah a shopping mall you know a shopping mall well theres a mall here now i mean there will be oh yeah jeez this is where you used to live huh you must have been rich marty professor you time machine works it works it sent me back in time im from 1982 professor professor brown sure he agreed quickly all i know is youre throwing away an awful lot of money so what wed be rich sure listen we take the racing results from todays paper professor can this thing send shemp back in time is shemp all right the plutonium thats what i came over here for professor where did you get that stuff a time machine because of that coke now hold on a minute professor hold the phone are you trying to tell me that this all of this here that this is its a a the future what are you talking about wheres shemp then where the hell is he but professor catch you later jeez for a guy with a ton of clocks you sure dont pay much attention to time pro the suns out eight thirty nope the way i figure it doors are made to be opened see you after school that reminds me if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain ive got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house we could be sellin new movies on the street before theyre even in the theater professor brown its almost eight thirty im outta here what happened to dick wilson now whos being stupid the guy who runs this place look maybe id better talk to dick is he around sure a tab uh yeah gim me a tab what did you do to your hair suzy hell no the way my mom carries on about sex you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest you shoulda seen her face when i told her we were gon na stay up all night saturday he added always afraid something is going to happen no way yeah jesus i wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom he just lets himself get pushed around all the time people walk all over him and he never fights back never stands up for himselfrun out of gas youre the only mr lewis in this class if you have something to say say it so the whole class can hear you have a name yes thats my name who are you young man are you supposed to be here unfortunately the way things are going you may get your wish you may see the entire annhiliation of the world if not youll certainly see the destruction of all out natural resources we can already see the air we breathe not to mention the pollution in our rivers and lakes well see all of our oil reserves depleted in fact all of our energy sources yes you people have a lot to look forward to a lot to see all i can say is thats one helluva attitude mr mcfly lets explode a hundred megaton geothermal nuclear device just to see it mr mcfly here wants to nuke it all just so he can see it youd like to see a nuclear holocaustpretty isnt it the orpheum but i told everyone your disappearance was due to a teleportation experiment you were helping me with so dont mention anything about time travel to anyone according to your girlfriend suzy parker you and she were at the movies you went to the restroom and you never came out obviously you stepped through an interdimensional time warp created by the original operation of the time machine you see i never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952 i decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky anyway experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of cuba caught dr felstien fooling around in the bermuda triangle that was back in 64 a car hop in marty weve got a long drive ahead of us 1982 march 18 just like we planned my calculations were absolutely correct thirty years god i can not believe its been thirty years sure it was a long time ago longest ive ever had to wait for the results of an experiment marty i know ive repeatedly asked you not to tell me anything about the future butwell those loud bangs on the tape recorderare they professor brown grinned i guess ill see you in about 30 years were at one and a half miles so youre just a little over a mile from where you want to be wait until minus 3 minutes before you go that should give you plenty of time and it should be close enough to zero hour that they cant do anything to stop you park the truck at 800 and get in the refri the time chamber just be sure the nose of the truck is pointed at the bombthe power converter will do the rest curious very curious you didnt it could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future theoretically it could happen at the moment of your birthor conception actually it could happen at any time its a question to which i hope well never learn the answer theres no way of knowing itll be fine marty youll be fine good luck he stuck his hand out and marty shook it but there was still a question that was nagging at him look marty shes not your mother yet and if you dont go through with this she may never be i know its hard but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant some choices must be made that are difficult nonetheless we must make them besides this may be more than a simple question of your own existence he added the fate of the entire spacetime continuum may rest on your shoulders marty tried to smile at him nobody said anything about hitting her youre just going to take a few liberties with her good professor brown tested the tarp noting in satisfaction that it was secure ill pick you up in front of the school at midnight dont be late were cutting it close as it is weve got a long drive ahead of us in a manner of speaking yes and because of that shes no longer interested in your father apparently what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mothers emotional behavior my guess is that she turned him down your mother wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon and that if you were interested in going to the dance saturday shes available the test is this monday 15 megatons lets see we need 4200 rads youd have to beexactly 800 yards from ground zero you realize that what were going to do could be extremely dangerous where did you get this you better make sure your old man asks her out because if he doesnt they may never have a first date and if they dont have a first date they wont have a second date if they dont have a second date they wont fall in love if they dont fall in love they wont get married and if they dont get married youll never be born you did what curious very curious i dont recall ever seeing it before say where did this guitar come from you forget time travel is instantaneous the time machine would melt but you would have already travelled through time of course its a moot point regardless the only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the armys nevada test site and those tests are kept absolutely top secret i am serious if we could get you the time machine and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast we could send you back to the future an atomic bomb let me put it on a level you can understand you dont belong here you dont know anything about this world you dont know the customs you dont know how to talk how to act you dont even look like you belong here and if you walked out on the street you wouldnt get 100 yards without being arrested then there would be questions and where would we come up with the answers i dont know but i dont want to take any chances now you stay here and dont do anything dont answer the door dont answer the phone dont go outside understand then i would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history dont you understand the fabric of history is very delicate anything you do could have serious consequences i told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time nobodys supposed to see you here what if i was a mailman or a salesman you answered the door 4200 rads that certainly cant be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age we dont just a guess i figured kids would still be drinking coke in 1982 blast it no i suppose youre right you do know the proper chemical formula of course the power converter it works of course it works what chemicals do we use on second thought there may be some things youll have to tell me pardon me no dont tell me i dont want to know the future my knowledge of future events your mere presence here could have devastating effects on the course of history and altering history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear my immediate response is to send you back to your own time youve convinced me that you must be who you say you are no living human has ever seen this machine but why why even in my twilight years would i remotely consider sending someone back in time a mall must have been used to live i do live here uh marty lewis i almost didnt recognize him havent seen him in years he will be simple inebriation is all the young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol something that runs in the family you see hes a second cousin of mine on my mothers side came quite a distance to visit me he added his names lewis ssshhhhh you know me the future marty the future is everything i built this machine to see the future so i am going to send shemp twentyfour hours into the future you can assist me if you like dont you understand the mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events and changing history is a responsibility that i do not wish to bear marty that would alter history a gold mine of course shemp is unaware that anything even happened other than his stool suddenly falling over we had to wait two minutes to catch up to him but for shemp the trip was instantaneous exactly two minutes difference and its still ticking why precisely shemp is right here in this roomtwo minutes from now and at exactly 902pm well catch up to him the appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he you see shemp has just become the worlds first time traveller ive sent shemp into the future two minutes into the future to be exact no marty shemps molecular structure is completely intact get behind the shield im about to release radiation to be traveled through oh right right am or pm oh marty what time did you say it was did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason a 35mm film chain ill see what i can do the power of a million hydrogen bombs and we get twenty four measly volts its not fair ive been working on this power converter since 1949 and youd think in all that time i could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy but no thirty three years of dedication and research and all ive got to show for it is a bootleg video operation shhhhhhhh and then some your ducts ergency procedures be back ervices get to it new washer yer ducts ere please sod you stupid twit vent you sabotage yer nostril avent you mumble tuttle got there have a look ampered with it spoor fix themselves ixed itself ditioning elephoned sirshut up this is a professional relationship how do you think i feel you shit how could you do this to me you stupid bastard bastard shut up well could you stay away from me until this thing blows over sam weve always been close havent we there are no coincidences sam everythings connected all along the line cause and effect thats the beauty of it our job is to trace the connections and reveal them this whole buttletuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside bye bye i do goodbye tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon listen weve also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems as a matter of fact in your block id keep my eyes open if i were you sam bye im sorry sam im afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked sam were proud to have you at information retrieval merry xmas do you know what youre doing er alright for christs sake dont lose it here youd better sign for it we dont make mistakes theres no procedure for that until shes been arrested but ive already put her on the search and detain list right just between as and the security forces youre the only person i can trust of course we went to school together youre my oldest friend what does that mean i dont want to be involved in anything unsavoury well i good point what do you suggest get her out of circulation ive put her on the detention list kindness whats the purpose behind this line of enquiry baffled i dont follow you why barbaras a perfectly good name isnt it look after that suit eh barbara chose it for me she witnessed the tuttle arrest the buttle arrest and since then shes been making wild allegations obviously trying to exploit the situation shes working for somebody and shes not working for us yes im impressed very smart you didnt know as much about this business as you pretended to did you hes a compulsive heating engineer a maverick excentral service repair man with a grudge against society now fortunately were nearly out of the wood i think at least we will be when i get this layton woman under arrest we suspect him of freelance subversion what ive got to do now is pick up tuttle interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle to the same meter reading to the last penny and juggle the books in electrical banking there are some real bastards in this department who dont mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication weve got the upper hand for the moment but theyre waiting for us to slip up and a little slip up like this is just the chance theyre looking for sam there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but buttles heart condition did not appear on tuttles file dont think im dismissing this business sam ive lost a weeks sleep over it already i did not get the wrong man i got the right man the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man i accepted him on trust as the right man was i wrong anyway to add to the confusion he died on us which had he been the right man he wouldnt have done well your a buttle has been confused with t47215 an a tuttle i mean its a joke somebody should be shot for that so b58732 was pulled in by mistake christ you do know it all ok ok lets not fence around this is the situation some idiot somewhere in the building some insect confused two of our clients b58732 and t47215 enough though eh how much do you know please sam were going to have to be open to each other on this one if you make a reputation with this case itll be at my expense you clever bastard i might have guessed you only moved in today and youre already hot on the bloody trail layton oh shit ok come back this afternoon about four oclock if you give me the number of the case ill have the dossier here waiting my tailor well worth the investment what terrific im really glad you dropped by unfortunately i dont have any
