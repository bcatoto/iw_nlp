Where's ganz? He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it. Otherwise, he gets ventilated. You're gonna help us take him. You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls... No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast. I hear you've got visitors. How about it? I said police. Now drop the goddamn gun. You're done. End of story. I don't think you're gonna make it. You lying son of a bitch... Thanks. No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours. That's right. Not my style, Reggie.. It's your money. It'll be here in six months when you get out. There's nothin' to talk about. Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick. You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own... You okay? Partnership? Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine. You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps... Whatever play I maker just back me up. I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it. If she's right, and if you don't screw up. Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend. I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him... Don't worry about it. Naw, you didn't let me down. It was a long shot all the way. We gave 'em a good run at it. I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one. It'll be my good-bye present. I had it impounded. Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam. Yeah. It missed the last four stops. Why? That was quick. Yeah, I see her. Yeah. Guess not. Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job. I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue... Tell me something. Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split? So you took the rest of the night off... Maybe we should pay Luther a visit. We missed. What about Luther? Hello. And goodbye. Where's luther? I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right? You stay with me... Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set. Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you? Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife. What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks. Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy... Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money... I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-... If they don't tell me what I need to know... That ain't philosophy. That's common sense. I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you... Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid? If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd just leave town. You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed. Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs. Musta got some primo bondsman. Guess what? Luther just got in line. You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time. Shit. You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing. ...For three years? Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone. Where's the goddamn car? Yeah. Right. Right, partner. Where's the money? Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points. Not likely, convict. He's after your money. Just tell me about the money. Jesus. How much? They saved your ass, convict. Yeah, right. You want to try again? Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues... Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about. I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ... You? Don't make me laugh. You can't take care of shit. You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt. All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'... This sucks. A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you. Let's go. Come on. There. While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too. Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer. My kind of place. I always liked country boys. I'm gonna enjoy this ... here, I'll even loan you my badge. The bet's off. You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail. And whatever it is, you're part of it. I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once. Why? Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway. I got two problems. Number one, I'm not playin' games. Number two, you got nothin' to bet with. You need five years training to handle a joint like... Bullshit. Attitude and experience get you through... If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up... This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece... Well? Sure. Then we had a fight this morning. Last night. I don't give out the details. Now, where we goin', convict? She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population. She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care? Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut. Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat. We eat when I say we eat. Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning. We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor. He's gotta take that call ... if there is one. What do you think? Want to try it again? Hey, this works pretty good. Just throw me the Goddamn gun. I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun. I'm helpin' you, huh? Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me? I may call you worse than that. I don't give a damn. It happens to be my name. I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack. Luther was part of the gang? Okay, let's get down to it. I did my part and got you out. So now you tell me where we're goin'? Yeah. Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead. And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met. You just don't get it, do your Reggie? There isn't any deal. I own your ass. I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of... We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers... This prison gives out $400 suits? I'll think about it. Bullshit. What's the big deal about you bein' on the street? You're crazy. Yeah? Didn't work out that way. He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie. Yeah, I noticed... Not likely, Reggie. Maybe I just need some help. Try Cates. And let's talk in private, okay? I'm taking my prisoner back to jail. He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with. I didn't have the time. Right. I screwed up. I fucked up. I messed up. Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds. The Indian. I was about 30 yards away. They ran. As fast as they could. Caught a train. I lost them, that's what happened. I'll keep it in mind. Yeah? You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go. Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead... Yeah. It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it. Yeah... Hey, the bastard's got my gun. I want it back. I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun. Are you gonna tell me about police procedure? Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap. The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy? Yeah. Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't you tell me before? What? I got to wait for a call. Bullshit red tape. Nothing came in for me yet? No calls? Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong. So do you...been a long day. One of em's in the slam. I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking. Can we find them? Tell me that's not the same guy. Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this? Who are all these? Billy Bear... Shit. I'll help you out. Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel? When? How? I think I met her. Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her. You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is. I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he? That's what I always say. He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off. Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind... Three more hours... Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works. Usual bullshit. You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this. Let's go, Reggie. Whaddya think? Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend. So what? Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party. How do you know? Nothing. No sign of Ganz. No sign of the Indian. Airport's clean. Train station. Bus station. Docks... Shit... I've been better...Dead end. No Ganz, no Indian. We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours... Don't. We've had a hard night. Hiya, kid. Hi, it's me... Just a second, that's all! Elaine, I gotta put you on hold... The number ... what's the Goddamn number? No, it's I'm just surprised you called. Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business. Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay? Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there. That's right. I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him. Because it's my job. And if you don't get that... I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility. I like to get the job done right. And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit. Bullshit? I'll tell you about bullshit. My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it. It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ... Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ... Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day... Yeah, one of my favorites. Guess people ought to know who I am... Thanks for the coffee. You sure you want me to? That's the way I see it, too. What do you want to know? What difference does it make? I'm the guy in your bed the last three months. I make you feel good. You make me feel good. What the hell else do you want from a guy? Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead. Maybe you ought to buy me one. What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place? I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em. Hey, you know what I really think? I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it. Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you. I guess he got the message... What'd you do? What's wrong with that? That's the way I see it, too. Hey, you're right. This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky? I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you... I don't give a damn about his girl... Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think. Now how's your memory doin'? No, man, I think I'll have a vodka. Vodka. I'll buy ya the best dinner in San Francisco...how'd that be? Then we'll go dancin', okay? Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go. I got this cop waitin' for me... Here you go, baby. I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business. As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party. Here's hoping, baby... No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room... No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there... Yeah, i been waiting three years. Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way. Goodbye. Oh ... You're a schoolteacher... Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust. You interested? No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook? Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me? Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in. You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here. And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash? Wait a minute, Cates. I've been waitin' three years for that. I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand. Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic. Yeah. But I wasn't there for a second. Well, you got to admit we come a long way. Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started. If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in. Hey, there she is... What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit? I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro. Do I get to kiss her too? Yeah, too bad. They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV... It's late, they're closing... Yeah, but we didn't get 'em. Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down. Back to jail in my own car. Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right. Hey, how'd my car get here? Notice something funny about that bus? Luther's on the move... When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go. I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel. All I need is some money for the room. Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ... You sure that's the reason? Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you... They must have set up a meeting for the morning; Luther left an 8 am wake-up and put up the "Don't Disturb" sign. He's trading his girl for the money. All we have to do to grab Ganz is not go blind. Let him get some sleep. He's going to need it. You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call. What about Ganz? Be polite. Say hello. This is Candy. Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers. No way... Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money. That was in style a couple years back, man. We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills? No class... You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job. A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row... If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb. You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile... Doesn't it get... Tiring? Say, do you always work people over like you did Luther? I let women get to me. The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em. Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money. They got nothing to do with helping you make it. I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl. Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world. I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac. Jesus Christ, look at all the dust on my car...why in the hell don't he take it to a car wash? Jesus Christ. That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours. I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door. What? Not really. I figured Ganz was put down for a long time. And I knew Luther would never job me on his own. He's too chickenshit. I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack. You just drove by it. This'll show you how smart I am. I got it parked. You're a real case, you know that, Jack? Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met. In the trunk of a car. A lot better than under a mattress, right? You gonna let me keep any of it? We split 50-50? You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep? Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun. Half a million. I been waiting a long time for some money. One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story. Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time. Maybe I don't like the way you ask. I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night. You wanna leave, man? Let me take care of Ganz all by myself. Wait a minute. Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us. How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and... Must be billy's girl. You made that move, huh? That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control. This place don't seem real popular with the brothers. I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes. I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed. What are you talkin' about? That's never been one of my problems. If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid... Hey, you wanna bet? I been in a lot of bars where a white cop rousted me and some of the brothers. All those clowns ever had going for 'em was a gun and a badge... But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats... Back you up? Now why would I wanna do that? It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it. At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her. She got great tits? You have a good time? Last night, two nights ago, three? Mission District. Gonna find us an Indian. You really do have onoe, huh, Jack... what's her problem besides you? Who'd you call on the phone back at the booking station? Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor. Bullshit ... I ain't moving till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here. If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye. And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music... Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl. Do you know how close I was to getting some trim. And you fucked' it up. If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker? I think you better put him on ice, man. Thank you. I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me. Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man. Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me. Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company. Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead.... Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'. What gang you talkin' about, Jack? Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit. We go to him right away. It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers. Shit. I'm already sorry. No way to start a partnership. Hey, no way. Take off the bracelets or no deal. You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me. Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies... What are you talkin' about? This suit's mine. It cost $900. It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz. I got a lot to protect. I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out. I got to be on the street. Get me outta here. I can deliver Ganz. But you gotta get me outta here first. Ganz is in jail. He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street. You here to write my life story? Sure, anything you want. You got a name, cop? He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you... Hey, two days with him is enough. Hard man to live with. Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years. And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress... Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine. I'll got your money to you. No sweat. Try and take it. Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it? Five. On credit. Don't mess with me. How much? How much? How about some ammo? I'm sure. Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass. Naw, right here's okay. How you doing, man?Maybe. My career is shot. We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down. He tried to disconnect ROK. It gassed him. That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun. Roger. That's my girl. Have you got it straightened out now? Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore. So mentally ill? Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East. I guess this is a first for you. Frank's the best pilot in the program. You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz. Women and the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl. Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run. For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission. Whenever your're ready, Captain. Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn. That's how dry cleaning works. Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians. We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything. Captain Oveur? Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way! That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out. Striker. You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications. You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker. That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand. Now! We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change! I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this. Are you afraid? The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit. That's right -- premature ejection. Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now. That might be the news we've been waiting for. Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something. Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place. You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly. You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program. Not now, Elaine. Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can. Elaine, what's going on? Elaine! There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg. What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face. What word would you use, Elaine? Then you do think I'm insane. Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum. Elaine, we have to go back. Elaine. Not now, Elaine! I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle! Let me by, Elaine. I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight. That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go. No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go. His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says. Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way. Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since. Elaine, what happened to us? Elaine. You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look! It's all here! There's nothing wrong with me! Ask Simon. I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why. It's got to be stopped! That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk. Elaine. I'm sure. That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you. Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. You bought auto insurance, not life insurance. Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people. Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him. No, a bomb. Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge. He's carrying a bomb. Which passenger is Joe Salucci? Don't try to stop me! All right, it's a matter of death. No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death. I have to see Bud Kruger. Pull yourself together! We've got to... Then Elaine was right. Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship? I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown. Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures. Are you on the Mercury mission? Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time. I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time. Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged. People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own. We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore. I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me. I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it. I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go. Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist? Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.That wouldn't be very sporting. One man. He must be good. You underestimate the trap, Mary. What's the point? Where? Pris? I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian. What do you think, Mary? Mr. Sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated. We'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate. He knows what he's doing. Well stocked. We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost. Can't thank you enough, Mr. Sebastian. If you hadn't come along... Nothing the God of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for. I've done some questionable things. I am? But not to last. Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells. What about E.M.S. recombination? Why? I want more life, fucker. Death. Had in mind something a little more radical. Can the maker repair what he makes? It's not an easy thing to meet your maker. Yeah. It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian. Why don't you go home. The name is Batty. Roy Batty. No, you stay here with us. Out last night together. Where are you going, Sebastian? You're our best and only friend. When do you deliver your project? Be better if I could talk to him in person. But he's not an easy man to get to. His company made us. Tyrell could help us, Sebastian. What about your friend, the man who owns this building? If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. You could help us. Not only that, but we have smiliar problems. Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet. We have a lot in common. Like what? Nexus - 6. What, Sebastian? Why are you staring at us? Well, actually If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be... I like a man who stays put. An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you? Okay, but don't kill him. Save a little for everybody. A masterpiece. Very good, Pris. Now show him why. Not if everybody is doing their job here at home. How are things at home? Hello, glad to meet you. When? What's going on down there?Yeah. I got it. Got it. Who. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't like her. She was gonna get away. I was just about to have my dinner. Yeah. Garbage man? What was the cover on the one that got Holden? Where do we start? You got a machine on it yet? What was he after? Six, huh? Number three. Next. Okay, gimme a run-down on the three females. Never mind. Do they have that knowledge? The umbrella. Not if it works. Yes? I think we're through for the night. I know all that. Okay, but... How do I stop one? You start. You equipped for random questions? Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass. Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill. I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me. Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image. If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot. Four years. I don't know. I gotta piss. I like you too. No thanks. Prosit. How long you had these guys? Those cockroaches? Sorry, don't have the time. Prosit. My pleasure. Shot of vodka, please. I'll but you one. What'll you have? It's okay. Forget it. These aren't just... What's that? I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes. No. I got a problem. Yeah. But that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I'm doing okay. Sorry. Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled. Me too. But if you could? Why didn't you go? Never been more sure of anything in my life. They'll change the limit before I change my mind. Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there. Nope. True. Huh huh. Yeah? Meaning? No rust? What shows? Book the good ones for where? You talking about the Opera House on the Main? What's suck night? What night? The girl that doesn't look like that girl. What did she want? Do you recognize any of them? I'd like you to take a look at these pictures. Can I come in? Taffey Lewis? Me. Little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress. You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body. Sorry. Does it eat? It's a good job. It that mother real? For holes. Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here. I'd like to check the dressing room if I could. Like to get this position. Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person? You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way? There's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place. I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists... What? Just wait here. Don't leave here. Don't open the door, don't answer the phone. No, I don't. Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it. Because it's not. Nope. Nobody could stand me that long. What's a long time? You mean a woman? I never felt better. Good for a smart girl to feel stupid. Part of your education. I don't like the noise. Just practice. Practice makes perfect. Never mind the plug, just go through the motions. I don't like people snooping around my stuff. Don't be fooled by appearances. Hmmm? Like? What? It wasn't very good last night, was it? Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes. If they are smart, they take naps. Not too good. I am. Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out. Dead. Me and my dad. You did? You ever take a bath with a man before? Sit. Don't just stand there looking at me. It's not polite. Right. I can imagine. Yeah. So? I work alone. Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no. I've already got more help than I need. Is there anything else? Last question. You're watching an old movie. It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters. Sounds like you speaks from experience. In your opinion. Why not? You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion. You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug. In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl. You're watching T.V. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist. You have a little boy. He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar. Why should I be? It's artificial? A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. If it's a benefit, it's not our problem. I'll see you in a minute. Bad? What's up? You know where I been. I been on vacation. Discreetly. Five, maybe six. She didn't know? Thirteen. If she is, the machine works. One that relies on human interpretation. Where's the subject? Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof. No. Go ahead. Yes. Please. Thanks.Just thought I'd... Thank you. This afternoon. No. I'd be happy to mention it to him. He could? He's not really my friend. I just do a job for him now and then. Dr. Tyrell? I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy. I wish I did, but you're out of my league. Of course not. You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there? Like... Show me something? What generation are you? You're androids. You're just all so... so different. Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to. How about breakfast, I was just going to make some. Well, no, not really. There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor. Day after tomorrow. Soon as I finish the job. It's gotta be right for my customer. You're all so perfect. I keep a lot of provisions right here. Good. Ah, you get hold of your friends? Yes. I couldn't pass the test. My glands. They grow old too fast. Methuselah Syndrome. Twenty. Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now... Beautiful. You look... better. You scared me. I've got stuff. If you wanna go to my place? We sure did. What about friends? Where are your folks? Oh. You want to go home? Mine's J.F. Sebastian. What's your name? How come you were in my truck?I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor. You want to work at Carl's? Arnold. What's happening? I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year. Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor. Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again. Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years! What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and... Don't worry about it. Of course. Later. First door on your left! It's the first door on your left! It's the first door on your left. Go ahead. Just make it quick. Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign? You really want me to put all this stuff back on? I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable. This is how I dress all the time. Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass. I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here. I can't do that. But if you wait a minute... Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too... Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here. All right, then. It's your secret. You're not going to tell me, are you? Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway? See you later. Does Mom know you have company? Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin! Are you still a virgin? I didn't say that. Maybe yes. Maybe no. Why? Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend. Well... it's true. Where did you hear that? I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom. Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent. I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own. Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers? I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson? They're not home yet. I take out the garbage. Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up. Mom says to clean up the pool. Hey-yo. Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over. So who do you have first period? Sis. Yes, sir. He insulted me first. He called me a moron. Okay, Dennis. But they weren't mine. They were left over from the last shift. No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break. Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay. Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it? Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once. There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion. All right, I take it back. How do you know it's mine? We only did it once. Why don't you call me up tonight? What? Now? What's going on? Hello. Look, I'm kind of in a hurry. Oh. Hi. I think I came. Didn't you feel it? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. What? Are you all right? Let's continue. You first. No. Are you crazy? You're a really good kisser. Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend. Come on... I don't know. It's getting pretty late... Well... I know what I look like. I don't know. Do you have any ice tea? You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him? What a guy. Get a ride with somebody. Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi. Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework! Nice to meet you, Stacy. Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too. What do you read? What's the last book you read? So what makes you so sensitive? Sensitive -- what is that? Whatever you say, Rat. You're crazy. Those girls love me. Fine. Get lost. Jesus. I'm sorry. She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway. If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying? No. I don't think so. Not right now. Poor guy. Well, I've gotta be running. I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back? Hey, Mark. Is that you? I'm really pretty busy... Did you go home and get it? Mark. What happened to your date? Yo. You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts... And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss. All right. Pay attention. What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free. Ace the jacket. Hey, Rat. There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall. The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith. That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude. Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens. Okay. Okay. Here's what you do. I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her. I would. Yeah. It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes. Did you get her name? Did you get her number? All right... where did you see her? It's definitely your mama. You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy. You should work for yourself.Aloha, Spicoli. Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by. If you graduate. Well, you'll find out next year. What's that? I think I've made my point with you tonight. Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you. Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty. Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson. Do you want to sit there, Jeff? I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff. Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff? That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in? And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week. Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time. Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing? Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this? You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't? Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy? Yes. Mr. Spicoli? Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here. Really? What class?Easy, mon. There it is! On the ledge? I can't find it, mon! Totally. Something happened to them, mon. Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you. Leave me alone. Leave me alone! Ugh. Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards. Totally. That's me, Merv. Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning. Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it? I don't go at all. School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time. Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains. I've been swimming, Merv. Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great. Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but... Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car. Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us? Just be glad you're all right. You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel. All right. Die, Granada Jocks! It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada! What the fuck is this guy doing? All right. Naw. Any good? Then don't hassle it. I thought he was out of town. Aloha, Mr. Hand! All right! Oh, yeah! You're gonna flunk me?! No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building. Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff? Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question? Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand. I don't know. I guess so. Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand? Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year. Mr... Mr. Hand. You better save some for me, you swine! I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time? Learning about Cuba. Having some food. I don't know. I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever. I couldn't make it in time. Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here! Hey, bud. What's your problem? You just ripped my card in two! That's the name they gave me. Can I come in? This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window. Yeah. I'm registered for this class.The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were! No. It's all about that night, isn't it? I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock. Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it! Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing. You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it? Without me. There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh? Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand. Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh? Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name? There've been some calls. You learn your lines?Are you... are you hungry? Please, Francie... But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied. They'll just catch you again, Francie. Besides, your mother will know. Francie, you know I can't do that. I love you too, Francie. I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... Always. Always. Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that. What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know. I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you. Be careful, Francie. ...Then go. And you think it's worth all this? You really want to go? Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away. I know. No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation. Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous. Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask? You wrote it, didn't you? An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive. I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances. Bye, baby. That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought. Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway. See you next weekend? I'm going back to the hotel. No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism. They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways. I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve... Thank you. It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.All square, Doc. I gotta go now. Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What're you gonna tell 'em? Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow... Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us! Just a little way. Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you? No. I'm not sure. Why do you say that? Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Oh, you... ...ennh. Sure I did, that's why I'm here. How... how ya doin', Farmer? C'mere. I want to talk to you. I hope so, Frances. Right. Except... time has a way of -- I don't know. Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap. You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me. This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it. Where to? I love you too, Frances. Frances, it's me, Harry? Frances! Frances! Anyway... if you need me... Frances, You're crazy. You give up on her? It's not too late to keep going, up to Vancouver? Be the smartest thing. Will you marry me? There's just one more thing. Well... I'll act like I do until I do. Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me? Huh? No. To thoroughbreds. Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground. Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me! What's that? I guess. Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that! Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her. Huh? Whattaya think you're in now? That's right. What? Couple hours from Idaho. We'll cut across to Montana. I've got friends there with a ranch. Forget it, Frances. You're not driving. Evening, gorgeous. You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon. Take a walk, pal. And? You're coming. Hey look, I got some business down in San Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days? Beats me. So you drink, and you fight with a cop...? I'll bet. Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops. Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it. What for? Nice joint. Can you afford it? Think I'll have a glass. Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What's this red stuff? Frances... Calm down, Frances. Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me? I'm serious, Frances. This is important. The chauffeur. He's watching. Don't start, Farmer. Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits. Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy. What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know? Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better. Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything. If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know? Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid. You're telling me. Is that why you did it? Shit. I meant the other way around. Hey that's great, Farmer, just great. Serious, huh? Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard? Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other. For old time's sake. I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability. He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done. Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman. How d'ya like the camouflage? Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die. Eight stories. They killed him. They threw him out that window. Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid. Kaminski. Came to get a tan. How ya doin', Farmer? Well... don't you think it's up to me to... Frances... You don't know what you want. Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it. I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I would have been miserable living his life. He retired to Florida... made a killing in vending machines. You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I thought he was going to die right there. You're not the quiet type, Frances. What? Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it. Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid. You looked okay. Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home? Enh. I just wanted to see how you looked. You think I'd miss it? Harry. I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut. Sure don't talk like you're sixteen. Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy. Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist -- Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you? Yeah, well -- Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here. Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you? Not me. But other people seem to. Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that? I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk. Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!Sedate her. Frances, I'm warning you... Huh? I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end. Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree? Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review. But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe? And you accused her of tampering with your mail. She told me you said, "Mama, you want to kill me." Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you? You're telling me you feel guilty. Really? Any problems? ...I'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother's visit? Is there something else? I'll have someone show you to your room. Stay calm, please. Just a little joke, Miss Farmer. All right. Will you please sit down now? Symington says. And what's that? I see. Please sit down... Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... So it seems. May we be serious for a moment? I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor. Thanks are hardly necessary. I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me. Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade? Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean. What about your husband? Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts. Aren't you ever going back? You sound as if you hate it. Why? Why... yes. Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come! Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood. Only if you were in it. Are you? I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come? Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before! I never said any of that! I wrote. Not every week... There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked. Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please. Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk -- Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya? Great ass. Who's that? Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad. Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back? Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that? Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed. Who gave you this idea? Why? You... in the Navy? Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled. So what're you doing in Seattle? Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla. Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come. I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil. Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful? You should've called! Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit! Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron. Okay, okay. You win. Come back here, kid! You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change. I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia. This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base. Well, that's how long I've been out at sea. Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea... How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it? I'm Byron. Nice to meet you. C'mon. Let's go get your luggage. You, Zack?See you in the fleet, sir! I know. Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir! You're good. What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here. Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up! I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait. Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry. Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out! It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Mayo, are those your friends? Not a fucking chance, asshole! Pity you don't have the character. What is it, the kicks? Is that it? Why? Because you can do it alone? That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines? Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo! No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans. Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me. No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do. Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo? That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you? She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree? Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit. I want your D.O.R. I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise. Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work. How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo? What's your name, boy? Are you laughing at me, dick-brain? What did you call me, Mayo? Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits! Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on! Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer. Where are you from, boy? Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer? Lauder, Sweet Pea! No, sir! You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy? Before that. What did you call me, boy? What did you call me? Hi, son. I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand? Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?! I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet. Louder! Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?Zack, don't! Whatever you say, Mayonnaise. No, sir. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. No, sir. No, sir! No, sir. No. I didn't call you anything before that. I called you Sarge. Pardon? How're you doing, Sarge? Well, I'll be goddamned. What? Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it. I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now. We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed. That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it! No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck. Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise... Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you. ...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette? My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing. No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that. Exactly how late are you, Lynette? How late? By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now? Lynette, I told you already, it won't work. Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay? Or we could do that yeah. What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...? You're sure it's okay? Something tells me you've been here before. I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else? Yeah. He was. He died. Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can. Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived. Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me. Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks! He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter. I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared... No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived. It's mine. But it would still be my kid. That's the point. I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I? She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere. It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it. No, but she's gotta be at least a month late. But it can't wait. Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week. Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist? She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her. My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette. Thanks for covering for me. I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us. What? You've gotta be kidding! I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it? A little. What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you? Yeah. Sure. Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich. Nice, hospitable folks they get around here. I hope she comes. Shhhh... Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet. Could you believe those girls! It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart. Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration? I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me? Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on? That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.Naw. That's over with. What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch? I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it! She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her... That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away. What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important. That what she was... a Norfolk Deb? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I sort of thought so myself. Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends. From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present. I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you. You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief? Nobody. It just came to me. To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away. That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier. I joined the Navy. Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away. Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I. Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown. You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree. Neither have you, pard! Hi, Byron. Thank you, sir! What for? I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place. I ain't never going back to that school, sir. Great. I been calling for four months. Yes, sir. Yes, Sir. Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit! Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself! You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger. Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest. Good morning, girls. Great. You can go in my place. Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down. Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am... Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you. Well, goodbye. I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant. Get on your feet and find out how good, sir. Yes, sir! Aw screw it... It's important, sir! Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private. I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you? But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir. You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through? Yes, sir! That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir! I don't want to do something anybody can do. No, sir! I want to fly jets, sir! I want to fly, sir! Sir, that's not true! I love my country! Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir! I'm doing okay, sir. No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this. No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting. Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines. Not exactly, sir. Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir! No, sir! You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you?? And you turned him down?? What did you tell him about the baby? Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please. That's brilliant. I bet you do! Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him. Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that! Why? I don't know where that is. Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay? Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him. I'm looking for Sid. I know that. I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you? No wonder he was looking at me like that. Your real father was an Officer candidate like me? Your real father? Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him? What would you do differently? No. Is that what you want? Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas. No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you. No, they're for your mom. Hi. Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know? Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family... Hey, will you just leave me alone? Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula. I'm sorry. I can't sit with you. Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down. The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that. My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school. That's no excuse for not going after what you want. What's stopping you? I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually. I'll get it if you want. That was great. I forgot to thank you for breakfast. I've never had a girl. You're better than candy. That's it? What do you want, Paula? What do you really want? Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your -- I'm starving. You stayed after all. Be a friend. Leave. Forget it. Just get out of here. You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed. I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind. There's always a choice. I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked. My kinda group! Me, too. I think we're making some of the locals jealous. You're a very pretty girl, Paula. Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies. Do you go to school? Yeah? Why're you here? I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband. No, and I'm not looking for one either. Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi. My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet. Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack. Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop. Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki? The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it. How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me. Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...? Hey, Sid, thanks. Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation. I can't risk it. I don't notice anyone else complaining. Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five. He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I? I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little? Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out? Sid, what happened? Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility? Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility? Do you know that for sure? Not if she won't even talk about an abortion. So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time. But she expects you to marry her? Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself. Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor? Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit. You should've done what I did. A clean break. I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her. I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan? No problem, but who's Susan? That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from. Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week. Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can. You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away. That isn't true, is it? Naw. Hey, you guys still awake? You okay? She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts. Look at Foley! Can you believe it! 'Nellie's Nymphos!' You told us it would grow out an inch. Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this? Jets. Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end. I've seen better.You're not going in there -- ! Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there! Would you like to tell me whose are the right hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments? Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes -- It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying? But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists? You okay, Jim? How do you feel? I'm taking this bunch to sick bay. Until now. Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario -- It's like the Garden of Eden... How can you think of food at a time like this? But what if they went -- nowhere? Go? Where are we going? This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim. I can spare me... Khan could be down there! There may still be time... you gave as good as you got. Doctors lose patients sometimes. Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd he know about Genesis? I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on? It never rains but when it pours -- What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral? Shore leave, Admiral. I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection. From yourself, Admiral. Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations -- What DO you want? Damn it, why isn't there a girl here? You know this has nothing to do with age. This is about you flying a goddamn computer console when you wanna be out hopping Galaxies. Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the matter? Other people have birthdays. Why're we treating yours like a funeral? Say thank you. Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom. Exactly. Happy birthday. For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens. Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact. More antiques for your collection -- Cheers! Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme. I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring... 'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday... Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship? That's all you have to say?This is just to give us something to do, isn't it? Come on. But we can't just sit here -- ! So are we, it looks like. Go back. I'm going to kill him. Mother, go back! I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military -- Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa. Who -- Does that about do it? Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous. We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the -- Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner? Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak... Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life... How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy. Mainly. And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son. I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry. So am I. My friends were killed, too. But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them. You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life -- That makes two of us. Lieutenant Saavik was right: you never have faced death -- No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected. Are you running away from me? I don't mean to intrude. You can't! We encoded four minutes -- He's on a build up to detonation! It's the Genesis Wave! We appear to have plenty of time. She's making it up! My father was Professor -- I'm Doctor Marcus! We were still there , you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room -- I don't know. Don't you believe it. What are you looking at? Let go -- he can't -- !Young. I feel young, Doctor. Hours instead of days, Saavik; now we have minutes instead of hours -- We each face death every day we're alive, Saavik. And almost got tossed out of the Academy... Now that's what I call a meal. Our first order of business is survival. Do you have anything to eat? I don't know about anyone else, but I'm starved. Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all. Where they went. Saavik. They even killed the galley chief. He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt. I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't. At the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it. You said it yourself; we're talking about a bang that would re-arrange the universe... Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary. As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds. The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor. Ah. Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think. And who am I hiding from? Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and... Bones, I don't want to be lectured. Thank you. Amazing! I don't know what to say -- But I'm allergic to Retlax. Uh -- what are they? Cheers. Bones, these are... charming. I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon -- Twenty-two, eighty-three... Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal -- Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods? They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor. I'm not a drama critic. Physician, heal thyself. Something Spock was trying to tell me. On my birthday. It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known... You did this -- in a day?! Why? Why didn't you tell me? Wait -- Carol! What order? Who's taking Genesis? Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis? Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong? Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong? Is that what you came here to say? I am truly sorry. I'm trying, David. It was just words. Not like this -- no. I haven't faced death, I cheated death. I tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. I know nothing. I didn't expect anything. I suppose I was. I poured a drink. Would you like it? Uh, no... I should be on the bridge. We'll beam aboard and stop it -- How soon -- What? It's a long story. Why didn't you tell me? Where's Dr. Marcus -- I'm Admiral Kirk... KHAN! Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target. Here it comes. Now, Spock. I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission. Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word? ... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using our console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields... Give me some time to recall the data on our computers -- Genesis, what's that? Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew. What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant? Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant: prepare to be boarded. I'm going down to the station. We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power? Scotty -- what's left? We'll be going to warp speed -- An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I. Mr. Scott? We'll beam aboard. Alert transporter room -- Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right. Sensors, Captain? Do it, while we have time. On screen. Scotty, let's have it. Spock? Picture, Mr. Saavik. Try the emergency channels... Uhura. Can't you augment? He'll die -- ! All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power. No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way. He wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago -- and he doesn't care who stands between him and his vengeance. Mr. Scott, the word is given. Every young boy's fancy. I seem to remember it myself. Very well. Mr. Scott, are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise? Midshipman, you're a tiger. Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott? Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well? Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready? Meaning you can't even beam us back? I read you, Captain. Let's have it. Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report, Spock? Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line? Yes, Spock. If he hadn't, we'd be space by now. The word is given: warp speed. Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap? I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room? Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston? And who is this? Spock...! ... the good of the few... Yes -- Spock! He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...? Uhura, patch me in -- Steady as you go... Best speed, Scotty... Scotty, can we make it inside? Uh oh. That's it? What IS working around here? Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott. All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours. Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters? Reliant could be hiding behind that rock. ... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond? And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area... Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again. You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship. It's coming through now, Khan... It's all we've got. At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry... Who the hell are they? Visual! Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers -- WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why ? Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to -- Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ? Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he? Gentlemen, this isn't -- The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now -- The power of creation -- Yes. Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom? How far? Will you accompany me to the bridge? Or the one. I would not presume to debate you. You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions. But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you... That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I. I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure? Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate. To be sure, Captain. Yes, we've been through death and life together. Permission to come aboard, Captain? Home. Hrummm... and where are you off to, now? 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock? Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this. So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot�g�'s first rare -- a trifle emotional -- It had the virtue of never having been tried. They destroyed the simulator room and you with it. I assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating I plan to give your cadets. Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out. You gentleman can remain here, or... Captain Spock, if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can, take the Enterprise to the nearest Star Base and alert Starfleet command when you are out of jamming range. Damn. Alert Starfleet Headquarters. I want to talk with Starfleet Command. Uhura! What's happening? Damn it... In my quarters, Uhura. Kirk here. Yes, well, why don't you show him around and... Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son -- As you were, Mr. Saavik. Dismiss the company. I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer... After you dismiss the company, you will take the watch. Set course for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up survivors. Distance from Reliant... Time! Engine room! What's happening?! Time from my mark... Saavik, get us out, best speed! Mr. Scott, can you get the mains back on line? Cease fire. Look sharp. Descend ten thousand meters. Stand by photon torpedoes. Mr. Saavik, all stop. Hold your course. Look sharp... They just don't want us going in there. Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...' Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all people go by the book. Hello, Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus... I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking. I don't like to lose. I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship. Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant? What's on your mind, Lieutenant? As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities. If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground. Erased... Phasers on stun. Move out. There is no such regulation. We're finding it. Please, please -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative... HURRY. Khan! This is damned peculiar. Yellow alert. Take the test again. We learn by doing, Lieutenant. That was a little joke. You may ask, Lieutenant. There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character. You're bothered by your performance on the Kobayashi Maru . You earned it. Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems. Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently? Then you have something new to think about. Carry on. How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say? A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you? And why not? Very well. Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship? Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners. Captain. Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when ready. Battle stations. Try again. I did nothing -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been -- Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command... Scotty! Mr. Sulu... The shields! Visual. Engage warp engines -- Stop engines. You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer. I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR. I really must thank you.I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically -- But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human. I don't dispute that in the wrong hands -- I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create -- It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix -- I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper. I never took the Kobayashi Maru test -- until now. What do you think of my solution? Or the one. The ship -- out of danger? He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking... Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn. Admiral, they're reducing speed. Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing. I think we can guarantee she'll follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego. She can out-run us and out-gun us. But there is the Mutara Nebula at 153 mark four. Best we could do in two hours. Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power... Be careful, Jim... Aye sir -- A distinct possibility. Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space. Affirmative, Admiral. Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's inside the station. Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent... The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code... The prefix code? Admiral, you can't give him Genesis... Not enough against their shields. Too late -- One thing is certain; we cannot escape on auxiliary power. They knew just where to hit us. Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- ! It would explain a great many things -- What's she doing here? Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn. Logic suggests -- Have they proceeded with their experiments? It literally is Genesis... Carol Marcus -- It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was. Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed. There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond. I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets. That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well. Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material. You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise. Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command. Like all living beings, Admiral each according to his gifts. The ship is yours. Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves... There's a first time for everything, Admiral. Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you. The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you? None of which I am consciously aware -- except, of course, happy birthday -- surely the best of times. I know of your fondness for antiques. She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example. Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality. The Kobayshi Maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment. As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique? I am understandably curious. I exaggerated. Certainly... Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations. Take her out, Mr. Saavik. Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock? Thank you, Mr. Saavik. Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings. We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical. What did you expect, Lieutenant? No power to the weapons system, sir.No. Just let him freeze out there. Why you so damn anxious to let him in here... Hell no. If it did get to him. Wasn't enough time. Generator was out, what...? Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody. Now hold on, you dumb... What's it going to do, being a plant? Let go of me... Now who'd go and do... Cut, bullshit. Been pulled apart. Don't walk behind me. Ain't it there? Cool it, Palmer!! You lying bastard... I said where? Where'd you go?! That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt. Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing? Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana? Cut him loose? Clark, you want me to come in after you?! Clark, you come on out here!! That's impossible, man! Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you! Cut that out, Copper. Nauls? What's taking you?! No. The generator. You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it. Where's the damn flashlight? You fellas okay over there? Who you trying to protect, mutherfucker? I'm telling you this S.O.B. could be one of them. If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours. Then we'll never make it. Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help. The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though. What do you mean "you think so?" Spaceship of some kind. Load of bullshit. We should have jumped his ass. Then kill me. You ain't tying me up. What for? We ain't buying that. You been made, MacReady. We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn. You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are! ... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline... Well, who says I want you going with me?! Gee, thanks! Garry's missing! MacReady! What do we do about those three? But... What we going to do?! Where's the other half? I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it. You buy any of this, Blair? Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh? I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit. You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair? Well, go on. MacReady! The dogs? What's happening?Where these tracks headed? I know. Maybe dinner. Let's load 'em. Screw it, I'm going up anyway. Just listen. And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?! You can't predict this time of year... We'll see... Have you come across Fuchs? What? Know what you mean, Blair. Trust is a tough thing to come by these days. Just trust in the Lord. How you doin', old boy? Look Blair, maybe you're right about this. But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over. I'm unarmed and I'm coming in. Too damn dangerous. If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it. You play chess? Maybe we shouldn't make it. Maybe we shouldn't. Neither will we. Not the only one. I think so. Smart S.O.B. He put it together piece by piece. We'll see. Let's try Clark. Now Copper, you tie Palmer up. Then I'll have to kill you. For your health. Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down. Real tight. ... Ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up... What clothes? What are you doing? ... Where is everybody?! I'm half frostbit! Cut the bullshit... Okay, Sanchez, you come with us. Norris... you stay here... Any of them move -- you fry 'em. And if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren. We all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless. And everybody watch whoever you're with. Real close. Oh, shit! Well, hang on! What? We got morphine, don't we. He's gone already! Do it! Torch them!! How the fuck do I know?! Probably the next meal. That's good enough. I don't know how. Because he's different than we are. Because he's a space guy. What do you want from me, anyway. Go ask Blair. Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back. He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl... ... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing. Look, I'm just guessing... Screw the dogs!! Torch it!! Torch it over there! Childs, you got the torch? You get your ass in here!! Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them. I guess you're okay. And if anyone tries to wake me... I'm a real light sleeper, Childs... Would that test have worked? Well, who's got access to it? It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms. What are you doing? Anything? Hey, Sweden!!! Come on, Copper. So, I don't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down. Little over two hours. Looks good. Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma... ... we'll do you last... Damn if I won't. Could anyone have gotten it from you? Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on? Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles. I am going after them. Don't let up, Childs! What are you talking?! He's had two months training in those choppers! Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things. Tie up Clark, too. I'm sure a lot of you already know. Sanchez, you and Palmer search the inside... We going to make it? Sanchez...? Hey, who... Move it, Palmer. Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight. Then get a move on. Childs, come with me. What's... What is it out there, anyway? Forty-five knots? I'm going to blow the generator when you get back. He'll have to come for us -- or freeze. It'll come. It needs us. We're the only thing left to imitate... Give me a hand. If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks... We've got to find Fuchs. When we find him -- we kill him. Screw the flashlights. Where the hell were you? Can you think of any other tests? Then we go after him. Calm down and get in your position. The generator! Chance we got to take. We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged. You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen. Forget about Childs. He's over. Anyplace but here. Everything that's been missing. Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say. We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood. ... Hey, somebody! Open up, it's me, MacReady... ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped. Been crawling around like a seal out here... Couldn't be possible. Must have weighted a ton and a half... Just keep looking. Well, let's get down there. Yeah! What's happened?! Right. Half of us awake at all times. Who else could have used that key? No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft? So what do you make of it? What for? We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?He's so close. Maybe our best chance to blow him away. Let's open it. Now... Let's open it. Could have been anytime. Anywhere. Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits. We got to burn 'em. Don't get near 'em. The plants! They're alive. Those things can imitate anything... Childs!! Somebody broke in. Auxiliary light cables...? Been cut. What? Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One? Happens all the time, man. They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America. I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew... He's dead. What kind of test? I ain't going with Sanchez. Hope so. Another ten, fifteen minutes. What I don't get is... Somebody definitely messed with it. Mac, where the hell is that pump!! No it ain't there. Would I be asking if it were there? And that was enough? How's that Thing get to the dogs? I though we stopped it in time. Oh, I got you. Not too long. Blair. He's gone berserk. Four!And why, please tell us, would you think that? ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that? You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years? You've just said you signed it. You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago. 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is? You know these doctors could have settled out of court. They wanted a trial. They wanted to clear their names. Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago. Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie. When were you lying? And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today. Isn't that right? Isn't that right...? Now. I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed...? ...sworn before God you would tell the truth? Just now... In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right? You would not...? Yes. It is a crime. A serious crime. You are aware of the penalties for perjury...? Objection. Do you, indeed. I'll bet you do. Fine. Fine. We'll save the court the time. We will admit the Doctor as an 'expert witness,' fine. Yes, we've heard that. Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians? Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there? Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine? How old are you? ...of Anesthesiology? What book is that? How is that? Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...? Orthopedics? Neurology? ...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine? Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor? Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today? Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye. Is that correct? And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives. Your Honor...! Your Honor... We've touched on this, his own witness has said... Objection, we've... Ed Concannon. Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here. Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form. No further questions. Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right... Nothing further, your Honor. My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way. Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars. Tell us. You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right? ...to save her and to save the baby. Is that... ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form... ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did? And what did your team do... ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen. She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Tell me one? Why wasn't she getting oxygen...? 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...? What did these people do when her heart stopped? Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you? Anything special about the case? You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not? Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right? You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy... Say it. Whatever the 'truth' is, let's hear that. You were her doctor. Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.I did. I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done. Sir. Yes. When a thing is wrong... as in this case, I am available. I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified. I'm on the staff of... I am seventy-four years old. 'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes. Meth... Methodology and Technique... Through, through his book. I know of him. I'm just an M.D. No. No. No, I am not. It's quite common in New York State... Just as you are, Sir... That is correct. I was engaged to render an opinion. You sure you don't want me to stay on. You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth. I'm afraid that's not true. Will you want me to stay on till Monday? I didn't do too well for you. It's my opinion it took him much longer. Nine... ten minutes. There's too much brain damage. Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today. There's nothing they can do to me. ...What difference would... ...I made a reservation at... From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case... That's what I'd planned to... It was good of you to meet... I... um... I... given the limits of your question, that's correct. I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.' Well... 'Code Blue'... Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I... ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I... I am on the staff of... I am seventy-four years old. ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart. Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she... They gave her the wrong anesthetic.My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know... Yes! ...We did everything we could... Yes. Well, we... That's right. She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask... Well, many reasons, actually... It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins... We went to Code Blue... Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse... Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr. Marx, of course... Thank you. When Debby... When she... Yes. Yes. ...I was one of a group of... I was her doctor. Yes. No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient... Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case. She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission. Yes. I. Yes. It is. Yes. I wrote it.Ah. How did they treat you? Good. You ever been inside a hospital? Abrams. Yes. How are you today? Mr. Abraham... That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money. I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money. I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser. I can't do it. I can't take it. And no one will know the truth. Yes. It would be. Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy. You thought it was just. How did you settle on the amount? They want to settle. It means a lot of money. That's the call that I'm waiting for. This is going to drive the ante up. To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify? You know what that would mean? ...he wants to testify...? Gruber... ...yes. Get her on the phone... What are you doing here? Objection! ...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage. ...to get her heartbeat back...? Frank Galvin. We've met before. If I could accept the offer right now, I would. They took it back. I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars. I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case... It's all right, Mickey. Hold on a second. It's completely done on a contingency basis. That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third... that is, of course, the usual arrangement... I completely understand... I doubt we'll have to go to trial... I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here. Please sit down. I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here. I've got a case coming in two days in the Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers. No. No. Thank you. You go home. Yes... I... yes. No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home. No, you did fine. Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct? In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six. These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I... ...apartment. No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they... Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my... I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl... I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening... Dr. Thompson...? Thank you. If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...? ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask? And you wrote that... 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct? Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar? Uh, why, why are you doing this? Thank you... ...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony... We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss... The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of... The most respected... Do you know who her doctors were? I'm sorry...? Uh... in the, well, in the interests of her family... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution. Her doctors... Yes. Yes. The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate... They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much... ...Deborah Ann Kaye... I appreciate -- a man as busy as -- Dr. Gruber... A single hour. And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour? One hour. What did she say? D'you ask the patient when did she last eat? These are your initials, 'K.C.'? You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted... Kathy Price... That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop? Yes. Mrs... You're really... You, are you the one they told me was the nurse? Four. You're great with these kids. Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by. I've been meaning to come in a long time. Hi. How are you doing? Exception! I object, your Honor... Nothing further, your Honor... Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass. And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are. No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair. I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me. If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way... What? Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility? Ready, your Honor. I could subpoena him if I had a week. I had a witness disappear on me. I need an extension for my case. Thank you for seeing me. I'm sure you would. I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro... ...things change. My client can't walk, your Honor. This is a complicated case, your Honor... I was held up. Yessir. I'm sorry. Call the A.M.A. ...I can't talk now. ...tell them you're Dr. Somebody... you have to find this nurse... Thank you. I don't have a goddamned idea. No. No... no... Stop pressuring me... What is that to you...? It's over! You, you don't under... If I don't 'grow up...' Is there going to be a later...? And what makes you so tough? Who told you that? I... I... do you want me to leave? Yes. That's what I am. That's not the question. It's over. Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win. Do you think it's my fault? You're going to stay here...? I've got to work. No, no, I'm just... I've got to work... They, uh, they got to my witness. We, we... No... we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh... I have some work to do... What...? That's what I'm going to try to do. Maybe I can do something right. They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...' Jimmy! That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice. The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink? You just got lucky. D'you eat yet? Come on. My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight. A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name? Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off? Really. How wonderful for you. I'm a lawyer. What Hotel are you staying at? Why? I changed my life today. What did you do? D'you find an apartment? Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center... We have a renew-your-subscription offer... That's why I'm calling, Miss Price... We find that your subscription lapsed... Pardon? This is Miss Costello...? This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions? I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly... Hello, I'm calling from... Let me talk to Mickey. I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent. ...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him... I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number? Mr. Alito, please. You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand... Then why don't you testify? I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them? Who are you protecting, then? Who put my client in the hospital for life. I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand. Then why aren't you testifying for their side? You know what happened. I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no question of that. It's just a matter of how big... He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what? I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is? I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure. Yes. We, yes. Yes. They, they present their side, and I get the same chance. To cross-examine... to... to... I'm going to see you get that chance. ...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent... ...I understand... ...I understand... ...fifty thousand dollars? Yes. Yes, I have. ...I know. I went... ...I'm sure you do... A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic... It's not a good case. It's a very good case. It's locked? I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in? No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him... I... please. My wife... my wife's prescription has run out. If I can call him... Where is he? I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting... Dr. Gruber. It's a long road that has no turning. Well, well, well. Huh? I want to buy you a drink. ...everybody. Mike says, 'Pat, you mean to tell me for a buck you get a free lunch and a beer, and then you go in the back and get laid?' 'That's correct.' Mike says, 'Pat. Have you been in this bar ?' Pat says, 'No, but my sister has...' Everyone. Buy yourself one too. I don't want a mistrial. I don't know. What are you doing in New York...? What the hell are you doing here? Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello... ...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying... The Hospital...? We don't have anything from the Nurse Association? How old are you, how many children... when did you last eat... She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.' 'Kathy Costello...' Uh... the admitting nurse... What difference can that make...? All right... Who? They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand. 'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...' She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand... Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting? Are you with me... are you awake...? That's right. Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness? Yeah. I'm swell. Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her. D'you find the obstetric nurse? I can't talk now. Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it. I've got to go see Gruber. What's the best cigars you have? Oh shit, what's today? So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case. They still have to take it to a jury. So what? I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse? I'm going to get laid. Jimmy? Bushmills. Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport... Brindisi versus Electric Boat. Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... Admittance form is wrong. We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help. Mick, will you help me...? Will you help me...? ...I have to stand up for her... ...he's a good man... You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...' Mick. Mick. Mick... They killed her. And they're trying to buy it... I'm going to help her. ...I'm going to need your help... Come on. Let's get a drink. I have to talk to you. ...hey, I don't need your charity... Sally Doneghy, now who is that? ...now who is that...? Uh... Hi, Mickey... What? I just saw her. She told me. I spoke to her, and everything is all right. Huh. And why is that? Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...? Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat... What happened in those three minutes...? What happened in those three... ...they start again three minutes earlier... Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped. And they resume seven minutes... But those notations stop... ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's... ...of the procedures... ...there are notations every thirty seconds... You have a record of what happened in the operating room... Dr. Towler...To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it? ...that's perfectly all right. I understand. What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...? Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge... Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill? I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were. Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life. Her doctors murdered her. Her doctors killed her. Why? You're going to settle out of court? ...and you're going to do that? Right. Who called? ...Deborah Ann Kaye... I read the hospital report on your client. That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk? Yes? Galvin, right?I'm going to uphold that. The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form. It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original... ...one moment, Mr. Concannon... You may step down. I'll rule on that presently. Proceed. Mr. Galvin, rebuttal? Mr. Concannon...? Huh! The Doctors were not negligent. Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question? Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice? Noted. Thank you. Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed... Overruled... Mr. Concannon...? You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail. Are you done? Galvin, look, many years ago... Listen to me, fella... I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today. I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin. Let's not waste these people's time. Answer the question, Mr. Witness. Please. Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence? Yes, Mr. Galvin? I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...? Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records. Do we have time this morning to... All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon. Defense...? Is the Plaintiff ready? I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you. That happens. You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared. That's perfectly all right. What is it? And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself. I myself would take it and run like a thief. ...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred... That's it...? Come on, guys... life is too short... You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it. Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records. I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you. I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop? Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother. Why is that?It's a common medical term. Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means? She getting good care over there? Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say... What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics? Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please? ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to... Why is that? We got a mistrial, you know. Joe -- did you hear what I said...? I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association. The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago. She wanted to move to Boston. How badly did she hurt us, Joe? Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee... We got to talk. I need a cigarette! She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart... I need a cigarette... ...four years ago... ...yeah... good... The broad has disappeared... The 'History'...? What did she do? All right. Who wasn't in the O.R.? ...one of the other nurses? Read me what she said. The Doctors. Yeah. I'm awake. I think we tried that. The case is over. You use their witness. And all we've got is a witch doctor! How are you holding up? She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to... Yeah? How's our new witness? D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...? What happened, Joey...? Give 'em a box of Macanudos. Today is Tuesday. What? John: gimme a cuesta-ray. What I'm saying, they're getting some help. So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.' Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this. Been a long time, huh...? Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight? You got a good memory, Franky. Right. Right. No. ...Gruber's not bad. Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. Who have we got? Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back. ...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case. I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...? What? That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it. We let them buy the case. That's what I took it for. You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer... To do what...? To do what, for chrissake...? To help her to do what? She's dead... You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand? Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life? Are you out of your mind...? Don't touch anything. What do you want? ...I get these people to trust you -- they're coming here tomorrow by the way -- I get this expert doctor to talk to you. I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months. You're 'sposed to be in court. I bet you haven't even seen the file. One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way... ...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them... Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy... What the hell do you think you're doing...? What's going on here...? Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail. P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years. You like that story? Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over. Jimmy, gimme another drink. How are you? That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out. ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy. Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case. A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...? Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is? So far you're great. You got a cigarette? Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well. You'd better chain him until it's over. No, I'm alright. I'm alright. Not now, Chewie. Lando, aren't you afraid the Empire might discover this little operation and shut you down? Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix? That was a long time ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you. Well, it's been awhile. Then I'll see you in Hell. You bet it is ... and Luke's out in it. We'll have to go out on Tauntauns. Not likely! Where are the speeders? Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it! Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet? Fine. But they'll have to take care of themselves. Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look. Come on, Chewie. Thank you, General. But there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man. That's right. The Empire won't look for you out here. I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon. There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling. Good. Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive. Not collapsing, honey. It's closing! This is no cave ... I'm going to see what it is. You, too, golden rod. What are you so grouchy about? We're in trouble! I think we're in trouble. Sit down, and shut up! Transport XJ. get out of here. Go! The kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold. He doesn't make sense to me either, Chewie. Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon. I shut it off. What's her royal holiness want? What is it? ... just remember that, �cause I'll be back ... Me either. They had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions. I was worried about you. Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ... Well, I do trust him. Lando's an old friend. Must have been an accident. He found him in a junk pile ... Luke! I'm sure he's fine. Probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now. Huh? Oh. Your droid's been gone too long just to be lost. He may have gotten into some trouble. Chewie went to look for him. Come over here. I want to check this out. You look great. Who's staring? It'll be all right. Trust me. And keep your eyes open. You wait here. Let �er go, Chewie. No. But he has no love for the Empire, that much I know ... A Tibanna gas mine. Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back. Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ... ... your kind of guy. The system is called Bespin. It's a ways from here, but reachable. Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it! Lando Calrissian. Funny, I have the feeling I've been in this area before. Let me check my logs. Here ... near the Anoat system. Then we have to find a safe port around here. Got any ideas? The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed. Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws. Oh, so sorry! Didn't mean to offend your droid. You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy? Sharp bank, Chewie. Let's turn this bucket around. You heard me, turn around! Full power on the front shield. It's not my fault. I can't under- stand it! Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said! I tell you this time it's not my fault. I'm sure I checked it. I see it Chewie, hang on. Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off! There will be more of them. They always travel in groups. And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now. Look, we just got this bucket going again. I'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ... Where? Try and control this ... You mean a man you can control. Sure, they're safer. You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull. What are you afraid of? Why? That's quite a compliment. You could be a touch warmer, though. Admit it, against your better judgment you think I'm all right. Sure. I guess I make it difficult sometimes. Easy, your worship. Only trying to help. They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe. That was no earthquake. Fine with me. But I'm afraid you'll have to let go. Well, I hope you don't expect more. Beautiful. You don't look angry. Why, Princess, this is so sudden. That should do nicely. There, there. Chewie get a reading on that. Looks pretty good. Right. I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ... We've got to get out of this shower. But we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer. That Star Destroyer is slowing down. Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong. Aren't I? Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'. Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need. Asteroids! Chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ... That was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us .... Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us. I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what? This baby's got a few surprises left in her. Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started. Hey! Someone's still in here. Who's scruffy-looking? I tell ya' sweetheart, I must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this. Doesn't it look that way to you, Luke? Come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss? Ooops! I guess you haven't told Luke about that yet. Well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer. Now don't panic. We don't know that. Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It must have had a self-destruct .... .... I'm afraid there's not much left. No kidding. If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere. Forget it. Sure ... If I were interested. But I don't think it'd be much fun. Spare me please! Don't tell me about the Rebellion again. I've had it with your noble mission. All you let yourself think about is the Rebellion. The result is you're as cold as this planet. There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss. You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one. I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute. But it's too late now, sweetheart. Your big opportunity is flying out of here. Am I? I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss. You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me. You probably don't. How could you? You're so terrified of your own emotions ... Not you? We? He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look. Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me. If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else. I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head. That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind. Yes, Your Highness? Don't worry. You haven't seen the last of us. Now don't get the wrong idea, pal. She was just trying to express her true feelings for me. That makes a good story. But I think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight. That's two you owe me, junior. Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark. There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base. Loud and clear, kid. What's up? Yeah, you're a real hero. All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him? Luke? I don't get it. You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over. This ought to be good. Get out of here, Lando! I'm sorry too. Nothing. I never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer I knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... But you wear it well. How's your mining operation going? Hyperdrive. Repairs ... I always said you were a gentleman. No hard feelings?We're not out of this yet. Okay, okay. Three patrol ships are heading our way. What's wrong with him? Everyone's invited, of course. Right. How you doing, Chewbacca? Still wasting your time with this clown, eh? Don't shoot! I've done what I can for you. I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems. I've already stuck my neck out further than I should ... Don't ask me, but he's on his way. He doesn't want you at all. He's after someone named Skywalker. Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me. They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe. Shut up a minute and listen. I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you. Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. Not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient. I've had supply problems of every kind and ... What's so funny? I'll have my people get to work on it right away. Hate the thought of the Millennium Falcon without her heart. That ship saved my life a few times. It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy. What's wrong with her? What have you done to my ship? That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway? I'll bet. Are you kidding? Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you. That wasn't the bargain. You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in-- I'll take what's mine now. We only use this chamber for carbon freezing. If you put him in there, it'll kill him. No. That was never mentioned. Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain. What about Leia and the Wookiee? I'm sure my men fixed it. We've got nothing to worry about. The deflector shields are gone. Someone's falling. Wait a minute. We're not going back there. What? I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it. I didn't say anything? His fate is sealed. You'll be lucky to get out yourself. All systems are on alert. everything's locked. Don't worry about a thing. I'll get us going. Sure I did ... once. It turned out lousy. Very noble. Not smart, but noble. There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform. This is no time to be choosy, honey. What do you say we debate this later? There's still a chance I can get you out of here. Look, I stand to lose everything by this. I'm coming over to your side, that's what. And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake. Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ... I didn't know you had a price on your head. Vader has given you to the bounty hunter. Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city. It's connected by a transfer shaft. Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial. .... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire. Would you care to join me for a little refreshment? I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled. Truly you belong here with us among the clouds. Sorry, am I interrupting anything? Hello! What have we here? Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?You won't. And that is why I must go. I feel The Force. I can help them! But Han and Leia will surely die. Ben ... Ben ... I'm cold ... so cold ... I can't ... How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am. Can't we get on with this already? Because of my father, I guess. Will it take long to get there? How far away is he? Look, it smells good. I'm sure it's delicious But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now. ... I told you, I'm not hungry. You know the Jedi Master? I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master. Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do. I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it in this slimy mudhole. Give me that! Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't. So ... I'm looking for a great warrior. Yeah ... I'm looking for someone. ... Like we're being watched. I hope you make your peace with Jabba. About what? Probe? What probe? Thanks to you. I'll see you shortly. A meteorite just hit the ground near here and I want to check it out .. Won't be long. I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings. I've never seen it fail. He'll survive. Leia! Snow creatures ... they're here?! Jabba the Hutt? Calm down, will ya? Tell me about Han. Han's leaving? What are you talking about? I have this ... feeling. I'm not sure, really ... Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while? I'm fine. Really. Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things. And sacrifice Han and Leia? I've learned so much since then. And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master. They're my friends. Will they die? I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering. I see a city in the clouds. My mind fills with so many images. Ben? Ben? What's in there? I feel cold. Yes ... I also feel danger ... death. Something's not right. But tell me why ... But how am I to know the good side from the dark? Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger? Price? What do you mean? But I feel The Force flowing! They're a lot stronger than I'm used to. I thought those seekers were set for stun! I don't believe it. I can't. It's too big. Okay. I'll give it a try. Master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different. I thought I was in good shape. I will not fail you. I'm not afraid. I have followed my feelings. Why not me? Never. No! .... Never .... Time will tell. I'll die first. No! You'll find I'm full of surprises.No ... there is another. Told you, I did. Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse. Strong is Vader. Clouded is your fate. Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything! It can save you. Stopped they must be. Do you hear? On this all depends. Will he finish what he begins? He's too old. Yes. Too old to start the training. This one I have watched a long time. All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future. Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing. Adventure, excitement ... A Jedi craves not these things! Much anger in him, like in his father. If it must be. Yes. Yes, yes. To Obi-wan you listen young one. The tree. Remember your failure at the tree! Heh? Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too. You have far to go in your training. Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine! It is the future you see. Bespin. I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh? Concentrate and see them you will. Control, control you must learn of what you see. Not easy, not fast. Free your mind and return he will. Only what you take with you. This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force. A servant of evil it is. Into it you must go. Four this time! The Force you feel. No! Nothing more will I tell you now. Clear your mind of questions ... Quiet now be ... at peace ... You will know. When you are at peace ... calm ... passive. A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense. Never for attack. No, no. Easier, quicker, more seductive. The dark side beckons. But if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Consume you it will ... as it did Obi-wan's apprentice. Anger, fear, aggression! The dark side of The Force are they. Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight. Beware, beware, beware of them. A heavy price is paid for the power they bring. No, no. This will not do. Anger is what you feel. That would matter not were The Force flowing through you. Higher you'd jump! Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must. That they are. Concentration. Heh? Concentration. That is why you fail. Size has no meaning. It matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size do you? No. Try not. Do, do. Or do not. There is no try. No! No different! The differences are in your mind. Throw them out! No longer of use are they to you. Yes, but by what standard, ask I? Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn. It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi. You will be, my young one. Heh. You will be. You are reckless! To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. Ready are you? What know you of ready? I have trained Jedi for 800 years. My own counsel I'll keep on who is to be trained.You're all just jealous. I did?! I broke the world's record. ... One thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... What's the World's Record for this? Who brought up this bright idea? Yes, you can. Come on, Shelly! Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time. But you gotta stop doing these things. Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I? So don't embarrass me. When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself. Same thing. Dammit Shelly! Why do you always have to be such an asshole! Do you want a beer or not? I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one? Hey Deb... can you hear me? You're too clean for me. What're you doin'? I vote for me. I'll think of something. I know how to do it. I mean, how do we do it in the hammock? How do we do it? If you insist. How about a roll in the hay? We haven't looked in the barn, yet. Let's take a look. Sounds disgusting. Let's go. I don't know... Where's Shelly? Breakfast? I didn't mean it the way it sounded... So what would a weekend in the country be without sex? What're you gonna do?That's an eyeball! Oh, God! What is that? I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off? Where are you going? Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is. I was just kidding. According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago. We were looking for something to keep our hands busy. It was either this or an orgy. Vera chose this. What're ya gonna do? No more... I can't! Would you be yourself... ...if you looked this this? I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor. You don't to say it. I can tell. Being a jerk is better than being nothing. I just want you to like me. I have to. You've just learned a valuable lesson. A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone. Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today. I like you... very much. I was thinking that maybe. A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new. It was nothing. Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right? Stop the car! Now!! No time to explain. Just listen. When I yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can. Okay? Just keep your eyes on the road. Maybe. I don't see anything. Just a dirty window. Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that. Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon. Gulp! Are they following us? Please... be cool. Excuse me, but I believe that's mine... Is... is everything all right? Not us! He's really creepy. That scarecrow? Can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him. Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry. Faster! Eat faster! What are we gonna do? Stick around and you'll see. My whole world. I'm sorry. Hi.Let go of her. Look fella...this is private... Sounds good. Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and... Thanks. Follow me. Yeah. But he ain't here now.Riverdale. No, all we got is $40. You got sparklers? No. Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth... We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets? Well, we want good stuff. Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy... Well the guy over there said...Uh...can we give you a check? Can't we come with you? Why? Yeah.Whether she wants to or not...she's not going. Nothing's private... It's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it? Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch. Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out... What are your plans? No, really, I liked it...thought it was great. Know where he is? Isn't this Jack Groppi's place? Sure. And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right. Panther! Same thing... Thanks for the ride. I'll say that I'm travelling. Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself. I'll write. Yeah, well thanks, but I got enough to hold me. My mother can send me some. I don't know. Hey, come on... No. Yeah. So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there. It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350. Kennedy. Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean? She don't look Jewish. How do you know? Who's the girl? I don't know, but God help him if he does it again! 'Thou sayest it; I am a king. This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.' 'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.' 'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?' Salute!!! May God be with you. Anybody wanna have a game? Look who's talking. Pretentious bullshit. Who's the guy with William Blake and the tigers, eh? And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE... I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it? See what I mean? A question please...'Is this what you call living?' Be careful. Don't go to any trouble. We believe you... We believe you. You got some mouth! It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you. Next time, bet with your own kind. Not quite...but keep trying. Good idea. Forget it. No. He has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him. Mind your own business. Don't you move!!! Come on. NO!!! What do you think I am, crazy??? Oh, cut it out, will ya? Take it. I'm doing it for you, stupid! You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you? Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this... Don't be smart. Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you. We've been in here calling... Shut up! Keep your mouth shut. That's what I get for getting involved. Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok? This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him. If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand? I'm not asking I'm telling you!! I don't get involved with anything, you understand that? Nothing! I'm clean as far as you know...right? That'll help you out fine. That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this. You understand? I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. How? Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand? It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash? That's not going to help. Let's get out of here. Stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this. Cut it out stupid. It's me. I could have told you that. I won't wait until Tuesday. I'll break your arms right now. Don't promise...just deliver. I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid. Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other? You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up. You sick or what? You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid? What do you mean? You couldn't handle shit. You just better come through with some kind of payment on Tuesday...anything. Understand? Hold onto your pay- check this week. Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble. You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget. You'd better make a move kid. He thinks you're trying to screw him. No, she isn't. Should I slap him? C'mon Tony, waddaya say? All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face? I know but let's hear it anyway. What happened to you Flash? Giovanino! Where have you been? My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself. I don't understand, where's Groppi? He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that. Not next week's either...listen...you tell that to Giovanni, not me. That bad, huh? What pipes? No. Ok, how's everything going? You're really crazy. Yeah, where's the rest? Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him? We'll be here. 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.' 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away! 'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...' $3,000. Shit! Can we hold it at $3,000? How much was the original loan again? He'll be here. Look, take this for now. Let's go to the movies...on you. How much? What's a'matter? We'll settle it tonight. Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok? Oh Michael, look... Yeah, thanks, it's ok. C'mon Johnny. Disgraceful. Get him in. Michael, give us a lift. Michael, believe me. You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes. I vouched for him and he'll come through. I promise. I'll talk to him and straighten him out. Don't worry, OK? You're right. You're right. Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts. You know that. Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that. Look...I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right? Nope... No...I'll be ok for a week. OK, ok... Oh great...hey - Winstons? Bye. Ok. Chinese. We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish. Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight. No...no stripping...as the hostess. I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place. In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything. No, I'm serious...You're really good. You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a... aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer... Diane, how are you feeling? Oh yeah, that's a possibility. All right. What do they expect you to say? No, she's got epilepsy. Teresa. What did he do? Oh yes, he's pretty good. Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure. I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that? Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is... Oh...around...why? Ok. About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want. You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else. About that shooting last night...I was there and... Uncle, how are you feeling? Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times. It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft. "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber." "Francis Macomber." Nothing. Wasn't a book...was a short story. Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight? Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye. Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie. Listen, I'm looking for your cousin. Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday. I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is? I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all... Now don't get excited. Don't get excited!! You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine. Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon. ...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time. I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it? I know...I know. Well you can't blame them in a way. Uhuh...probably a good idea. Why don't you do it this time? Watch your language. That W.A.S.P. bastard. No. Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't? See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you? That's the word...preoccupied. Take your time. I don't care. Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first. Bore. No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right. Not sick...just stupid. Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food. You missed the point. The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation. He thinks he's in good standing. CHRIST, you should have seen it. Unbelievable. The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin. That kid was scared. Not half as much as we were though. Did you? Don't ask. You know...like restaurants, night clubs... See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place. Nobody knows anything, believe me. Maybe, who knows. Well, if things go the way I hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself. God willing. Sure...it's not that...I mean... Well... Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen... Ok, we'll go for lunch.Well, maybe you missed something? Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved. Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them? Lock her up? Yeah. That's what I said, sick in the head. ...The one who's sick, right? In the head. His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you... ...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...Our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do. They know where to come when they need us. I realize this during the war...World War II...Vito Genovese... during WWII he worked with the government, taking care of the docks... What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway. You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it. Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming? Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house. And when he was there...at night... You heard what happened to GROPPI, eh? Hey, where you been? Take a drink! No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you. Yes, you did. No you weren't. Fine. Did you have a good time last night?What are you going to do? Hide me? This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame. I think we should see your uncle. Hello, Michael. I've got something for you...not much...but... Back so soon. I'll be here. Don't worry. No, I just want to help myself, that's all. Charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing. The only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you? No you're not... What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me! Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie... I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember? Well kids...have the bans been announced yet? Oh, that's too bad, Teresa... Yeah, Teresa, shut up! We don't wanna get Charlie here in trouble, do we?...We love Charlie. You tell me that in front of these creeps? I understand. Yeah, take it easy. Will you relax. If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can. Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess. I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it. I'm going to work this week...I mean it. I swear to God Charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why I didn't go to work. I swear it. Did you see them run! Hey...don't do that...I'm only scaring them. Don't come any closer!!! We'll get some food from my aunt's. I'll get in through the fire escape. She's always got something. Hey...you got nothing here. Listen...I'm a guest here. Ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast? Ok, ok...take it easy. I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise. What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh? You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do? I don't like loading crates. Didn't show up. There won't be any this week. Don't worry. I can handle it. Wouldn't bother me. I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she? Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie. Nah. It's the truth, I swear. I swear to God Charlie, it's the truth. Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this. Drinks for everybody Tony... Count it. I feel fine--nothing wrong with me. Girls? You call those skanks girls?! Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin. Scumbag-- Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what? Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one. and a double for you and Charlie here. And put it on my tab, willya? This is a heisted car! You mean it's heisted. Yeah, it's your father's. What'sa matter...forget your registration? Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us. Hey... you got stereo. This is some boat. Your father's? Sal!... fourteen street. Must have been all the liquor in him. Friends of yours Michael. I know what you're going to say but don't say it. These drinks are all on the tab. I'm gonna see you this Tuesday payday, I promise. I give you my word. Of course! A double for Michael, Tony.Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash. Now, you got it or not? You sure? That means it's good. Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit? Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit. Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs. Yeah. Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means? All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you... Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful. Sssh! Quiet. Y'know that's illegal. A check? What the...hey, where you kids from? Hey hold it! Gimmie the cash. Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business. I'll be back in thirty minutes. I gotta get the stuff. Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me. Ok. Wait here. You're not going to use that gun, Johnny. Where's the rest? Whatever. Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right? You said it. He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money... I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it. Charlie, this is business. $500. He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000. You kiddin. The way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours. Well, he isn't. Nice...real nice. $20. Nothin'. Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions. All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of. I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing. Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore... You getting out too? Out!!!! Ok...that's it. Hey, shut up. OK, get in. OK. I don't know that. That's what I'm telling you. I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right? ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that. I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me... Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean... You seen Johnny Boy tonight? Sell 'em if you can't smoke them. For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see... Quiet please. Shut up. Just keep him quiet. You what? How about me? I don't get a drink John? Ok guys...have a heart. This is my business. Sure. Not bad. $20. Here, $5.Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too. Hey...no more good times like before. Until you come back. Panther... Listen, try a place with some sun. Swimming pools. Palm trees. Girls in little French bathing suits. And say what? How about Teresa? I could talk... Take it easy. I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something. You flew before? Nervous? So? I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'? Where to? Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands. Get out of here before this really goes up. Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are. Look at her. Jewish... Prophesy to us, oh Christ! Who is it that struck thee? 'Thou art then a king?' 'Art thou the King of the Jews'? 'And with your spirit.' No. You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know. Like to see what kind of business you'd do. 'Take a little tip from Mack the Knife...' Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that... Keep quiet about this. I don't have any license for him yet. I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me. I'm the only one he trusts. Watch. Shut up. We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves. Yeah, so things'll be even. Which one, the big tab or the little tab? Yeah. Thanks. Can you spare it? How much?Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope. Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program? No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on? We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons. Someone with that access has been tampering. oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you? Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going? Come on in... You wouldn't dare. If you think - What do you want with the Pentagon? Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you. The Pentagon? It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much... I'm sorry - Cute. I think we'd better shut off all access till we can find that file. Just to be safe. Meanwhile, he might find it. He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it? Flynn? No problem, Master-C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show... What's up? I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink? It can be arranged... Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore -- The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that -- Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life... And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on. I know, I met him. Want one? My dinner. Hi, Alan. Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access... Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high.. Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it. Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime. Yepper. And Vice Squad, and Meltdown... whole slew of 'em. I was this close to starting my own little enterprise. But: enter Ed Dillinger. Another software engineer -- not so young, not so bright, but very, very sneaky. One night, our boy Flynn goes to his terminal, tries to read up his file, and ... nothing. A big blank. We now take you to three months later. Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has "invented" -- the slime didn't even change the names -- and he gets a big fat promotion. Thus begins his meteoric rise to...what is he now, Executive V.P.? Sherman, set the Wayback Machine for...oh, 1973. Kevin Flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at ICOM. He's so bright that he starts going in there at night, and sets up a private memory file, and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing, called... ...Space Paranoids. You haven't told him? "Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey... No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together. Tried to. Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ... Let's get outta here. So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move? This town's full o' live ones. This honey doesn't handle so good in town... Way to go! We're haulin'! Another mouth to feed... you don't by any chance know how to drive this crate? I'm your program? where's your program? Won't it miss you? only yes and no... You're a bit. Oh. Anything else? That all you can say? What do you mean, "'yes"? Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all... Hey... you guys OK? Did we make it? Not us, I hope. What about our friend - Sark? All right. Thank God. Alan stayed awake, at least. I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too. Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on. You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever. It's time I levelled with you, Tron. I'm a -- well, I'm what you guys call a User. No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it. I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it. Yeah, I... oops! Greetings, program... How about over there...that empty memory? What's that? You know anybody that's got an army for rent, that's fine...but my, uh, User said to go take that sucker out. An' let's face it, the big ox isn't gonna get any weaker. I feel like hittin' him now, while I'm good an' mad. Some nerve... what does he care whether you guys get killed, long as he keeps rakin' in quarters? I, uh... I'm a program from a User that... knows Alan...? Well, isn't it -- ? Alan! Shhhhh. Probably. Jump. Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it. Let's get some power here. Elementary physics... a beam of energy can always be diverted... ooh, my head Are we there yet, Mommy? There's another beam! Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go. What's wrong with that area? Boy the view from up here... you know the territory? Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere... Hey... ! Damn! Never fails... minute the warranty runs out... Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us - What's goin' on? Feel what? You okay? It grows on you. Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ... It's all circuits... Must be an input/output component... Watch it! Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP Tron...? Oh, uh...I don't remember too much... Yeah, yeah -- that's great. Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before? Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody. Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I? Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap? Are you kidding? You guys'll he running this joint by then... you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for? Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running... Not much chance of that now. The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it... Boy, I bet I know who's workin' late tonight. Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know... Whew. You never were much for small talk. She still leave her clothes all over the floor? So...how's the world of serious science? Good luck. You can't even think in here. Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn? Dumont! Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass? Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder. Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again. Well I want to communicate -- I... have come to communicate with my User. How about you? Yes. Not with this disk. I'm going to check on the beam connection, Yori. You two can keep a watch out for grid bugs. Probably decided not to pursue us, The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusions...rough navigating. Programs have a way of just... disappearing here. We're on our way. Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master Stranger and stranger... Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but -- Then... But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ... Wrote the...? Flynn... Where's Ram? You're alive! Flynn!! No good...they might block off the old chip. This way. Tanks...coming back. Let's go. What, just the three of us? The name of my User, yeah. But how... ? Where did you hear that name? I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first. We have to. Do it! They'd better be...I don't want to bust outta this dump an' find nothin' but a lot of cold circuits waitin' for me. Another free program off line. What's his User s'posed to do -- ? Where's Flynn? Nice... We have to get off this beam! What is it? This is Flynn... the one who busted me out. As long as it gets us out of here I had to...in the games... Why is everything...like this? Don't know yet... I have to get in touch with Alan. He was going to tell me how to That's all going to change, Yori... Yori... hey...
