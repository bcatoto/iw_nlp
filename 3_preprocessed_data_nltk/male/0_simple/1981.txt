Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me! Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something! Hopeless. It's hopeless. Will you shut up!?!! I swear, I don't know this girl. What? Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake! Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police. I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I... Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex. Pull over. I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time. I should be committed. I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind. Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex? Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific! I'm freezing. See you later. A doper werewolf. Okay. Yeah, I do, but go to work. Werewolves simply do not exist. Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive. Do me an enormous favor? That's good, Alex. Reassure me. I wasn't hallucinating. I was awake and he was in my room. Good. Will you be here in about fifteen minutes? Alex? It's nice to see you. There is only one bed. Lovely. Charming. Very nice. Yeah, I would think so, too. I was dreaming again? Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think? My friend Jack was just here. I'll let you know the next full moon. I'm a werewolf. Now I'm embarrassed. Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it. Not just a patient -- me. Will you think about it? I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship. Will you come with me? I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them. No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while. I'm sorry I woke you up. Yes, go on. What? Oh, yes, please. My best friend. My very best friend. Now what do you want to talk about? I'm twenty-seven. How old are you? How old are you? It's okay. I want to talk to you. I dream of death mostly. Do you like it? I was. What are you reading? You're a very beautiful girl. Will you give me a break? This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food. Call me David. Aw come on, Alex! Aw come on, Miss Price! Leave the pills. I'll take them later. How is that? Please, really. I'm not hungry. I'm not very hungry, thank you. Yes? A wolf. It was a wolf. It wasn't a lunatic. That's what I want you to do, you moron! Who is this girl? Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss! Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit! Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me! Officer, I killed those people last night. Why are you doing this to me? That's easy for you to say - you're already dead. Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you. Why are you doing this to me, Jack? Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi? Do you have bad dreams, too? What are you going to see? Alex? What time is it? I was having a nightmare. Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself. You really think I'm crazy, don't you? Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that. Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb? Did you see Jack? Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands. I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog. Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre. Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about. How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about. There were witnesses? Lunatic? Two weeks? How long have I been here? Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here? The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London? London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream. Where am I? I could hang myself. How shall I do it? Hello. Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack. I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it. You look awful. Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'? What can I say, Jack? Hi, Jack. I will not accept this! Now go away! What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit! I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream. Jack, are you really dead? A monster. I know, I know. Get out of here, Jack! I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf. Okay, you've seen me. Now go away. What are you doing here? You're not real. Nurse! Oh God! Alex! Nurse! Nurse! You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue! Jack, please go away. Please go away. Stop it, Jack. What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit! What?! Will you be quiet?! What's wrong with you? Shut up! Shut up, you zombie! I'm not listening! If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead! Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf? What?! I'm going completely crazy. Rudy Levine the shmuck? I can't stand it. Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person. Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace? Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger! This is too much. I can't handle this. Get the fuck out of here, Jack. Are you going to help me up? Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!! Where are we going? Jack? It sounds far away. See anything? Walk away, Jack. A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away. It's in front of us. Let's just keep walking. What's the plan? It's moving. Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving. I don't know. Come on. Yeah. No, but he was on the moors. Heathcliffe. The Hound of the Baskervilles. A coyote. Could be a lot of things. I heard that. I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you. I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly. I have no idea. Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob. That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea. Come on, I'm freezing. I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road. Come on, Jack, shall we go?!! Jack, we'd better go. You ask them. Wrong. I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters. You ask them. Maybe the owners are from Texas. What about it? Listen, at least it's warm in here. Hello. Shall we? I assume full responsibility. A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol. Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol? Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol? We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that? It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull. If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you. I don't know. I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break. She's a jerk. I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body. Right. Well, I like it here. You're not having a good time are you? Jack. Yes.I doubt it. But it's something to do. Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog. Tea would be nice. I expect you shortly. Shall I send a car? You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help? Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand? Could you get here without any trouble? Is David acting strangely? Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television? The zoo? Is he rational? Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he? Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy. Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others. David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon? You've absolutely no idea where David might be? I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf. They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there. I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things. Warn him? What did he say? Has his friend appeared to him again? Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies? It's a full moon. Where is he? Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David. Come to my office, Miss Price. Did he say a wolf? The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price. That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed. What exactly did he call out? Oh, Miss Price? Go about your duties. Can I be of service, Miss Price? Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital. Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price. Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake. David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly. I really don't know. No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here. You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of. Yes. Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you? You've never had bad dreams before? In time I'm sure it will all come back to you. So they said. Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now. You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten. You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago. Miss Price! Miss Price, please! Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead. I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences. You're in a hospital in London. Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins. What can we do to assist you? Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him. Why don't we ask him? You were saying? Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard? Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea? Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls! What here? Excuse me. Yes? Send them in. Yes? I see. You've heard nothing about the incident? What's that? I suppose Guinness will suffice. Campari and soda would do nicely.If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death. Because this must be stopped. Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy. David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly. I want you to meet some people. What about the zoo? Thank you. If I was still alive, I probably would. You don't have to say anything. Hi, David. The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life! You must believe me. What do you think? You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late. David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become... Yes. David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on. I wanted to see you. Don't be an asshole, David. Come here. It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others. The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me. Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance. David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins. You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night. Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days. Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.' You survived and now you shall continue the curse. It's you, David. The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed. I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted. On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf. We were attacked by a werewolf. I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know. David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you. David! Life mocks me even in death. So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed. Debbie Klein cried a lot. Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came. I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come. David! You're hurting my feelings. I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me. Thanks a lot. Nice to see you. You really scared me, you shithead. I'll tell you when we get there. Yeah. Not far enough. Come on. No. Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away. Nice doggie. Good boy. Oh shit. What is that? Do you think it's a dog? Plan? It's circling us. Come on, where? Shit! David, what is that? I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb. It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'. Heathcliffe didn't howl. Pecos Bill. There aren't any coyotes in England. Yeah? What was it? Did you hear that? Say, David... Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural. What do you think was wrong? I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob. Beware the moon? What the hell was that all about? Apparently so. What do you mean? I'm starving. Go on, ask them. Right. Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man. Ask them what the candles are for. It's a five-pointed star. Look at that. Nice looking group. Nice to see you. Okay. David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault. That's not a spear. It's a pike. That's a wolf's head. The Slaughtered Lamb? She says she 'likes me too much'. It is impossible for a body like that to be dull. I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really. Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared... Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there? You're talking about the woman I love. Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time. Do you think she'll meet me in Rome? I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later. Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place? David. Good. Are you cold? Remember the Alamo? Oh. Then you have some hot tea? Hot chocolate? Do you have any hot soup?THE ART WILL START WHEN I PLAY MY PART AS THE HEALER WHO WILL STEAL YOUR HEART Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues? What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block. I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week. And Hank says Danny's moved to New York. To better himself. I'd forgotten. Mental instability? YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCESOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT Faith, Betty. But make sure it's your own. President? Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up. Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley? In a little masquerade? Care to indulge? Yes, Betty. But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset. Yes. Macabre, isn't it. The blind leading the blind. A 'stately pleasure home' indeed. Clever of you to find this spot, Betty. Yes, Betty. Now Betty, don't overreact. ...closed? Ah yes. Farley Flavors. You know, I find it... It's happened before. Remember Lieutenant Orpheus? He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back. McKinley?...McKinley? Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front? What an ideal couple. A free thinker. Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man. Judge Wright? Now, Betty? First name terms, surely! Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly... In a way...--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered! When you threw it in, what did you see? --Take Excalibur. Find a pool of calm water and throw the sword into it. There is one thing left to do... Excalibur... And you must do it, Perceval. Leave my wounds, I command you. In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir... Is he coming? You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together-- Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die. Hasn't Merlin mended your wound? They miss the battlefield. I think we do too. Your deeds set an example for all other knights. For your gift, ask a gift of me. I do. Rise, Lancelot, come with me. Lancelot, how did you fare in the North? And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion. But your life and lands are far from here. You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson. Thanks to God, you are alive. So be it, to the death. Fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. Your avoidance mocks me. I will not. Move aside! --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility. I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way? Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own. Lancelot?... It is Lancelot! I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there. Of Merlin? Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule. ...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was... ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must. At last... Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin! Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana-- What is this place, Merlin? Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives. I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin? Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight. With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at... I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister... I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it? Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me. Merlin, tell me. Now that Guenevere is returned to me... Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom? Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems? ...to ride out and meet them. Excalibur! Is it true? You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge. So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you. I should have left you to fend for yourself. Guenevere... Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then. I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered. ...of course... Then as knight to knight I can offer you mercy. What?! What book is that? How? Where? It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I-- I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired... Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him. Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how-- I want to thank you. You saved me from the arrow... Whose son am I? Who is Merlin? So be it. I cannot offer you the land, only my love... Your mother told you that? I recognize you only as my son, no more. Rise, Mordred. We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go. Who is, then? I did, Father. I beg your forgiveness. Sir... Kay needed a sword. His was stolen. I saw Excalibur, and... I took it. I left it in the tent, sir. Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be. The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come... If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband. The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf. Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen. Without Lancelot?! I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here. I grant you your wish if you grant Lady Guenevere hers. I'm going. I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter. But I have to leave tomorrow. The forests are thick with rebels, invaders plunder our shores... Ye...--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty... My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table. Arthur. It is deep... But one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the King's law. Only give me leave to ride out again, to do what I am most able to do, and happiest doing. These men repented before God for their evil deeds. Those who would not, met their fate at the end of my sword. Accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift. We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights... My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it. I gave up my castles and my lands! Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place. I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King. It is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must. Sir, your rage has unbalanced you. It seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around. I sought only not to harm you, sir. Yield. I have the advantage. I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God. Not a boast, sir, but a curse. Never have I met my match in joust or duel. I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service. I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training. Good day to you, sir. The King without his sword, the land without a king... Why didn't he kill us? There are things about love-- The law forbids it. I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman. Yes. I would swear my love to you. You. There is one. I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough. No. --It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection. Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here. Very well. Climb up. Just a man. A knight in the King's service.--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams... But, I'm here. It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events. But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece. I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones... I cannot. I must not. Here I must stay. You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king... My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks... Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself. That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too... What? The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword. A king should be afraid, always. The enemy is everywhere. Waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle, on the deer paths of his forest, or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest, in here. Yes. What is it my child? Never where you expect it, that's all I know. Good and evil; there is never one without the other. At your service, sir. The knights of Galys approach the camp. It would be politic... The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly! Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you? I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today. You're not listening. Your heart is not. Love is deaf as well as blind. Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you. There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it. A king must marry, after all. What's this, what's this?! The dragon! There... The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders. In the great book. Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur? Thank you. Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen. It is whispered in the forest that... ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens. 'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up. That's not why you came. But not from your destiny. You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur. Speak of the devil!... --I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight. I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames. What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake. What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it. I won't. You would misuse such power. I have paid enough for you, and I will have you. Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings... They do. When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me. That I cannot. Maybe... maybe... I showed you all my conjuring tricks... Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana. No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name... I'm not jealous! No, no, of course not. You are young... It is. You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding? They are not weapons, my friend, but truths. You betrayed the Duke, stole his wife and took his castle, now no one trusts you. Lot, Uryens, your allies will turn against you. Give me the child, Uther, I will protect him. Go back to your war tent. Maybe not even that, Uther. I thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword. But it'll take another, a greater king... It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child. You didn't ask! The child is mine, Uther. I have come for him. Now you must pay me. Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength. --What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again. I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when. Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow. Speak the words. Just show the sword. It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
