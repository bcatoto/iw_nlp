And you've a new wardrobe. He does want you to look attractive. He tells me you're very beautiful. Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel. We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete. It's Mother you have to convince. He's very agitated. Wait here. Mobile HQ. In a blue funk. Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ... Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect. Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died. Mother betrayed me. She was going to replace me with a younger Father. Errand boy that's all I was. 'Find Steed...' You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black Leather ... Steed We want Mrs. Peel. So you say ... Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer? A series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...You're not venturing alone, surely. Very good, Mrs. Peel ... Privately owned by ... 'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation... Under the circumstances Mother didn't see fit, but I think I can get you in ... The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative -- I was getting to it. Makes two of us. Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling. Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance? Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ... Half-brother to be precise. Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch: Valentine Peel. Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel? Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ... About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ... The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment. This is an official matter, Mrs. Peel. No need to take it personally. Where are you going? Quite frankly ... it could have been you. A cover ... for us. I'm sorry... Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority. Government approved. The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ... We want to help...! You need treatment, Mrs. Peel. You can't resign. London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world. Would it be possible to use it for military purposes? Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire. The Ministry's worried. Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes. Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out. My number two. Special assignments. She's -- Looks like rain, Steed... Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it. Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ... I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel. Where? You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I. Mother and Father know best. Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs. Peel. Unfortunately -- Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ... This man -- did you see him? Too late anyway. Today's escapade was only for starters. This is no ordinary weather. It's manmade. A kind of weather bomb. You. Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry. She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk. If she is, there's only one solution. Termination. Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open. She may try to kill you. Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out. Possibly. Split personality ... She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill. Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise. Oh yes I did. I want you to meet somebody. I expect you'll like her. Weather's turning nasty. Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.No need. I'll call again. There are limits? You don't say. How real does it feel? Seriously? Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June? Shame. I was recommended. By a friend. Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ... Our chaperon. Not quite. It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel. As a matter of fact I have ... English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ... A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... 'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' The plot. Hello, we must be going ... Mrs. Peel? Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder. No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well. Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ... I'll be back ... Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers? They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel. Snuff. I must insist you try some. You first. Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's. Intoxicating. Here, have one of these. What's that you're wearing? There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend. You didn't tell her? We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ... I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you. You'll find out. His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones. Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful. Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies? Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ... Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who? I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling: he's disappeared ... I told Mother I took care of you. You don't trust me? After you -- Mrs. Peel ... Winning isn't everything. I thought you didn't. Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel? Not for a moment. Keeping a stiff upper lip? I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ... ... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust. Always. Except ... No trouble. Nothing personal. Orders. I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ... The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ... Mrs. Peel ... ? I expect we'll have to gatecrash. Here's the one that broke the camel's back. You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you? What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing? Do you always drive this fast? Oh, well ... Just my type, Mrs. Peel. According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior. Q.E.D. ... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you. No sisters? No undiscovered twin? ... And by you, Mrs. Peel ... Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research. But if someone miniaturized the process... Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ? Is there anything that isn't? Don't bother. Here's a bus ... For you, Mrs. Peel. Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ... Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ... What on earth? Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ... Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry. Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion? I must say, you look more your old self -- An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...? Did he say who? Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel. Frankly that's how I remember it. Why should they think that? I might say the same. I wasn't about to. Strange. Ah, Brenda ... Mrs. Peel? Small talk. Try the weather. All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY. British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens. The family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined. Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie. According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ... I meant me. After our fencing match, I was rather hoping you would do the risking. More tea? They call me in when they've reached a dead end. Freelance. Like yourself. For a man in my position -- As per mother's instructions. The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen. A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor. Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you. Do you really think so? Thank you, Trubshaw ... Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a hand-made shoe. As unique as a face or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA? Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod. Yes indeed. I need protection. Really? I fail to see the connection. Ah ... From Trubshaw's. My shoemaker. ... Showers followed by sunny periods. I didn't. Mother did. Much better. I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel? Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing. Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules. Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor. Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think? I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since -- I was about to throw in the towel. Doctor Peel, I presume? Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ... It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry. How did you guess? Dead, I'm afraid. Oh, hello ... We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel. Global warming? In your operation. I'm going to follow up on a hunch of my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is innocent and you have a mole. I was hoping you could tell me. Guilty until proven innocent? You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband? No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all. Impossible. We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ... Anyone particular in mind? How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling? Why? Insane ... ? Amnesia? Think she really killed those agents? Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel -- You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely. Mother. I thought you were burglars. Wonderland Weather Ltd. You don't say. Like looking for a needle in a ... Both, actually. She was ... I feel sure of it. I think so, thank you so much ... I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel? You are, and it's behind you. Did I? My mistake. I do. Rules are made to be broken. One shot -- for emergencies. Bang-bang ... you're dead. I was at Harrow ... Perish the thought. Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.How's that football story corning along? A bit unexpected, wasn't it? And your lady? Good night? Good God, no. But with skill like that, what do you want a job for? You don't need to work. I get it. Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we... Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid. Who was he? She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend. Looking forward! Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here... It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of room. My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care. Right. Look, I must get back to Habib. I thought it was you. It's the hair! We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds? All right. As what? Hi-ya... I'll call you back. Now then... Did she? You were pretty thick at one time. What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?A couple I know are getting married. Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt. I don't know anything about it. What are you talking about? Ouch. Not like Matt, you mean. The Indian rope-trick. I despise the job. You called the casino a cesspit. I can imagine. Why did you quit? I hate cheats. It's the tension. Goodnight. Maybe another time. No. Thanks. Is it that bad? Jack Manfred. Eight-fifty. Is that your idea of arithmetic? What?! How about fifteen hundred? What's the Blue Book price? You said it was going to be social, Giles. No business. Not entirely. She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you. Not particularly. Get what? Are you accusing me of cheating? Last hand. It's nothing to do with money. I don't gamble. I don't gamble. She. I found her in bed with someone. South African women are very sporty. I'll try and make it. Habib? I'm working on that soccer story. I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you? I want a job, Giles. We all played the field. She went back to South Africa. Three years, two months. March '93. I want to buy a car. I hate public transport. Leave me alone, Marion. Then what? Marion! What did you tell the police? There was a message, wasn't there? How did you know I was here? Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds. Gambling's not about money. Never. Why do you ask? Not talking. Writing. What? Within a month. Believe me, I'm going to quit! I'll leave the casino soon. I promise. You're entitled to your opinion. That girl, she works at the casino -- It will. It's beautiful. Thank you. Leave it. Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative. It's the truth. Marion. It's a book. -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it. He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner. Why not? I'm on at nine. What about a drink on the way home? You're my conscience. Marion, stop this. Do you have to swear all the time? Probably. I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective. Don't play the cop with me, Marion. I'll see you in my dreams. It's only hair. I haven't changed. Tension. It'll go. Fine. I don't know. Are you trying to read my palm? There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious. I start Monday week. I had training. In the Republic. It came my way. 450 a week. In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer. I've got a job. I've got something to tell you. Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it. I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another. I. sold the car. Turn around. You really are a beautiful woman. You want me drunk? You mean I won't resist them. I won't. Goodbye, dad. Yes, I know that. So how are you doing, dad? All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him. It's not that. No. Great. Did you solve your problems? How are you? Jani! Where are you? Hello... I don't think we should meet again. No thank you. And your hand too. I've still got mine. That bruise has cleared up nicely. Yes. It's all relative. I need the money too. It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place. Yes. What for? Did they tell you to sleep with me? How much do you owe? Wait a minute... I can't do it, Jani. What about my neck? Reynolds? You've done your research. What ten thousand pounds? But if it does. What'll you do when it all goes wrong? And I thought you were only after my body. You're serious. Robbery's not criminal? And I thought you were a bright woman. Forget it, Jani. It'll never work. Who's they? I don't have any money. switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed. Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you. What kind of trouble? Then you're not a pro. It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it. You choose. Remember the guy who cheated at the table? I'll watch. Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room. Turn left ahead. How did you hurt your hand? I don't gamble. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology. We all came from Africa, supposedly. And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft. The debts. Your father? In the casino. I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast. First visit to London? So why did you come to my casino? There's a casino in this hotel. Impossible to calculate. It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters. Oh hello. I've lived there. I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa. I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. Of course I recognised him! Who did it? Tell me! Who... Turn left at the lights. Nice car. How much did you pay for it? Are you going to put a spell on me? And what do you do, Lucy? Have I? I'd like to buy you a drink. What happened to Bella? Rough day? Don't worry. "The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway. I'm off. I need to sleep. I don't gamble. No thanks. Does Bella come here? Vodka. Straight. On the rocks. And the girls? Who are these guys? You're talking about complicity. Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that. If I see you do it again, I'll report it. I'm not going to report it. That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s. Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating. Some other time. No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours. You've done pretty well. How long have you worked at the casino? Nice car. Thanks. Over the river. Wait a minute. You got yourself barred. I'm afraid that's not so, sir. You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet. I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet. Bruised. A pleasure. Pity about Bella. He's paying out in stacks of 25. Does he win? All right, Mr Reynolds. I just want the job. Fine. Fine. Very impressive. No. Yes. How? Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it? We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check. I don't gamble, Mr Reynolds. I don't gamble. What for? You want me to check? It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right. Five. Five. What happens if I want to sneeze? I don't think so. Where's the magnet? You use two alternating, don't you? 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours. Stacks of 20. Rows of 5. Why four? And not three or five? I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond. Do you have a Salon Prive? I was at Beadles. No. Has he? Jack.Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight. Hey, you haven't changed your clothes! What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her. I'll tell you later. Rough life, Jack. I can't give you a lift back tonight. Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you. Don't worry, I won't report you! Hey Jack, join us. That bitch? No. Good call. Help yourself. Just girls. What are you drinking? Mostly people in the casino business. A few drug dealers. I don't know what that means. I'm talking about not rocking the boat. So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money. I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy. I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you? What are you, a cop? I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong. What the fuck are you talking about? I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that. I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax. Not bad. I have other interests, of course. Coming up to two years now. But I was away for six months. She's my baby. So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high. I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like. Have you got transport? Where do you live, Jack?Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here... How do you feel, Jack? She was a real asset. But what could I do? Thanks for the information. I can see. He's a good customer. Mr Tchai always likes to play at that table, and only with Bella. Why don't you take a break, Jack. Jack, you're not the usual type we get here. That hair will have to go. You can start Monday week. We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something. This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again. She's not in the gaming business is she? Girlfriend? First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you? We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished. This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does. Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden. Ever? For the database. It can be accessed by every casino in the country. We have the same system for punters. Let me just run through a few things. As a dealer you never gamble, not anywhere. We'll need your picture. I said good call. Good call. What makes you so sure? I make it six. How many aces are left? You won't. Not without permission. Not with your own cloth. Besides, your pockets will be stitched. Wipe your hands. Haven't you forgotten something? They've been tested. We do. Give me 365. Any exceptions? It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips. We check every four days. We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company. There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us. I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose. Where did you go to school? In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa. You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you? You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he? David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice. Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble. Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over. Crying? Why was she crying? Tell me. What do you want? IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION! WHAT? What was that crazy bitch said to him? There's a war on, man! People are being killed! Holy shit! What's the message? My light is blinking. Well, thank you. Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please? My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room? Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying... Righto! Not for me. Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track. Of course. But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast. He's a very crude man. Awake? What do you mean? You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo. He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him. Yes... It makes sense. Dobermans don't talk. Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California. Naked. Not where we operate. They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft. Rum and ice, please. Don't worry... ...and I'm actually the District Attorney from Ignoto County. Just another good American like yourself. Oh, my God!... I know. I'm a triple Scorpio. Las Vegas. Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer! Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel... I didn't think so. Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me. Hell, I forgot all about this beer. You want one? How about some ether? I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced? Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready? Never missed a plane yet. We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it. Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level. I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing. There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard... Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry! Inspector Rock will pay you. In cash. A thousand dollars on the ninth of every month. Do you think you can handle it? So do we, lady. FINISH THE FUCKING STORY! What happened?! What about the glands? Yes! Right! Extract of pineal! Why not? We should get some of that. Just eat a big handful and see what happens. I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought... Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body! Where'd you get this? I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again. I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid." Adrenochrome... What is this? It's gone too far. Me? Lucy is looking for you. They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs. We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around. What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it. They were all veterans. Like big lizards. What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s. Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too! Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice! Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops. Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited. They're actually nice people when you get to know them. Maybe we should take it easy tonight. That's good. You can't be subtle in this town. I felt like a Nazi, but it had to be done. Us? What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you? The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney. You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go. In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member. I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three. It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day. She's perfect for this gig. These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her. We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own. Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention. Lucy. WELL? What are your plans? You degenerate pig! What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred! You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately! There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife! Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police! Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves... Are you ready? Jesus. Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it! Don't touch it! Get back in that tub! How about a check? OK. But do me one last favor, will you. Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow. I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day. You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. What tape? You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble. Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot. What limes? Where'd you get that knife? That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her? He told me he was turning in early... No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason. What for? Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us. Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement. Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress. It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop. OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door. OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left. Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours. GO? Not much. Why? Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear. Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born? Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling. This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here. Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?! Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking. Why? Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job? Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people! They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up. That's good... What are you talking about? Not yet. I want to study its habits. No, no. Don't leave me! But what about our room? And the golf shoes? I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo. And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things! It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! Lacerda? Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close. How long do I have? You whore! God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig! And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism? Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. You scurvy shyster bastard! Watch your language! You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism! The medicine? Yes, it's right here. He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me. My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?! ...and we're chock full of that! We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture. Don't take any guff from these swine. Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars. I tell you, my man. This is the American Dream in action! We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right. Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me? Jesus! Did I say that? If so -- well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere. Because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose. He'd report us at once to some kind of outback Nazi law enforcement agency, and they'll run us down like dogs... No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you. One toke. You poor fool. Wait till you see those goddamn bats. The password is: "One Hand Washes The Other." The minute you hear that, you say "I fear nothing." You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name? Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it. The dope ring. You must know what's going on in this hotel. Why do you think we're here? What made you do it? Who paid you off? YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it. How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch. A nap won't help. I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights. I can't even remember. If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours. Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal. Why not? It was getting warm anyway. Of course, officer.You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again! You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum. That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy. He wanted the pineal gland. We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house. Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines. Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood! They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat. You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart. Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once... Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast! No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame! The airport is over there! What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there! How much is the lemon meringue pie? Two glasses of ice water with ice. Fuck the car. They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio. Alright, Alice... you'll be contacted by Inspector Rock. Arthur Rock. He'll be posing as a politician. I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with. Man I'll try about anything; but I'd never touch a pineal gland. ...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back... ...grow claws... bleeding warts. Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours... Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia. Some of what? I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me. He's one of these Satanism freaks. He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life. I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on. Never mind, it's absolutely pure. Hi, Lucy? Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what? No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out... You won't need much. Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome. Relax. Let me handle this. You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please. As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit. OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem. She really flipped over you. The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. I guess she figures you won. That phone message wasn't for me, was it? No, she's looking for you. Good work. They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that. Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps. Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line. Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary. Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons. ...and every one of them stacked naked... They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up... Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to. Read the newspapers. This is a fucking nightmare. Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood! I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them! Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon... As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline. I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out. Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra... It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless. We have to cut her loose. She's got two hundred dollars. And we can always call the cops up there in Montana, where she lives, and turn her in. NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her! You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in. NO! Stop talking like that. Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff. Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months. It's terrible. Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink. Plans? It can't be helped. This is Lucy. You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds." You're supposed to be in Vegas. We have a suite at the Flamingo. I was just about to leave for the airport. What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram? Who said anything about slicing you up? I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead. Nothing serious. The cops? You cheap honky sonofabitch... You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you? Fuck yes. I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it. Do it! I want to get HIGHER! BULLSHIT! Don't make me use this. Back the tape up. I need it again! Let it roll! Just as high as the fucker can go! And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME! I want that fucking radio! Whatever's right. Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off? I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on. Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound. Music! Turn it up. Put that tape on. Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her? They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert. Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes. That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same! That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman! Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk. Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose. Yeah... I thought we might need it... You drive! I think there's something wrong with me. Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator? Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back. When does this thing stop? Do they pay you to screw that bear? I want to leave fast. Can we make it? No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody! Yes. Leave the country. Tonight. I have to go. Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me? That's what gives me The Fear. I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear. Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep. Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working. We wandered into a fucking time capsule! Jesus creeping shit! What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now. Why what? To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars! How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs... I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes. You bastard! They'll never let us back in that place. I leave you alone for three minutes and you start waving that goddamn marlin spike around -- yelling about reptiles! You scared the shit out of those people! They were ready to call the cops. Hell, the only reason they gave us press passes was to get you out of there... Shoot it. That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room. I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda. I told him I knew what he was up to... He says he's a photographer! But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked! He knows we're onto him! If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators. Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid. You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning. Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us? Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out! The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry. I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right? What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help! Turn up the fucking music! My heart feels like an alligator! Volume! Clarity! Bass! We must have bass! What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies? Where's the medicine? My heart! Damn right! We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit. O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes. I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring. What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to? Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this? God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves. It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull. We're your friends. We're not like the others. "One toke over the line, sweet Jesus." Don't worry, it's all over now. Thank God for the decent people. Oh, and don't bother to make up the room. That way we won't have to risk another of these little incidents, will we? You and a lot of other people. One phone call every day. Just tell us what you've seen. Don't worry if it doesn't add up, that's our problem. In that case, maybe she can help. Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman. Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are! You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?Me!? You where the one... What? Where's Audrey? Who the hell are all these people? Great. See ya then. Hey, hey! I'm eating here! Big bites. That's cuz I'm married to you. Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera? What are you talking about? The east side is always faster. You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK. Oh yes he will. Only one way to find out. Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough. It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it. Lucy'd kill me if she knew. Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance. Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one. I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight. Didn't you tell me he left for the airport? You made a mistake. You okay? We know, Audrey. Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me. How long where you and dis guy goin' steady? That why you dumped him? Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle. I like that image.Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island! Have them sealed off. Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island? Get your people out of there or I will. Well your people are getting in the way of my job. You're fast. Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there. You gave them the tape? So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest. You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking... What are you suggesting? Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is. It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over. We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out. That's right. You're standing on it. Then you're perfect. Here's your radioactive sample. Study it. Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big. No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out. Yeah, you're the worm guy. We know. We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise. Follow me. Right. The worm guy. Can someone get those people off the beach? Dr. Niko Topopolosis? Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system. We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body. That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood. General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... We should be able to take him down. We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.Oh, just some insurance guy. You'd be surprised. Are you okay? If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape. Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did. How do you know? Circuits are overloaded. I was wrong. What are you doing here? So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time! The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting! Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy. ...he's pregnant. I got pretty close. Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening... I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature. When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change. I never lost my idealism. Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea? Most people don't. You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad. No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises... You're a reporter. That's what you always wanted to be, right? I'm happy for you. Really, I am. So you made it. Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been? I'll take them all. Make sure they find that nest before it's too late. Me too. I don't think so. More than that. I believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region. Oh, thank you. Is she always like this? Not for a long time, now. No. Perhaps I work too much. Oh, I'm not married. Hi. Nick Tatopoulos... No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it. It may be too late by then. These eggs will hatch very quickly. No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population. Um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. The blood I recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has. Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was injured and bled. When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out. You know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. He's just an animal. What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years. The radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. This creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur. Somebody must have seen it. But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there? That was a footprint. I was standing inside a footprint. What sample? They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them. It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent? The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means? Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm? Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field. You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions. Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here? It's Tatopoulos. Wait. Au revoir. I understand. Where are you? Hello? It's okay. I know her. I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong. How do I do that? Good idea. Three eggs. I thought there would be more. They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. What's with the chewing gum? Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion. Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it. Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific. Sure. So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military? How did you get all of this stuff into the country? Oh, my bags. I've checked them in. Why do you need that? Why are you telling this to me? Are you sure? How do you know? Oh. Sounds like a big company. Oh yeah, the insurance guy. Do I know you? Thanks.Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom? Yeah, me too, Keri. Oh, God... no... not Molly. What? Where is she? I'm not leaving without her. Where's Molly? She's not in her room... He found you, didn't he? I don't know. Why didn't you tell me? Any other psychotic relatives I should know about? Jason? Freddy Krueger? Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle? Now you're joking, right? You some kind of fugitive or something? I'm sorry, alright? It was just a stupid joke. Just forget it... Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends. Or what? You're gonna shoot me? I just went for a walk. It's no big deal. Nothing. You're twisted. To the bathroom. Can I do that alone or do you want to watch? My life is a living hell. Alright, I was wrong. There is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster. The dorms are only fifty feet away. You could practically see into my window. So, what difference does it make? I promise not to run off to Cancun. Well, Dad thinks it's okay. Okay, you win. I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms? I'm sixteen, Keri. I should be able to live wherever I want. What the -- You're so predictable. Better? Here, take my jacket. You look kind of cold. You saw that Michael Meyers display. You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that. Well, I'm not going until I talk to you. Then you come out here. Can I come in? I came to see you. Nah, I didn't tell her where I went. Why not? I borrowed it. Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday. Shelve the barf bag. It's the key to the main gate.I'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms... Keri, you all right? Can't it wait till Monday? I thought maybe we could dance... I'm very light of my feet. Oh, right. Sorry. Do we have to invite him to the wedding? So you're really Michael Meyers' sister? Never. You just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it. I can't believe this is happening. The serial killer? Who? You're right. It does sound strange. What? What are you looking at? Hey, you alright? A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice. Doesn't make it bad advice. The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free. This kid just wants his freedom. Still wants to move out? It's John, isn't it? You okay? You seem a little off. Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?You don't have to prove anything to her. Doubts? About what? That's a reasonable assumption. Most certainly. Why? I see. From where? To where? I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now. If I had seen you. By the way I'm sorry about your wife. They told me.I have to finish first. I'm completing the walk. I'm almost there. I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want. Then it'll have to wait until I finish. How serious is it? You should definitely have children. They're really special. Are you two planning kids? Nothing's going to happen. I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again. No it's not. I'll make it. You'd be visiting me at Nasa. It's what she asked for... It's what I'm going to do. I have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch. Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand. I have new dreams now. High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles. They're nasty. I'll kill you! That's enough. This is Indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you. No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance. Are you and your friends planning on driving soon? What are the odds? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation? What steps do we take now? Can it kill me? Twenty miles? I see. Just for curiosity sake that's all? No. How far in one attempt -- what's the farthest someone like myself could walk? Okay. You have? You do? I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar. Routine, I assure you. I just wanted to gage my health. Am I healthy? Pardon? The beach of Pacifica, California. Go to sleep Ellen. Yes. Why there? Where? Did you have a dream? I don't know. No it's not. He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker. He's never been there for me. I've always been alone. He's plastered. It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly. Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases. Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway. ... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway. I don't want us to be that way Ellen. Ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world -- You've just decided, is that right? You can't change your mind. I thought we both wanted the same things. Please tell me. No. But I want to take a walk with you. Walk with me? I will -- I promise. I do love you... very, very much. There's no reason. No. A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing. You're talking to me? What do you want from me? Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you? Yes... Yes I would. You know that. Yes. You don't think I love you? Is this going to be similar to the flower incident? I don't follow. What's that? That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune. What you have is a statement. It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving. The new store? Ellen? It's a special day isn't it? Have I forgotten something? Is this a special day? You thought I sent them? Yes? I'm not proving to her. I'm showing her. And I know I don't have to. I want to. I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can. About my love for her. I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts. And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them. Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death? Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pacifica, California. Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie. It must have been difficult. What did they ask? Okay nine. Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base. That's when Isaac came up. He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium. Everyone cheered. Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play. Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together. The end. Right. But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy. He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game. It came to the end of the game. It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game... Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands. 'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove. Who's telling this story? There was a boy named Isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... He went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove. Oh no... I'm not good at that. Very bad in fact... Your parents would want you to be in bed. I thought you were asleep. You'll probably be bigger than your brothers. Is that right? I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three. Are your parents home? Well, hello. By car right? Perhaps there's another route? Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand? Making the grand total? No more words. Until I touch the ocean with my hands... it's all just words. It's mine to risk. ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife? Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then? We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing. What, come on? Are they standing? I haven't been too punctual with the rent. Adelle told me, your writing is going well. The Crusader for social issues and all. I missed you Kris. ... The Grapes of Wrath. She never ate a slice. Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles... And you know what Kris? So I've been informed. Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her. I need to show her how much I love her Kris. I said, 'I would do anything for her'... and she didn't believe me. I said, 'I'd walk across the country for her'... she didn't believe me. She wasn't certain... I never really showed her. Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her. Pacifica, California -- it's a coastal city. I told you. ... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris. I always knew you had good instincts... Goodbye Kris. I'll see you when I get back. California. I'm walking there Kris. Tomorrow. California. Yes. No. No... I won't be here for a while. The store will be closed in the interim. Write from your heart. That's why the classics are great. To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things. How can you feel for dog food? The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you. Never have children. If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else. They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening. It has to be a full character's name. Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett... Pride and Prejudice. You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back. Did you tell him everything you wanted to? Did you do everything you could while he was here? You ever lose somebody Stephanie? I need your help. Do you have a car, Steph? What do your friends call you? Which hospital? Did you take me back? Where am I? May I ask you a question that might sound strange? Where did he go? You look so happy -- how long have you been married? I don't have kids. Oh, that's not mine. Good morning. What? Who are you? What do you mean? Confused. I'm not sure what to do now. I'm not sure what he wants for me. Hello. This isn't right. It's yours. Evening News?This is my only chance to get a watch like that. It would mean a lot to me and my family. Please take it. It really isn't that much. I really want that watch. No. I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that. I've always wanted a watch like that. We did a piece after your story ran in the New York Times. If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell. I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.What happened? Real rain? Are you alright? What is it? Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs. And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce. And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it. No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ... I really don't know. Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market. Wife wants him to get one of those new beds. "Changes." And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things. Did you hear about Bill Miller? I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town. You know what I mean by "changes"? I'm fine--but thank you. Oh, no thanks ... No it isn't. It's not in ME. THIS BEHAVIOR WILL STOP AT ONCE. BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS! YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER! You're not allowed to lie. Okay--that's enough! The basketball team? Very well ... Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges. Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children? Do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness? We prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. I don't think a lawyer will be necessary. Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall: Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta. You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this. BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Do you know that it's illegal? Did you do this? You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station. What do you mean!? Dan! Arrest them!"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see." What is it? What's outside of Pleasantville? And where's that? How'd you know how to put it out and all? How'd you know about the fire?Thanks ... I love you. ... It's a pretty short trip. I won't. Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ... Sure. Wait. No ... They won't be able to tell. Looks just like it did. Have you got any make up? It's okay. It's alright. I'm fine. Oh no ... I'm fine. No, I ... I was just ... worried about her. It can't be possible. We're in Pleasantville? What'll it be? I didn't say that. It's just that right now ... What I mean is ... Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately ... Lucky guess. Look, Biff ... I don't think it's a real good time for that right now ... You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ... I don't believe it. Oh God! Are we in that episode? But it could happen. C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ... Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her? Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too. You might even call it "love." Oh sure it is. But see that's just the point. It can't stop at once. Because it's in you. And you can't stop something that's in you. Well I don't think it's a circus. And I don't think they do either. Why am I out of order? I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you. I thought I was allowed to defend myself. See, I know you want it to stay "Pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like Silly ... or Sexy ... or Dangerous ... or Wild ... or Brief ... And every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them. Look at those faces back there. They're no different than you are. They just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ... Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win. It's like the basketball team. I think I've got something to say. It was accessible to everyone. Well--it was dark out ... Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer? Still doesn't make it right. Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want. Yes I do. Yes I did. I thought the books were blank? Look it doesn't matter. It's not important. Um ... Outside of Pleasantville. What? The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare. No, not that hedge. The other one. What color is that hedge of yours? Mr. Simpson ... Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell. Hello Mr. Simpson. And you're sure about this? You got the admissions letter. Honestly ... no. This thing works. We could go home right now. Are you sure? Oh, I don't know. Maybe ... ... it's not just the sex ... What? Yes. Wow. You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me? Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up. Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me? Well ... I just ... Can I ask you a question? That's great. ... Yeah. You're reading? Nothing. The pages filled in? Sure. It's fine. It's okay. Really? It seems so fattening. They don't have that kind of potential. I just don't think we have the right to ... They're happy like this. You have no right to do this. You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE. You can't do this, Jennifer. I WARNED you. What did you do to him? Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes. If you need anything, I'll be right over there. Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work. Jen please ... They don't notice that kind of thing. He won't notice anyway. It's in your closet. I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home. Jen, listen ... JENNIFER! What were you doing in a library? What? One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack. I don't think so. Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne and Betty Jean. As a matter of fact he does. Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team. To who? We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back. Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue. We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ... Owns the hardware store. We're supposed to be in school. Just take deep breaths. I don't believe this. I don't know ... It's not possible ... Is it possible? Oh God. You--you gotta get us out of here. I don't know. I'm not sure. Oh my God. Get lost! Forget it Jen, I've waited a year for this. No way. No you can't, Jen! It's a new TV. It doesn't work without a remote. Oh my God ... Oh my God ... Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs. Yeah. Every episode ever. Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty. What are you doing? I like it too. No I won't. I swear. I'm not sure. Sure ... It was a prop for the school play ... We'll just put up the top. Yeah ... You don't have rain either? Rain. They just grow like that? Hunh? Well it's big. And it's blue ... ... It's really really blue. Yeah. Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ... What? Yeah ... I guess. I don't know. Mmmmgh. Oh ... Right. ... Lover's Lane? Look, I probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ... Hi. Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ... No. You baked them for Whitey. Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey. Oh. Thanks, Margaret. Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon. Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon. Marmalade. Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter? Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have? There's worse places. I'm going on trial tomorrow? I don't know ... Three, four weeks. They weren't my memories. I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them. I'm sorry. I can't do that. So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ... Why don't you just take me back without it? Why? I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors. I'm going to leave now. I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that. No you're not. Why? I didn't do anything wrong. ... Only if they mean it. Look ... I had nothing to do with that. Look--it just sort of "happened" ... What do you mean? Oh--well ... Terrific. I'll talk to you then. Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow? Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ... Re-runs? Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ... Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ... I can't. ... Hi. COME BACK!!! WAIT A MINUTE!! Where are you going ... Don't get upset. Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now. My name's David. Because we don't belong! What the hell's going on! How much does it cost? Ooomph? No. McIntire's. Remember: "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's." McIntire's. Yeah ... ... Like Prince Charming. ... Her father. You know, we didn't call any TV repair. Yeah ... Sort of ... It's beautiful. You're gonna keep painting aren't you? It's okay. We'll get you a new one. Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ... What's wrong? Open it. It's an art book. I brought you something ... From the library. Hi. Yeah. I think you should try not to think about this anymore. Wow ... That's pretty good ... ... What's that? So they can have their hamburgers! Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway. Forget about that! Just listen to me ... What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point! Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ... Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes. Yeah ... Yeah ... Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early. Oh hi! Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along. Have you cooked the burgers? Do you have the lettuce? Listen to me! What? I understand. You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet. Yeah ... What's wrong? Sorry ... I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat ...Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous. Sleep well. This is TV pal. They don't fool around. Now Buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. And if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. Well, not forever--lemme think ... Five year sentence ... Carry the three ... That comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down. Much less than that. An hour and a half. How long do you think you've been here? I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ... Just gimme the damn remote! Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you? It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came. Because you're coming home. Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control? Hope you're proud of yourself. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!! OW! JUST GIMME THE GODDAMN REMOTE! EXCUSE ME? Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was. Where's the remote control I gave you? Oh no? Let me show you something! OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF! It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is? Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again? A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ... You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ... What do I MEAN! You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ... NOW! I want a word with you ... BUD. Excuse me? Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey. ... Those aren't your cookies Bud. I'll be honest with you Bud. I'm getting sorta concerned about what I'm seeing in some of these re-runs ... Bud--I thought you wanted to come home. What? So even though I can't make any promises, well--I figured if you asked me real nice--I might just be willing to talk about it again. Well c'mere, young fella. Hello there. Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ... I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed. Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know. I don't think I better talk about this right now. But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you. Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud. Why would I do that? Shh! Can't talk like that now. You're in ... You know ... ... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ... Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free. Sure. Big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show. Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it. That's right. McGinty's. What department store did they go to? Nice ... Nice ... Right. And how did she dress him? Well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh? I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend. We'll get you fixed up in no time. Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella. You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. Dream come true, hunh? A miracle. Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something. Oh sure. Big fan like yourself. It's the least I could do. Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him? Hey--who did Muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles? Gosh, I loved that show. Watched it for years. What's the rush? Well here I am. Yeah. TV busted? TV repair.Where are you gonna go? Okay--now you listen to me ... You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table. It goes away ... It'll go away. It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ... Sure you are. Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ... I was in a bowling-alley. All night? But your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about. Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys. ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here. That's IF she can learn to bake. Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought. Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home." Rain. Oh sure ... You bet. Betty ... Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say. No. Of course not. Thank you very much. ... How? Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do? One of those ... big beds? No. What? "Changes." Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ... Want some bridge mix?Yeah. Or like sprinklers in the summer ... Yeah. It does. But you can't go out there. You can't go out there. I don't know. It's alright. Let me see. It's alright. Wait ... No she's not. What? Isn't it great how she's resting like that? Here's my favorite. Bud brought it to me. Well ... Here's what it's s'posed to look like. Having kind of a tough time. Thanks. No, no ... Come on in. Oh, hi ... Oh, hello Betty. Just a little--You know. Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was? I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ... No, that's not it. I'll never be able to do that. Oh my Gosh, Bud ... Aren't you a little early? Oh, hi. Oh. Okay. I'll try that then. Really? Well don't you? Thanks. But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?" Christmastime. You know what I really like? Why? Oh ... Okay. ... But I really liked it. ... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ... No I know ... I know I do ... But it's always the same, you know? Grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... It never changes. It never gets any better or worse ... Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore. Oh--what's the point, Bud? There aren't any cheeseburgers. Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself. You know how when we close up, I close the register, then you lower the shades, then I turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors. Bud ... Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay. Yes. ... Yeah. Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ... There aren't any cheeseburgers. I'm so glad you're here. But you didn't come so I kept on wiping. Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ... Oh. Bud?The other one? Green. Yes. Hear your Dad got a new car. Hello Bud.Bye. No... I want to stay with you... Anij! If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play... Why not...? Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun? Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it. Chase me! No, I mean... Do machines ever play? But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like... Sometimes I do. For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's. Really? I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine. Don't you ever get tired? I know why. So people like us won't be afraid of you any more. Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do you like being a machine? I don't. My father told me I shouldn't talk to you. You're what? The artificial lifeform was right? Won't he rust? Can he breathe under water?I have to go home now. It is safer there. I will join you shortly. Tournel will take you the rest of the way... No one's ever asked me that before. Androids... don't have...fun. But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second... For what purpose? I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced... I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child. My legs are eighty-seven-point- two centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I... cannot imagine... the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet... But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt? A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet. Really. Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child... My power cells continually re- charge themselves. Perhaps, that is true. I aspire to be more than I am. I understand. I am better. There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now. I believe it is safe, sir. I'm showing fresh air behind this calcite formation, Captain... Another forty-three people reported taken, sir... Captain, I've activated transport inhibitors around the village... Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku? ... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence. Incomplete, I might add. It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain. Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills... And I do not believe I made a very good first impression. ... I am the personification of everything they have rejected. I believe the boy is... afraid... of me. I was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on Ba'ku children. My last memory is going into the hills, following a boy... 'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...' Yes... that looks like them. Captain, Geordi...?If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until... It is over. We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over... You're not going to launch anything until... I'll order Riker to turn around. That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation... Take me down. Let me talk to Picard. He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies... I know what Data means to Starfleet, Jean-Luc... but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet... I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation... Another time. Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk... There's nothing further to be gained from this... Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed. We are only moving six hundred people, Jean-Luc. It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would? Our best scientific minds already have. We can't find any other way to do this. The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations. With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve... I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him? On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that... Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners. There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions. The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings... The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution. I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council. That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation... You're looking well, Jean-Luc. Rested. Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out. I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out. You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data? Good luck. Dougherty out. All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail. I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team... Captain, I wasn't expecting you. We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed. Dougherty out. That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns... ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village... But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them. I thought it might begin the healing process. You've brought the Federation into the middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel their elders... just as they were once expelled. Except Ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated to parricide. This way! I should warn you... I've always been attracted to older women... How is it a woman like you never married? And don't tell me you "just haven't gotten around to it yet"... By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do. Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice... Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away... We can hold them off a long time... once we get there... But they will not make it easy to get there... When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible... ... an offlander? There's one thing I don't understand. In three hundred years...you never learned to swim? I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn. Seeing my home planet from space for the first time... A perfect moment? Will it? An apprentice for thirty years. We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here? The craftsmanship is extraordinary. You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be? But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't. In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me... There are days. Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down. Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well. I don't intend to let them. We've... just begun to. I suppose you're seventy-five. Don't panic... To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it. Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship... I don't like to leave questions unanswered. I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day... You have warp capability? If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened. The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill... My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive. We were under the impression they were being held against their will. If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now. To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you. No. Data doesn't breathe. Is it safe to move her? Will he live? Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship... Very funny... 'Yew-cheen chef-faw'... My collar size is exactly the same as it was at the Academy. Will the structure hold if we blast through? How many? Good. Let's begin to move these people out... I don't know. What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku... What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields... 'Just a few loose ends to tie up.' A ship, How about a passive radiation scan? Until this week, that young man probably never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks... It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you... From the mission... What's the last thing you remember, Data... You're aboard the Enterprise. Hello, Data... I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial... If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it. How many people would it take... before it becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million? We are betraying the principles upon which the Federation was founded... this is an attack on the very soul of the Federation. This will destroy the Ba'ku. Just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history. The Ba'ku. Then the Son'a can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do... Delay the procedure. Let my people look at the technology. There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be... Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago. Our partners are nothing more than petty thugs. A planet in Federation space... Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people? How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...? ... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world. I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council... Your "Briar Patch" turned out to be more hospitable than I expected. You're not finished here? In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic. ... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal... Understood. Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely... This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral... What kind of concerns? The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral... You have no idea what precipitated his behavior? Scan for lifesigns. What if he doesn't realize something's happening... Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf and Data on the surface... we'll need their help... If we could lure him away from the bridge... Do you know how to disable the injector? I'm not begging for my life. I'm begging for yours. There is still a way home, Gal'na. A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me. ... had regenerated. Implants bothering you? And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba'ku we were a threat... So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong. Fail-safe? Why would they fire at him without provocation? The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned. Do you know how they were damaged? When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment... Do you have everything you need from command? Are they...? I want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows. I'll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can join us. We're going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the Goren system. Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get... There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it... Go back to your quarters That's an order. Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours. Deck five. We're not going anywhere. So where are the 'environmental concerns' the Admiral was talking about? We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck... Who is it? 'Yew-cheen chef-faw.' ... so they need us to put out one more brush fire. Anyone remember when we used to be explorers? We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season... Ask them. You've not aged a day since then? No, we're here to... rescue them. Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi. I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready... Worf, you must hurry... Yes... yes, I... can hear you... We'll skip the court martial this time... Picard out. Slow to impulse. We're on our way. Is there any other way to disable the injector? Can you beam him off? Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf. We have to find shelter... Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations... You need a haircut, Commander. No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf. Picard to Crusher... Gorch? Debrief them again. Have you been in a fight, Commander? Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings? Transferring controls to manual. I'm not letting go of him. They're composers, Worf, from the nineteenth century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left... "A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word..." Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan? Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one... Prepare to enter the atmosphere... we'll use the ionospheric boundary to shake him... Beam him out! Make it so. Hmm? Oh, it's just something my mother used to... Come out, come out wherever you are... The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf... Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention. It's good to have you back, Worf. Slow to one-third. Take us in. Worf, what the hell are you doing here? Counselor? You have two days to become experts... Mister Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture Data. Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums... Say the greeting again...That's your expert opinion? Will that stop the tear? If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship. Full impulse. A photon torpedo. Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down? It's our only way out of here, Mister Nara. The purpose being I intend to shove it down the Son'a's throat. Eject the core. On screen. Why not? Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full thrusters. We're through running from these bastards. Remind me to lodge a protest... Yes, we do. You're relieved, Ensign. Take over at Ops. What's inside that nebula cluster? How long 'til they reach us? The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review. Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship... You must be planning on doing some hunting. Aye, sir. You Klingons never do anything small, do you... Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet... The only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region... Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey... ... and gorgonzolla cheese. Commander Riker... Deck ten. The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations. They need us to mediate some territorial dispute... All hands. Battle stations! Augh? What I need, I can't get from Doctor Crusher... Counselor, do you think it's possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake they've made? ... I'm not sleeping well... Both. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis... Or you could try lying down. But it's comfortable. Got a minute? I... need a little counseling. First time for everything. Do I... lie down... or what? If that's true, they're a dying race. It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating... What you're doing to my neck... You haven't done that in a long time... Good question. You're in luck... it says here they've taken women from several races as indentured servants. Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels... Wine, women and song. I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology... Why was Data assigned?Negative. He's established a security field around the control room... One. It's Ru'afo. All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line. Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock onto them. The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers... Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla... Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...? Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned... No, sir. It is a gorch. No, sir... The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire! Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance... if we don't release him, he may destroy both vessels... No, sir. I haven't had a chance to meet all the new crew members since I've been back... Scanners are off line! He's activated a transport inhibitor. Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics... Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out... Sir? He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach. Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface... I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down... Captain...Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a cup of coffee. Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick. S'matter with you? You look like you're fading. You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano. Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to scratch that thing, huh?Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch! ...Not until I get a little something to remember you by. Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving... All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then. Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes. That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help. Uh-huh. I was worried about you. Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted? If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest. Dom Wooganowski. Duh. You stole her from me. Now I want her back. People get hurt that way. You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels! The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that. Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will. Why's that? Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous? You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates. You know, clean the pipes. Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go. Mints? Car clean? Plenty of gas? Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine? Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water. Well? What are you waiting for? No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this. Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary! Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years. Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention. Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man. You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that? Well then you've got to call her, man. The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up. No You mean...? Huh? But why did Healy? What? Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine. What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy? Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you! Well... at least now you know. Hey, look on the bright side -- He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down. Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence. Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk. I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing. You're kidding? What did they say? So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up? What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her? Why not? Well why don't you look her up? I mean since then. Whatever happened to Mary? Mary again. Never? Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone? I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you. Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million? Loser? You? I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo. You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American. I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant. Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls? Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote. Gay? He said you were gay?We're in love with your roommate. No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some! You got a brew? Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals... ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.' 'That right? Call you back. You said it, mister. I gotta go. The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did. I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better. Ahh. I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages. Oh yeah. Yep. Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about. Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment. Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there? Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you? Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting? Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break. I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy. This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer? Here, just have one of these then. Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you. What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead. Tell Bill to get the fuck off! Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right? Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks. Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act. Very nice. Big time. Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend. Thanks. Fucking Sully! Look at you! I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us. Who the hell's Woogie? Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP. No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right? Urrggghh... How's my stomach taste, she says. Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog. You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants? Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her. Fuck!! Nah, really, it was moronic. No, forget it, it was stupid. Mary ah, forget it. Well, I'll see ya. Yeah... I guess this is it, huh? Wow. I thought I was the only one. -- Love story of our time. Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it. Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude. No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it. Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks. Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies... You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling... Lint? And it doesn't cramp your style? That grandmother of yours -- she's really something. When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism. That...? Vestibule. Deco. What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket? A surprise? The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner? Fine. Fine. Great. Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now? Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me. Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run. That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff. Well it's more of an enclosure really. -- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and -- The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with. You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus. I work with retards. I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby. Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card. Some buildings I'm working on. It's right there on your golf bag. I already know it, Mary. Pat Healy. Same here again. Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu. Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway. Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu. Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place. Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins. I'm gonna get a soda, you want one? Thanks. A girl after your own heart, Ted. Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself. What? I don't know what you're talking about. That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy. Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn. Oh Christ... poor dog. That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself! Turn her over to a stalker. Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it. What do you mean 'why'? Hey, hey, hey! Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna. You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too. Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan. It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal. I said buttplug. She's heinous. Rollerpig? Are you nuts? Good good. Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton. Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai. Oh, uh, I resigned. You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy! Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project? Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it. Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you? Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet. Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget. Four kids, three different guys. Nope. Never been. But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds. I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad. Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years. That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school? Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something. I think your life's about to change. I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend. I get one hundred a day plus expenses. Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work. Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case? You want her dead, don't you? She's blackmailing you, right? Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up? I don't buy it. Don't play games with me, Ted. All you want is a phone number? Any idea where I might start looking? So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school. Oh... Sully. You were following us? Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out? You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture. You crossed the line, man. You little fuck. Sully...! What the fuck happened here?! Ho-ly shit. That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him? How many is that? Fucking sickening. Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes. Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line! Nice. How'd you manage that one? And you met Mary how? Bullshit! But... but you knew people at Harvard. What do you mean? You what? That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit? Maybe this'll jog your memory. Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?! Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker? Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there. No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower. Do you know the... soccer stadium? Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile? Nice smokescreen, isn't it? Well, I'll tell her I ran into you. Among others. You bet. Yes yes, I did get my degree up there. Mainly I work out of Boston. Same here.You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty. How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that? Is it the frank or the beans? She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what to do. Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this! OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! It? Oh it. All right, these things happen, let me have a look. It's not the end of the world. You got what stuck? What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something? Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?! Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie. Yeah? What do you want?Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things. But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did. Why didn't you just tell her the truth? Dumbshit. The sawbones? So where the hell are you, Healy? You found my car?! Who the fuck is it to you? Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore. Am I? No I can't. Healy, what I just tell you? Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too. Nineteen months I been sober. Relax, he just ate. Take it easy, that's Bill. Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore. What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence. I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work. Stalker, huh? You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough? Here's the info you asked for. You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser. Healy you dog!No, I just meant... The thing's kind of heavy. I'll try to be more careful. What? I guess. Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track? Jeez, I didn't catch it. Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it. The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony... Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything. But but you're married. You have kids a great wife. Dom? What are you? Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun! Jesus Christ you're right. Huh. I'm usually too tired to be. No. Pipes? What are you talking about? Hm? Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash. Check. Got cash. Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man. Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed. She's even more beautiful than I remember. I don't know what to say. Fuck me. Let's go home. And this adversely affects me how...? Shoot. How the hell did you get here anyway? Yeah feels like it. I am? Fuck calling her. I'm going down there. That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai. Uh-huh. Well think about it. My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe! Mary's a babe! Amen to that. Never met him. Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health... I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment. Wait a second, I never told you that. What's so funny? I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world. What's that, Dom? What's the bright side? That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short. And you think he could find out her number for me? His mother? I don't know about this, Dom. They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time. I also called Unsolved Mysteries. I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed. Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single. Yeah, right. I don't know. I told you, her family moved to Miami. Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years. Well once. Mary. Nah. It must be great with a wife like that. Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion? What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser. Good-looking? What's he like? Come on, that wouldn't make me gay. Yeah, but he was successful. He implied it. A convention? How'd you see her at a convention? Mary. Bob, do you remember Mary? Out getting coffee. It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair. Oh come on, why would I lie? Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser. Who? Who? Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal? I'm talking about the letter, asshole. Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you? Your turn? You're a sick man, you know that? What?! You're calling me a stalker? Do what? Answer the question, shitball. You fucked me, man? Why would you do that? Surprised? Mary's a mail-order bride? Japan? What's she doing in Japan? Oh. I thought That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her. All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out. The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes. But you said she was a sparkplug...? Well I think you're right, I should look her up. Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me. Jai alai? Miami? What are you doing? Uh, that's okay. Thanks, Healy. Good work. It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought... She's in a wheelchair?! Oh my. Three different guys? Huh? So she's married? Mary's a little chubby, huh? No, not at all. So she hasn't changed? So you found Mary? Really? Very, very? You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses. Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing. I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine. You can't be serious. No. No. You don't buy what? I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador. Well, I know you're busy... She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then. Uh-huh. Huh. That sounds great. Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs. How do you guarantee that? I'd go with the seven. I see where you're going. The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V. 'That right? Good for you. Hm? Nah. I'm... I'm nothing. That must make it tough. No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight. Really? But but what about Steve? I... I just want you to be happy, Mary. What what are you doing here? You're Woogie? Okay. Mary, come on... I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again. Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you. Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought -- Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know -- Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy? Yeah, sure. All right, let's go. Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure. Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks. Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead. Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect. What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single? We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot. Trying to be. Well... why don't you move back? Yeah? Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers. You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver. I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat. That's more like it. Two more nitrate-sicles please. Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady. What are you? No short game. Jeez, Mary... I'm... Now by killer, you mean...? Sure. Hm? You look great. Hey. Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day. Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times? Oh... are you... ? Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson. Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down. No, it was a good thing. I mean, good in that it was very quick. He's dead. Really? I never got a message. Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars. Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda. You asshole, what are you -- Mary! Is that you? You betcha! Just a minute. Oh yeah. Oh. Okay. I gotcha. Hi, Mary. I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year. Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb. Huh? A real Clydesdale, huh Warren? No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school. No, it's an old football injury. Oh yeah. Fine. No, that's really unneces -- I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan. One guess. I think a little of both. What?! No please, sir -- Shhhhhh! It. I, uh... I got it stuck. I wish. I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball. Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom. No, no, please! What do you mean? Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us. Oh. Oh, that's a good one. No! I was pissing! No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning. I wasn't trying -- Oh God. Okay. So is that a yes or a no? Uh-huh. It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want. Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me. So what's up? See you, Warren. See you, Warren. I'm gonna take a rain check. How are you doing, Warren? Jesus, I think her brother spotted me. We're here, Warren. You wanna get off? I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it? Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve? Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit. What? Hey, this is a pretty nice place. I never said that. Four. That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch! Why you son of a -- What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war! Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up. Friend. Baseball bat. Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back. ...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn. I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else. My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas. I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year? Estadio Olimpico -- please! I'm a phony -- just like you, man. You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her. Who? Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid. You know, I really should take your card. I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style? Did you build the Estadio Olympico? Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours? Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids. You mean him. Kim and I are close friends! Did you study under Kim Greene? Harvard? Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there? Pleasure to meet you, Patrick. Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks. Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there. Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off. Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay. I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on. Mary, the man's a killer. I think you'd better sit down. Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy. Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit. I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there. I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy. Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus. That's what you've been looking for -- a farter? Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him? You don't think they're too big? What's up, Doc? Where would I have seen your work? Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?Right...because every ant's important! No -- an individual ! Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca... You know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! Look at Z! He started as a worker -- then he became a soldier! Z? Our Z? The little guy made it! No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans. Sorry I got you in trouble. But listen, you can share my rations. Nobody told me digging was so much fun! You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers -- I'm new...I was born yesterday. No, sir! That's correct, sir! I...I have no idea, sir. Thank you, sir. Oh, no, sir! Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir. You heard the ant -- DIG!!! Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there. And come right back after the inspection! Yeah, I know. Wear this. Maybe I'll get lucky. You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you... Will you introduce me to some worker girls? I can't think of any. It's a sign that you're crazy! Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is? Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by accident! Well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper. Time to cut a rug, Z! Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions. And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves. Go with the flow. Z, we've known each other a long time, right? Who said there was a girl for you? I was talking about a girl for me. Don't you want your aphid beer? Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes. I don't know what you're talking about, Z. I'll be back.This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing? Thank goodness. Breaktime. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Sorry Azteca. Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt! Alley oop! Shouldn't we be wearing gloves? I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene? Boy am I hungry. I'm so hungry I'm seeing double. It looks like there's two million ants in here. When's lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after? I mean, I've got the whole package, right? A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids. I know it's crazy, but -- I can't just leave. Don't argue with me. If I've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world. Or beans. Something like that. Anyway, I've got to warn the others . Bala, that -- that lake we found -- I think the tunnel's right underneath it! -- Formica's going to flood the colony !!! That's what he meant when said there were too many ants! Why do they have you tied up here? Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday. Well, to be honest, I just liked having it. Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else... Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my middle name is .985, but I don't tell people. Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night. So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night? Forget it. You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia". Yes? Let's dig in! We've found it! Insectopia ! Look at all this food' Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar. The night we danced. So what makes you so special? And only you can become a Queen? Look. How many other Princesses are there? Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're not going to rescue you ? Hlllllllp! Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around. Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just -- This lake is huge! And so close to the colony! Think of the vacation potential! Want a list? Come on -- it's gone! What are the chances of that happening again? I ruined your life? Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was happily miserable . Water...water -- oh, you already said that. I've got a name . It's Z . Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source... that it exists. Now you follow the yellow egg... That direction. Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options... You go back. Me, I'm going to Insectopia. Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica? Oh come on, you're the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker! Well I guess that makes us even. Look around, sweetheart. But can there be a society composed of just two ants? Theoretically, yes. But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it? Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot? Excuse me, I -- Pardon me -- And they call them social insects. Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals. How should I know ? -- At the worker bar ! You were pretty hot to trot then! That's not what you said the other night -- Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you. No...as a matter of fact... Divinely? Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it -- Oh...oh well then, one more won't matter. Ah, yes. Well, charmed, I'm sure. So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero? And you are...? Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am. Wait! When can I see you again? Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time. Are you crazy? This guy's built like a pebble! You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays -- You -- you think I'm right? Why should everyone dance the same way? It's as exciting as watching fungus grow. Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up -- The palace, hunh? I bet those royals really live it up. Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding -- So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before? What a bunch of losers. Mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system -- Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!! Hang in there, buddy! You can make it! Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere! No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks. Barbatus! Barbatus? BARBATUS! You -- you saved my life! Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home. So we're going back for more armor, right? I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?! Well, what exactly does our platoon do? Serve beverages? Process paperwork? Attack? But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile! Yeah. Well -- no. She's kind of playing hard to get. As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable. So, what's on the schedule? A brisk walk? a foraging expedition? I just joined up. But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership! Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore -- Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse -- Oh, of course -- Oh, hey, that's great, I think I see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting. Good luck with the hallucinations. Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"? ...Not enough food? Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony. So...you two are in love? Engaged? As in you're getting married? Well, I generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back. So, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think Princess Bala likes men in uniform? ONE TO NOTHING! Royal victory party? Will...will Princess Bala be there? No -- you -- you don't understand! Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush. Lays it on a little thick, doesn't he? If you ask me, he's one giant bore. But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love. ...Ants... Why are we so successful? ...I should? I feel...isolated. Different. I've got abandonment issues. My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention. I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight. Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker. But I don't have any other options. I was assigned to trade school when I was just a grub . The whole system just...makes me feel... insignificant . Yeah, but I hate drowning more! Now dig ! What do I do? You're a real buddy. You bet! They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you! Well I'm gonna start doing things for you... You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you! What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- bingo ! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content! Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign! I'm not in the mood. Even when they're off work, they follow orders. Hey, did you hear what he said?! Weaver, I'm an insect, not a liquid. Of course. You were born two seconds after me. I can't help it. I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature. Call me crazy. Weaver, they're career girls. They're obsessed with digging. No, I'll probably never meet the girl for me. Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers. You soldiers get all the glory. Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them. Did you see that? How he gave you the beers, not me? I'm telling you, he's got something against workers. We declared war again? Are you scared?I will. Well, good luck with the job. You grown. Well, if you want my opinion... You think she sure 'nough your sister? She gone like they say? That girl...You know, Beloved... You think I should stop by? Think she'd welcome it? Your mother all right? They treating you right over at the Bodwins? You on your way home? Well, is it now? How you getting along? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Tell me something, Stamp. Tell me this one thing. How much is a nigger supposed to take? Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump. She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me. Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl... Leave off.. You don't know what I think. Jesus. What yard? When who- I don't want to know. There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me. Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub. They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth.. Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free? I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder. You remember your price, Stamp? Oh yeah. I got big plans. Just me. Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell. For what? If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow... What, baby? Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now. Don't you die on me!! This is Baby Suggs quilt. Is that what you planning!? You got to get up from here, girl. Devil's confusion. What's this I hear about you not getting out of bed? I saw Denver. She tell you? Yeah. Look bad? Sethe?We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle? Aw, Baby. You still know. You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right. You punishing Him, ain't you? You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood? You saying nothing counts? You saying whitefolks won. That what you saying? You blaming God. That what you're doing? Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what? You getting into bed to think about yellow? What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here. But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.

This is our concern, Dude. Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done. Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands. Her life is in your hands. Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give. They called about eighty minutes ago. They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5. They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only. What happened to your jaw? Well Dude, we just don't know. He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion. Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money. We've had some terrible news. Mr. Lebowski is in seclusion in the West Wing. Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude. Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.I got eighteen dollars, Dude. Your phone's ringing, Dude. Where you going, Dude?

Sure Allan, I'll be there. Hiya Allan. But I guess she told Dieter. Where'd she been? Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for. Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax-- No, man, nothing is fucked here-- Shit. Oh, man, don't say that.. Uh-huh.

That some kind of Eastern thing? Ahh, not so good, man. Okay, Jackie, done. I like the way you do business. Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers. He lives in North Hollywood, on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger. A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure your goons'll be able to get it off him, mean he's only fifteen and he's flunking social studies. So if you'll just write me a check for my ten per cent. . . of half a million. . . fifty grand. Does the Pope shit in the woods? Yeah, well, right man, there are many facets to this, uh, you know, many interested parties. If I can find your money, man-- what's in it for the Dude? But she hasn't run off, she's been-- I thought you might know, man. Uh-huh. Well, I still jerk off manually. On you, maybe. Which one was Logjammin'? White Russian, thanks.

It's just-- Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat. He thought I had your father's money, so he got me out of the way while he looked for it. Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee. Oh, you know, the usual. Bowl. Drive around. The occasional acid flashback. Bunch of assholes. And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately. Yeah. Roadie for Metallica. Speed of Sound Tour. And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly. Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven? I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement. Well, uh. . . Not much to tell. Maude?

You might learn something. Now I got-- I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all. No it's fine, really, uh-- That's really thoughtful but I-- Oh that's okay, I hardly even-- Yeah, but what about-- A hundred. Well--sure, I could do that-- Yeah, but my- Shit yeah, the achievers. He fixes the cable? Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua? Oh, no. You mean coitus? I was talking about my rug. Excuse me? Right, but let me explain something about that rug-- Huh? "Johnson"? Oh yeah? Is that what that's a picture of? You're a fuck, Walter! What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything! What the fuck were you talking about?! What about that shit about Vietnam! You make everything a fucking travesty! Goddamnit Walter! You fucking asshole! Walter-- Well can we-- The Dude, actually. Is what, uh. Wha. . . Donny-- Wha. Then what's... They shot Donny! Hy God! They shot him, Walter! Come on, Walter!. Hey, cool it Walter. Listen, pal, there never was any money. The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him. Hey, cool it Walter. Yeah. Uh-huh. We're sorry, man. We're really sorry. Walter, you fuck! He can't walk, Walter! WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE! HE'S CRIPPLED! PUT HIM DOWN! You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear. All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me. You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about. It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing. Taking care of her fucking dog. Going to her fucking synagogue. You're living in the fucking past. This driveway. And you were divorced five fucking years ago. Yeah, and you were-- You're fucking Polish Catholic-- Walter, come off it. You're not even fucking Jewish, you're-- Huh? Shit yeah! His million bucks was never in it, man! There was no money in that briefcase! He was hoping they'd kill her! You throw out a ringer for a ringer! I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man! He's had enough! He no longer digs her! It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks? I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back. I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off. And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything. Huh? WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA! COME PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM! THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to-- It is a fucking emergency. Huh? Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up-- Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone. Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency. I'm not-- And the fucking money! Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter! We know it's his fucking homework, Walter! Where's the fucking money, you little brat? Is the car out front yours? Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man! Look, man, did you-- Fuck me, man! That kid's already spent all the money! Uh. No. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what? Yeah. Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers? Who the fuck is that? The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose. Fuck your sympathy! I don't need your sympathy, man, I need my fucking Johnson! Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot! What're you, a fucking park ranger now? Yeah. They kept saying they believe in nothing. They're nihilists. This whole fucking thing--I could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug. That makes me feel all warm inside. Yeah, thanks Walter. That gives me a very secure feeling. Thanks Walter. I figure my only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me before the Germans can cut my dick off. All right, I'm leaving. I'm sorry ma'am. What about the toe? They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me-- But Walter-- Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna-- The nail polish, Walter. Whose toe was it, Walter? Aw, fuck it. It's been stolen, Walter! You fucking know it's been stolen! You don't know, Walter? You seem to know the answer to everything else! "Our" car, Walter? Walter-- But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off! They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna-- That's it. I'm out of here. Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski? Who gives a shit, Walter? What about that poor woman? What do we tell-- Walter-- Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski? No, Walter! I said I thought she kidnapped herself! You're the one who's so fucking certain-- Huh? The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman-- What the fuck is that supposed to mean? What the fuck're we gonna tell Lebowski? Walter, please-- Uzi? What the fuck? Walter! Fuck that! I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron. I'm throwing the money, Walter! We're not fucking around! Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter! Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it! That's the beauty of it Walter! We throw the money out of the moving car! There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car! FUCK. Yeah. That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly. That's a Swiss fucking watch. Terrific, Walter. But you haven't told me how we get her back. Where is she? Shutup, Walter! Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here. We're screwed now! We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter! They hung up, Walter! You fucked it up! You fucked it up! Her life was in our hands! Oh shit. Walter. Yes you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, Walter-- We? What the fuck we? You said you just wanted to come along-- Walter--what the fuck are you thinking? Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies-- Agh-- What the hell is this? The what? It's your roll. It's your roll-- Walter, face it, there isn't any connection. It's your roll. I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter. It's all a goddamn fake. Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit. And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say-- I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless. I mean she probably kidnapped herself. I told him if it was during league play-- ...They gave Dude a beeper, so whenever these guys call-- Yeah. Twenty grand. And of course I still keep the rug. Huh. Huh? Yeah? Wavin' a gun around?! Well, just take 't easy, man. Just, just take it easy, Walter. You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole. No, you're not wrong-- He's fragile, man! He's very fragile! And you know Smokey has emotional problems! Walter, you can't do that. These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector. Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away. Hey Walter-- Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey. So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game. Hey man-- Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it? You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling? What the fuck are you-- What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier? Huh? You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that? Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy-- Yeah, but-- No, but-- So who-- Walter, he peed on my rug-- Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my-- This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I can't go give him a bill so what the fuck are you talking about? What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about? What's your point, Walter? Yeah man, it really tied the room together-- Huh? No, she, she hit me right here. Friends like these, huh Gary. Another Caucasian, Gary. Dude. Hey, just tell me where the fuck you want us to go. Yeah. Dude here. Yeah? Dude the Bagman. Where do you want us to go? Dude here. Shit! It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look. Help me put him back in his chair. Walter! Well. . . yeah. We know the briefcase was empty, man. We know you kept the million bucks yourself. Where's the money, Lebowski? Well, okay, if you've already made out the check. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside. Well sure, look at it! Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir? I'll tell you what I'm blathering about! I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself! I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know? C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money-- Well we--I don't-- Fuckin' A. 'Scuse me? Mind if I smoke a jay? Sure. That and a pair of testicles. I don't know, sir. Dude. Ah fuck it. No, look. I do mind. The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man. I mean, if your wife owes-- Is this a--what day is this? Employed? Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski; you're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or Duder. His Dudeness. Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing-- Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just-- Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug-- You mean, did you personally come and pee on my-- So you know they were trying to piss on your rug-- Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to-- Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-You monsters! Put me down, you son of a bitch! All right, get out. Both of you. Well? Aren't you? Well, you have your story, I have mine. I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it. Well, she's back. No thanks to you. Brandt, give him the envelope. No. No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me. What in God's holy name are you blathering about? WHAT?! They did not receive the money, you nitwit! They did not receive the goddamn money. HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR HANDS! Where's my goddamn money, you bum?! Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry. Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life. Are you surprised at my tears, sir? Bunny. Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man? Huh? It's funny. I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome. I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs. What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski? Sure! Fuck it! That's your answer! Tattoo it on your forehead! Your answer to everything! My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame. I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can. But I do work, so if you don't mind-- You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday. Are you employed, sir? You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski? Hello! Hello! So every time--I just want to understand this, sir-- every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city, I have to compensate the-- Hello! Do you speak English? Parla usted Inglese? I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug? Did I urinate on your rug? I'll say it again, all right? You told Brandt. He told me. I know what happened. Yes? Yes? You told Brandt on the phone, he told me. So where do I fit in? Stay away from me! You bullies! You and these women! You won't leave a man his fucking balls! You're bullies! Cowards, both of you! Stay away from me, mister! I said out. Now. Who the hell is he?ANTI-SEMITE! Show me what you got. Nihilist. Dipshit with a nine-toed woman. Come and get it. Fucking nihilist. Come and get it.

Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank. This is not a worthy-- Shut the fuck up, Donny. We'll, uh, brace the kid--he'll be a pushover. We'll get that fucking money, if he hasn't spent it already. Million fucking clams. And yes, we'll be near the, uh--some burgers, some beers, a few laughs. Our fucking troubles are over, Dude. What have you. We'll, uh-- Shut the fuck up, Donny. This kid is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his father is--are you ready for this?-- Arthur Digby Sellers. You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude-- Am I wrong? Are you gonna split hairs? Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration! Fucking Germans. Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis. Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny. Where's your car, Dude? Really, Dude, you surprise me. They're not gonna kill shit. They're not gonna do shit. What can they do? Fuckin' amateurs. And meanwhile, look at the bottom line. Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars? Am I wrong? Kill that poor woman. Went alright. Dude's car got a little dinged up-- I'm shomer shabbas. WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT! I told that kraut a fucking thousand times I don't roll on shabbas. Saturday!

Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov! That fucking bitch! Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit. Shut the fuck up, Donny. YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT! This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude. Huh? So you have no frame of reference, Donny. You're like a child who wanders in in the middle of a movie and wants to know-- Were you listening to the Dude's story? Were you listening to the story, Donny? Shit Dude, I'm sorry-- Dude, I'm sorry-- Dude, I'm--it was an accident! Dude! Dude, I'm sorry! JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS! We're scattering the fucking ashes! A hundred and eighty dollars?! Walter Sobchak. Hurry Dude. I'd go but I'm pumping blood. Might pass out. Call the medics, Dude. It's a heart attack. There weren't any shots. No Dude. What's mine is mine. AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK! Fuck you. Fuck the three of you. That's fuckin' combat. The man in the black pyjamas, Dude. Worthy fuckin' adversary. I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk. I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank. Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.

What do you think happens when you get divorced? You turn in your library card? Get a new driver's license? Stop being Jewish? You know this! What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude! What the fuck are you talking about? I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death-- Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency? Yeah? What's your point, Dude? Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh. Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls-- I understand. That's why I picked up the phone. Erev shabbas. I can't drive. I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency. I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas. Dude? And the fucking money. And we know that this is your homework, Larry. You're going to enter a world of pain, son. We know that this is your homework. We know you stole a car-- Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard of Vietnam? Is this your homework, Larry? Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry? Dude, please!. . . Is this your homework, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry? Hardly Dude, a new 'vette? The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options. Wait in the car, Donny. Yeah, go figure. Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the. And yet his son is a fucking dunce. Not exactly a lightweight. The bulk of the series. Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude. All but one man died? There at Bitter Creek? Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude? Huh? Near the In-and-Out Burger-- He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger-- --We're sympathizing here, Dude-- No, I'm-- And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either. Nihilists! Jesus. Huh? Now Dude-- Dude-- Not if I have anything to say about it. Now that is ridiculous, Dude. No one is going to cut your dick off. Don't run away from this, Dude! Goddamnit, this affects all of us! Lady, I got buddies who died face- down in the muck so you and I could enjoy this family restaurant! FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE! Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude. So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes-- I'll get you a toe by this afternoon--with nail polish. These fucking amateurs. They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit our- selves with fear. Jesus Christ. My point is-- You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me. Fine, Dude. As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe-- How the fuck should I know? I do know that nothing about it indicates-- That wasn't her toe. Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude-- Hmm. Well, we were in a handicapped spot. It, uh, it was probably towed. And what do they got, Dude? My dirty undies. My fucking whites--Say, where is the car? Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here? Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman." For Christ's sake, Dude. Saturday is shabbas. Jewish day of rest. Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll! C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get sick of her little game and, you know, wander back-- I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling? That's right, Dude, 1 % certain-- What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude. You said so yourself-- Huh? Oh, him, yeah. Well I don't see, um-- what exactly is the problem? Aitz chaim he, Dude. As the ex used to say. You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked! Your wheel! At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out! I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him! The uzi! Your wheel, Dude! I'm rolling out! Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Here's the bridge-- The bridge is coming up! Gimme the ringer, Dude! Chop-chop! Wooden bridge, huh? We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan. Huh? What'd he say? Where's the hand- off? Thaaat's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity. If the plan gets too complex something always goes wrong. If there's one thing I learned in Nam-- ...Huh? That's the simple part, Dude. When we make the handoff, I grab the guy and beat it out of him. Yeah. So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh. Okay Dude. Have it your way. Ya see? Nothing is fucked up here, Dude. Nothing is fucked. These guys are fucking amateurs-- Dude, nothing is fucked. Come on. You're being very unDude. They'll call back. Look, she kidnapped her-- Easy, Dude. What the fuck is going on there? It is a fucking game. You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself-- My point, Dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. Am I wrong? Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking. I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand-- Thaaaat's right, Dude. The weight. The ringer can't look empty. My dirty undies. Laundry, Dude. The whites. The ringer! The ringer, Dude! Have they called yet? The fucking point is-- Have it your way. The point is-- Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude. Those rich fucks! This whole fucking thing-- I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck so that this fucking strumpet-- That...fucking...bitch! Huh? What if it's during a game? Just for making the hand-off? Anyway. How much they offer you? When he moved down to Venice he had to go door-to-door to tell everyone he's a pederast. The man is a sex offender. With a record. Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old. Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude. Calmer than you are. I'm perfectly calm, Dude. That's your answer to everything, Dude. And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind. Okay then. We play Quintana and O'Brien next week. They'll be pushovers. Am I wrong! Huh. I did not know that. Well, it's water under the bridge. And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong? You mean--beyond pacifism? You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point. Not in Nam, of course-- MARK IT ZERO! Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain. Smokey my friend, you're entering a world of pain. This is a league game. This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong? Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line! First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers. You can't board it. It gets upset, its hair falls out. What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer. He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude. I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii. Huh? Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture. State of Israel. If you will it, Dude, it is no-- Theodore Herzel. Way to go, Dude. If you will it, it is no dream. Donny! Please! Okay. That, uh. Am I wrong! Jeff Lebowski. Come on. This other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug. Am I wrong? What the fuck are you-- What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue! I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude. Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American. Please. Forget it, Donny. You're out of your element. Huh? No! What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here-- There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason-- This was a valued, uh. This was, uh-- Shit, sorry man. Oh, shit. This guy fucking walks. I've never been more certain of anything in my life! Let me tell you something else. I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy is a fake. A fucking goldbricker. Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire! I'll tell you who I am! I'm the guy who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY GOLDBRICKING ASS! This is a league game, Smokey! YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!! A world of pain. Am I wrong!? This is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules. Excuse me! Mark it zero. Next frame. Over the line, Smokey! I'm sorry. That's a foul. Smokey Huh?Yes, heh-- Heh-heh-- One--oh! Heh-heh. You never went to college? --without the means for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski has committed to sending all of them to college. They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the-- No, they-- These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak-- Wonderful woman. We were very-- And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity. Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes. And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California. Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs. Reagan on the left, taken when-- That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when-- That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year! Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially-- That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh. Please! Please! Please, feel free to inspect them. And this is the study. You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.Whistler, I -- No, we can treat the wounds -- Don't try to talk -- China Town. I need more serum. What's all this? Don't even start, old man. Get in. You�re leaving. It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her. Stupidity. Just do it, old man. She hasn't turned yet. You can help her. She's been bitten. Whistler! It's because I'm human that I can do this. You don't have a few minutes, Frost. Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. Who dies first? Frost!!! You're not going anywhere. Pass. You're wrong. Maybe I don't see it that way. I don't buy it. How can you be out here? But I just got here -- How do I stop it? "The Blood Tide". Who is LaMagra? I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. You're blind -- For them. But for me -- I can't -- I won't be able to stop -- No -- -- tearing me -- apart. You don't understand. The Thirst -- Get out of here -- What are you talking about? We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours. How long have we been driving? I've been better -- For what it's worth, I'm sorry. You don't look so good. Any progress? Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card. We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story. Cancer. For your miracle cure? Just get out of here. I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream. You get used to the darkness. Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. Nothing that won't heal by dawn. You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown. Some kind of archive -- Like me. There are worse things than vampires out there. The way they move, they way they smell -- Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them. See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman. He will. Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver. You telling me you're ready to walk through that door? Look closer. What do you see here? There is no cure. It's war, now get the fuck out of the way! Preventive medicine. For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them. That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner -- This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now -- He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark? He didn't. Get over it. It worked, didn't it? Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up. Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint. Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that. I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business. Because you're tainted. The venom's still inside you. You could still turn on us. -- he's a vampire. You shouldn't be here. Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives. Whistler says I'm building up a resistance to it. I was in the neighborhood. How's it going, Kam? I don't believe that. You don't have to be. How could you be a part of this? Please -- Fight him -- But you -- died --I know. Just be quick about it, will you? Do it right. Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back. Going somewhere? What took you so long? Wait. Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy. I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- You should've killed her, then. Are we bringing home strays now? I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. How? Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this. Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I? I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live. Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by. Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in -- I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- Habit, mostly, just like this. Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience. The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control. The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst. We weren't sure we could trust you. Go on, I'll be fine! You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come. We keep in radio contact. There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative. Consider it a parting gift. Vampire mace -- silver nitrate, essence of garlic. Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock -- My name is Abraham Whistler. This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here -- You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --I'm afraid so. You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector. Have patience - you'll see for yourself. In there. Please, they'll kill me... You are mistaken. I don't know what you're talking about. Loose ends? Yes, of course. Everything's fine... He's seriously disturbed... Just visiting my patient. He tried to kill me! We are... living in their dreams... I'm... being... punished. Nothing. I don't know anything! No it isn't. You are doing it! Now raise it over the glass and... Don't ask stupid questions. Look at it. Please! Don't be foolish! Time is short. Let me show you something. Look at this syringe. Everyone get's one - very much like this... But this one's special. It will help you understand, everything... If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer. No, it's the truth. You can't go yet. We've got so much to talk about... What are you doing? I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though. Trust me completely. I'm here to help. Maybe. Anything but , my friend. We are little more than a sum of memories. From them we reference who we are, where we're going. Without a past we are nothing. This is why you are so interesting. You remember nothing, eh? Let me show you something. Not exactly. She was found in a canal, disembowelled. Throat cut. Blood drained. The body wrapped in a bed-sheet. I cannot say... You don't know the answer to that? Well... That's right. I am your doctor. If you like. Tell me about them... Bad dreams? Your name is John White. What does she say? The woman. Water? Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it? Is there nothing you remember? Not even a detail? You must try. You remember nothing? Who you are? What you've done?All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves. It's not going to help us! Why don't you want a message sent? Who are you? How do we get out of here? You the Captain? I don't know what these things are ...all I know is... Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish. I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish. Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch! Boat or no boat...I'm going... Who? Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be. Just trying to get to my boat... That's where my boat's moored. Did you clear this? I told you... Hanover, listen... Dead. I assume somebody up there has made sure no distress signal can be sent. Great woman your mother. Real foresight. Then you better start swimming. You're going to have to get a new one. We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly. Speedboat in the middle of the ocean... I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion. Who asked any? 20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime. I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup. The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule? Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes. Right here...middle of nowhere... You know what they say...the classics are eternal. Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason? He's not coming... This time, make an exception. You don't take orders very well, do you? Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go... I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready... Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine. Right... Jet ski...there's one left up there. There's not much horsepower left in the engines, but there's enough noise...once this baby's set...I'll rev it up...that slimy bastard will come for it like candy... Yeah... Not like him. You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this... It's not them...it's it... Keep tasting... You quit high school, lie about your age, join the navy, and next thing you know, four years are up and you need a way to make a living... Looking good... A meat locker. The quiet... I'm saying they're calling the shots... Like cattle... Takes one to know one. The "come back" kind. Boat or no boat... You woulda come back anyway. You're that kind of gal. Yeah you did... Got it? On the side!! With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right? Anti social? Quite a few. That's what I do. Well, you sure do a good imitation. You people...rich people... Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way... Nothing...you want to come, come... you don't... ...there's got to be a way to access out back there... I don't know... Jesus Christ lady... I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up? He's with them. Unless you collected on the insurance... I'm their ride. I'm not a thief. What other bunch? I saved your life is what I did! It ain't any better out there! ...we gotta get outta here -- NOW. Forget them... So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet? The hulls of these things are supposed to be impregnable... Let's just keep going. Joey... Joey... You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey? Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump... One whistle... Start the engine... How does an island sound to you? I have been. Line it up now, nice and easy... A little to the left... And you got 10 minutes before this thing livens up a boring evening. Seafood salad. You ever operate a jet ski? Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast? Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid? Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red... Joey... Which way's aft? I don't know...you got what we need? It's okay...come on... Joey...look at me... Joey...it's okay... Joey... I think he knows that Joey. Me?? Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit... Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed. ...Jagger was here...I was here... I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones... If I told you once...I told you a thousand times... I'm flying blind here God damn it!Maybe we lost them. You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do? Who gives a shit about aft? With who? Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job... Now, where's Mulligan? Where's Vivo? Shut up! Where are my men? I'd say that's a pretty good assumption. And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there. Not an option. We were talking about my schedule... I have a schedule... How soon can we get up and running? He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract. And no questions asked. This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract. Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone. Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses. Which question is that? And where is our point of arrival? No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box. You remember the first time we met Finnegan? I think you were just starting out...smuggling gold off Sumatra for those two Chinese...what did we use to call them? You want some too? Where are you going? You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you? I mean...where is everbody? Where is everybody?Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again... Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach... Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to... All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick? She's gone... Man, don't go up there... And what have you come up with? I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought. I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next... You know what I think? I think our luck has just about run shit out... I've never seen you so congenial with a mamber of the opposite sex... The two of you got a nice patter going...got a nice rapport... Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here? For juice, I gotta rebuild. That's not fast. Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid? Not even a Joey, I'm glad to see you? Joey, what happened to your leg? Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!! That way. If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe? Finnegan, what the hell was that? I'm stuck... What? You don't think I can have a normal life? ...Like a house in the suburbs... maybe a couple of kids...some sort of business...be in the bowling league...go to the ball games... You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life... Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need... No! The man in the moon!! Who's driving this thing? What did you do the my kids!! That's it? That's all you give a shit about? You don't give a shit about anything do you? Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud. I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care... Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried... Can we use our indoor voice please... What's there to think about?? That THING back there... Don't shoot, man, don't shoot! Why don't you help us so we can get done faster so we can get the hell out of here? John... Maybe it's the wrong ship.Feeling lucky? C'mon. AmeriTech's data-base. There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got? Shit. What do you know about locking cellular phone signals? We'll have to re-stock some basics. How fast can you learn? You wanna get caught spying on Albert? Who? Reynolds. How? What if what ? They've done it before. Takes maybe two minutes. If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays. Nah, they'd shut down the pin number. What if we transmitted it over cellular? I know. I know what they're looking for and I'm telling you. The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be looking for those moves. It'd never get through. All packages are screened, x-rayed and then hand-searched for explosives. You didn't like my "give-me-my- money" idea? I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits. Same thing? Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get near the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years. Goddammit-- Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Drive. Drive. These guys are incredibly persistent. Yeah, I can see where that'd-- Fuckin-A. We lost 'em. Think we let out enough air? Those are Feds. You sure? They shouldn't have come without calling first. Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way. In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building. Here? Them. They're here. Well, actually, you have proof. Could you walk a little faster please. The NSA killed him. Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah? Yeah. Take a walk with me. That is one ugly sunrise. Welcome to Santa's Workshop. What do you think? Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again. It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to Ramparts and split. That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach. Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan every phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis. They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do. Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic. Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted. I intercepted phone calls. I was a traffic analyst. None of your business. The NSA's been in bed with the entire tele-communications industry since the 40's. They've infected everything: Banks, computers, phones, mail, name it. The more technology we buy into, the easier it is keeping tabs on us. It's a brave new world. At least it better be. Oh, I'll bet that threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice! You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last-- I told you no calls. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? Jesus! I mean did you call anyone. Did you call anyone? The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here. I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'. I taped it off the 11 o'clock news. Move it. Get dressed. We're leaving. If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury. And take this. They froze your accounts. Get outa my way. And you won't. Now move-- Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even. Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed. No shit. Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it. They're spooks. Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow. If I knew, they'd be after me . Which they probably are right now. 'Bye. It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch. 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks. Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz. It's a SAT-tracker. I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away. You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339? Okay. Yes. That's who they are. You've heard of the National Security Agency? One of many people who would live a word with you. You knew the deal. No contact. My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you. Jerry's on vacation 'till Monday. I can give him the message when he gets back. That was Patrick and the last name-- Who's calling? Baudmore Consultants. Anytime. With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator... Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know... I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker. FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops. Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement. The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but-- Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say. Well, sir, I'm afraid it's not as simple as that. Your average newspaper guy or Hard Copy lady or whatever, they can't buy this stuff. A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.Who are you calling?! Someone else? Um...who's that? Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros. I just gave him my card. I'm telling you, I-- Nothing. Nothing. Yes. They said he was behind an extortion scheme. I don't know anything about Zavitz. Oh Jesus. It started with the information you gave me on DePinto. After we talked, he agreed to resign. Next, a phony detective asked me about Daniel Zavitz. Then an investigator questioned me about an extortion scheme they claimed Zavitz was behind. The FBI started looking into mob connections. A doctored picture in the paper. Overnight, I'm ruined. Wife. job, bank accounts, everything gone. Brill? I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape. Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good. It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator. Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol. Really? Told by whom? I don't know who he is. I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use. What kind of a question is that? Rachel Banks? Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family. Why? Not particularly, no. He came in four minutes ago. What are you dialing? I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that-- Pretty fast. We're gonna lead Albert by the nose to one conclusion. And then when he's pissed as hell, we're gonna drop the tape in his lap. How fast can you teach me what I need to know? No, I want the NSA to get caught spying on Albert. No. Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us. What if we just fucked with 'em? What if-- What if-- What if-- Listen-- Well how do I know what they're-- What if we hand deliver to their homes or office? What if we do a mailing to Congressmen. So what do we do now? What about newspapers and magazines? We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you-- No he won't. Tell him we're not gonna hurt him. We're not gonna hurt you. Tell me about it. Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay? That wasn't so hard. Oh my God... I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant? You're driving. Gimme that. What the fuck?! Why? 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please. Here ?! Where? Who? What's going on? Jesus. Do you have proof? Yeah. It really is. Did you find anything? Looks like Detroit. They come after you? Why'd you leave? Jesus. How'd you have the manpower to-- How'd you get around the tap orders? You used to work for 'em, didn't you? How do you know so much? I didn't use my name. Sorry. You told me no calls. I called from a payphone! I didn't use my name. I called my wife! Look, my wife is understandably-- What do you mean? One-twenty. We said a hundred. And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate-- You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it. How many years have you been hiding from them? How many years have you been running? What'd they do to you? I'll pay you. What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't. What if-- What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my life ?! I don't know anything . I don't know what that-- Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want? Wait. What do I do? Why are they after me ? I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. I don't know what that means. What is that? Yeah. Wait. You're crazy. The NSA? What do they have to do with this? Who are they? Who was that other guy? You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan. Dylan, I was just asking Eric if-- You got any money? Hello. Hello, Maria. Could you give me just a moment to talk to a friend of mine here? Not about this, but...Daniel? Listen, Daniel, hang on one second. Okay. Thanks. Eight. Size eight. Pardon? I'll say. I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a little about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish. Is that good? Can you help me? Yes. I have her permission. I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present... I'm married. Because my life is being ruined. Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible. That's my point. I know, but-- I don't know what's goin' on with Zavitz, but that was way, way outa line. You understand? Yes , for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these. To buy lingerie. No. Not that I could see. No, sir. No. I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work. Somebody took my blender. Than why don't you talk to the bus driver? Because I don't know. I'm not his attorney. I can't. What kind of trouble. I'm no expert, but I'm assuming that the impact of a moving bus against his body caused-- About what? I was in the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus. That's 'cause I wasn't there. A report? Oh...yeah, I didn't see the accident. The robbery. Hey, did you guys find my stuff? Thanks. Who are you? Yes? A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now. Yeah. I wish you could've met... Albert's gonna get me my job back. It's over. That's gonna end tonight. Yeah. Oh Christ. ...who root through...uh...presents, and... You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through-- That was for Christmas. You opened the thing? That's okay. Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech. Stacy-- Well...yeah. I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things electronically . The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway. Please. I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay. I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you. Has anyone been by? Police? FBI? Is Eric in school? Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit-- It wasn't me. I know. No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now. I know, but listen-- Stacy-- Stacy, don't hang up. Stacy-- It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up. It's not real... That's not me. I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks. I see her for business. I know. I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator. Yeah...look-- I've seen it. It's not true. Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm hearing of-- Stacy? There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it. Well, you know-- It's okay. No. Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric. A guy named Brill. Same guy as always. What do you mean? Yeah. A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids. The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me... ...he was upset about something and he said... Doesn't matter now. I'm gonna wash up. In front of Harrison's, he got hit by a bus. I knew him. The firm did some pro bono work for his organization a few years back. I saw a man die. Something bad happened tonight. I think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us. Right. Just for the criminals. Not a very good one, but-- Uh-oh. Hey. Don't count on it. My suitcase is gone. My suitcase-- Here, you can use this. It's a brand new card. Good news there, Mr. DePinto, you're talking to one. That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't-- You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun. That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada. It's not? I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very-- I don't believe it is, no. Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers. I'll see if I can, you know, work things out. My wife's Jewish. But that probably doesn't matter right now. No, I meant I'm Presbyterian. Actually, that's not true. I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me. Any idea what he looks like? Yeah. It's not me? I'm sorry about that. What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life? I did care how. Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me-- You have to. Tell me about Brill. I'm gonna fix it. Rachel-- That's temporary. My firm'll represent you. Free of charge. You being audited? I know. Will you hang on just a second. Who's doing this? You got a minute? All right, look-- Why? Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg. Thank you. How can I be sure. I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law. I like our history. And I like you. I'd probably like Brill if I ever got to-- Why would I-- Other than Brill. Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission. So you've said. Brill? "Soon". Or at least sooner than never. That wasn't the answer I was hoping for. Brill. When do I get to meet him? Not that much. I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same. It tastes like fish. Fuck you. You may have to-- Otherwise you may have to what? He didn't give me-- Fuck you. You may have to what? Otherwise you may have to what? He didn't give me-- If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't. You're wrong. He didn't. I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could-- Who are you people? Yeah? You're Brill. I don't know you, I don't know your name, I don't know what the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' sick of this! Get it?! Hey! My shoe? Jesus! What?! You want money?! Fuck off. Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name. You're firing me. Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know. This is bullshit . Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case. Brill. Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel. Oh, well, that's true. I don't under-- Listen-- Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments. Thank you, sir. I have to go lingerie shopping. God knows I would, sir, but I have a previous engagement this evening. My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you. Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth. The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now. That's because your Union bosses are those Guido mother-fuckers. L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans. Good point. Why? What are you talking-- Where's Stacy? No "900" numbers. It's okay to use the phone. I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here. Did you take anything --anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week. Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready? No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes. Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon. Do I know you? Where's mom? You staying for dinner? In your dreams. Sure, go ahead. Some of 'em. You're learning a cruel lesson. Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big. Go fuck yourself. Jerry? Yeah? No. No, it's okay. So do I! Go to 'em, Jerry. To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal. I won't make it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go. No, I-- You gotta-- Jerry-- I don't know! I don't know. I mean-- They're framing me. My stuff's all over her apartment. Yes. They killed Rachel. The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed-- It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this. Ssh! Jerry-- I'm a labor lawyer. There are always mob ties. Into what? An investigation? It was a bus accident. I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen? Table 122? Serve the ball. What? No, but they took my blender. I love my blender. They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender. Why don't you give 'em a call. No. No. They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo. Yeah, what's going on? Are you okay? Tell me about it. I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little-- It's been a few years. It's me, Robert Dean. From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on-- Jesus! I just told you. I don't know. I don't know. I honestly don't know. He got hit by a bus. You remember Daniel Zavitz? The police? Why not? You would? Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.Alright! How long can you stay? Yeah. Who won the fight? Are you and mom getting a divorce? Where've you been? Dad! She's in the kitchen. He's kidding. Dad! Really? Can I open 'em up? Are those my Christmas presents? Hi, dad.Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve. Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units. Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary. We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now. Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body. We don't know. If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources. If they've looked at the video. And they have the video. That's confirmed. No sir. Yes sir. Well...his real name's Edward Lyle. We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill. I just meant-- Sir-- He's clever. He had help. He had help. It was in his bag. Now it's not. He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying. We'd have to-- Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney. Mr. Reynolds? Sir? He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact. There was a transfer. We found the originals. He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.Yeah? Turn yourself in. Bobby? Piece of advice? I'm sorry, man. I have a family. Bobby, you're in way over your head. To the cops? You gotta let me bring you in to the police. No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in. Listen to me. You're tired. Why would the NSA-- Why would they-- Bobby-- Jesus. Rachel's dead? Calm down. Bobby-- Bobby-- Christ! Just be cool. Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties. He's heard that it's escalated. The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation. That's what I want to talk to you about? Can I talk to you a second? They only took electrical appliances. Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric? They didn't take the silverware? The blender? What about jewelry? Usually they take clothes. You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em? Did they take your clothes?Get it. Then what's your goddam opinion? I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right? What's your opinion? There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!? Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum? What? It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and-- It means who's side are you on? "I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II. He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place. Kill him now. What's your ETA? Do you have visual? And if it wasn't? What about the tape? Explain that. What about-- Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god dammit , Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now! Oh, let's assume that they have. So they know everything. Dean's with Lyle. You're kidding me. Lyle?! We believe? I don't care if he's Solomon with Saint Joseph sitting in his lap . I want the tape and I want him. Now is-- No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland. He's clever? He had help? Oh. I sit on top of the greatest intelligence gathering organization in human history. Why can't I bring in a man whose name <i>is in the</i> <i> fucking</i> <i> phonebook</i> ?! Help from whom? Christ. 30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there? Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks. Hiding something? Get it. Contact COINTEL. Profile. Assess the threat. Then cross-check against Zavitz. Red-flag the intersects and anything we can exploit. Also NRO. Pull up the keyhole tapes. I need to own him. I need to own him now . Who? Am I to understand-- The originals? What about the tapes? What happened? Now is that clear? Then let's assume I don't. Do I look like I want a tiny pizza? No thank you. Yes?Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games. So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me? I like my life. I'm a free man. I'm not a kid. You mean us? If you enjoy it, you should do it. You liked it too. I didn't mean to... Hey, no strings, right? That's what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other. He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex. It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo. This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who's done things with his life. I wasn't going to try anything. What's that mean? If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like my famous person. Yeah, my own personal famous person. Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to. I've gotten to know someone who's famous. You know what? I think you guys are all jealous. So what did you think? Maybe it's supposed to be funny. Go wash glasses if you don't like it. We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that! We are watching my fucking movie. Fuck you. Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. What makes you say that? Why is everybody giving me crap tonight? Thanks, doll. But how're you going to explain this? How did you get him out of the pool? We have his note. But I didn't do this! He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself. I didn't do it. This wasn't me. I put him to bed. He's not there? Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood. Thanks. Why do you do it? Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go? I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale. It's not what you think. I'm not going to hurt anyone. No! Well...no, not really -- You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo. A homo? Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those. You're sure of that? Then you're as single as I am. Yeah? What's your husband do? You ever been married, Hanna? You proposing what I think you're proposing? Don't you think I'm a little young for you? Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me? I'm not married. You mean family? All in Joplin, Missouri. I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go? Movie stars? How long you worked for Mr. Whale? That's okay, Hanna. I'm more comfortable in here. It is Hanna, isn't it? Tea is fine. Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then. Something I can do for you? You do that. Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him? Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not? What're you talking about? It's your job, lady, not mine. I'm here so he can draw my picture. Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because -- You'll feel better tomorrow. All right. Need some help? Did I hurt you? You okay? Look, if you want to die do it yourself! You're crazy. I haven't done a damn thing with you! I'm not that way. Get it through your fucking head. I don't want to mess with you. Just take off the fucking mask! It's too tight. All right. Let's take it off now. It's from the first World War, isn't it? I don't know. Why? What did you expect? Bronze? What won't do? What'd you say? You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up. Your friend? You're planning a trip? But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you. I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here." I was wondering which here you meant. James Whale. This afternoon at the party. That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here." Storm's getting worse. Do you mind? Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup. You know what he did when I called him? He laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes. I didn't have the guts for it. I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself. The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance. They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family. That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family. By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out. My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen. -- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest. I never made it to Korea. Never gave it much thought. Why not? Give us something to do while we wait. I thought you'd given up on my picture. Is that --? Do I have any other choice? You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms? No. Definitely not. Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling? Good. Let's get dry. Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter. I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia. You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon. Can't you see? It's raining! Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it? Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again. Actually, no. I feel a little out of place. Is that really her? No. The girl. Who's that? What was that about? I don't hear anything. If that's okay? Do I look okay? Clayton is fine. I'm game. Sure. You don't want me to sit for you anymore? No harm done. I don't get it. First you creep me out with homo shit. Then you hit me with war stories. And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want? You asked me to model. Remember? You're the one who started it. I didn't -- Something happened to him? This was World War I? You were a soldier? You're talking through your hat now. You must think the whole world is queer. Well it's not. War sure isn't. There's no people like you in my crowd. Not fear. More like disgust. I told you. I don't like to talk about that. Not me. I don't know. I guess I like your stories. I'd like to sit for you again. But only if you ease up on the locker room talk. Okay? You first. From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand? Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? Do you have to rub my nose in it? Cut it out! How long were you...? You've done a helluva lot more than most people. Do you miss it? What happened? Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free? Thoreau with a lawnmower. The world is just one kiss-ass game after another. A man has to make up his own life, alone. You know how it is. You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it. Not at the moment. I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel. I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on. I just feel more comfortable keeping it on. You just said you didn't want me self-conscious. Sorry. Not today. Can I see what you did so far? No. I -- What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say. You know. Look at me like -- like I look at women. You don't think of me that way, do you? I'm not, you know. No, I -- you're a homosexual. So you had a wife? You ever been married, Mr. Whale? Sorry. I don't feel like sitting still today. Can't today. Full up. I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega. No. I could have, though. Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone. I don't like to talk about that. Why? Was it supposed to be funny? No. I liked it. We all did. Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends. This David's a friend? Go ahead. All right, I guess. I don't mind. I'm not crazy about my old man either. I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks. We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either. What? Your family ate dripping? Sounds like something you feed the dog. No. I'm fine. Take a picture, it lasts longer. All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway. But it's just my face you want to draw. I'm not wearing an undershirt. It's new. "Bride of Frankenstein." Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night. All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough. You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right? And it's just my head you want? Nothing else? But why? You mean -- you really want to draw me? Just a year. I dropped out to join the Marines. Football in college. Broke is more like it. What's to sketch? You mean, like posed for pictures? Huh? What was wrong? What did she mean by going flooey? Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those. "Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest? Really? Yeah? What were some of your movies? Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something? They're just copies then. Gotcha. I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar. Excuse me, but -- are you famous? These are your paintings? No. Iced tea's fine. I stink to high heaven right now. Just got away from me. Sorry to disturb you. Yeah. I better get on with my work. Just that I was in the Marines. Boone. Clayton Boone. Nice place. Mornin'. Have a drink? I think I'll hang around. This kisser wasn't so bad you couldn't lay under it a few times. I liked it. You learn stuff listening to old-timers. I'm up. Thanks. Fuck off! Where's Betty? I thought I'd give you a hand since I kept you open. The Monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. What sick about that? I just want to watch it, okay? Good. Fine. If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie. See if his name's on it. How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast. Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own? I didn't ask George to invite you. Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that? You know what I mean. Your reputation. You only embarrass yourself. You didn't, Jimmy. Should you be drinking in your condition? I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception. What are you doing here? Goodbye, Hanna. By the way, I like the Renoir. You remember how a production eats up one's life. I'm sorry, Jimmy. But with this movie and two difficult stars -- Then take the pills. She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.Don't go away. Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters. I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary. I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list. Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party. Right. I was going to take a swim. Oh my God. What's wrong, Mr. Whale? Is it your heart? Mr. Whale? Are you all right? He's one of the great images of the twentieth century. As important as the Mona Lisa. Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look? Okay. "Frankenstein." Tell me everything. Just like going swimming, isn't it? I can't believe I'm doing this. Can that count as one question? Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"? Can we talk about the horror movies now? I guess. George Cukor? Who made "A Star Is Born"? I never guessed. Too warm for a sweater, anyway. That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal. Then the rumors are true? You're serious. That's funny, Mr. Whale. I don't mind. No. I never said you were. Or will be soon. But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for. Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all -- How much longer before we get to "Frankenstein"? Your father was a schoolmaster? Everything. Start at the beginning. Nice. And your lighting and camera angles. You're got to go back to German silent movies to find anything like it. Sure. That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "Bride of Frankenstein." I know. People's movies aren't their lives. And this is your house. Wow. The house of Frankenstein. I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa. Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors. I can't believe I'm meeting you.Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow... When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle -- I can undress myself, thank you. Pray you, undo this button. Nothing I didn't deserve. Oh Clayton. No, I don't want to die alone. But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable. They say you never see the one with your name on it. But I want to see death coming at me. I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. Your face. Think, Clayton. You'd be my second Monster. Almost as famous as the first. It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share. Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. Please, Clayton. We've come this far. Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself? Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms. Won't they be surprised? Oh, but you feel good, Clayton. Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you. I can't hear a word. What was that? There are straps in back. Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect. For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking. Don't move. You are much too human. No. It won't do. So it is going to happen after all. Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love. All gone to me now. Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? Barnett. Barnett on the wire. Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make. I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps. I don't remember that one. "A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters." Not at all. That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one. A very good story indeed. I'm very sorry. What happened? Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake? A very lucky thing indeed. The Great War? I see. But you said -- Come now. I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? Someone for whom death would be a blessing. Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing? I'd like to try again. If you're game. After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches? The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster. Very sporting of you, Clayton. Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know. That only leaves the rest. You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants. I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes. Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already? Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man? It's not like her. Catch my death. We're not sugar. We won't melt. Let's get out of this funk hole Run for what? Monsters? The only monsters... ...are here. Neither of us really belongs here. Are you enjoying yourself? David produced her last picture. Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor. David. The friend I thought was in New York. Nothing of importance. Just two old men slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink? Exactly. Cukor was too cheap to hire music. There's nothing but chin-wag. The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag. What did I tell you? Listen. Nothing would please me more. I suppose you'd like the top down. Good afternoon, Clayton. Very good, Clayton. May I call you Clayton? Or do you prefer Boone? If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest. There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused. It was foolishness to attempt this portrait. You cannot force what will not flow. My apologies. I had no business snapping at you. I want -- I want... Just go. Please. Why don't you go? Of course I remember. Do you think I'm so senile -- You're very clever, Mr. Boone. You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking. What a crazy old poof. Why are you here? What do you want from me? Why do I tell you this? I never told David. I never even remembered it until you got me going. You will not set me on another walk down memory lane. Not this lane. Not today. Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett. He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me. Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved me. But chastely, like a schoolboy. No, my dear. The Crimean War. What do you think? The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had -- I was an officer. Not at all. I was in the foxholes myself. Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers. No teammates in football? No comrades in Korea? Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion? And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that? What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes. Everybody has stories to tell. I'm curious, Mr. Boone. What convinced you to come back? Mr. Boone. You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday. Oh no. I never swim. The extras are in their places. Now we need the star. Wouldn't you like to get in the pool? I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no -- Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks -- Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show. But I chose freedom. David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." The dirty little secret of a nervous producer. Better work. I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work. It's so far in the past now. Over fifteen years -- After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business? The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I was blamed. You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The horror movies were behind me. I'd done "Show Boat." Major success. Great box office. Now I was to do something important. "The Road Back." An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was to be my masterpiece. In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures. I like that. But take care, Mr. Boone. Freedom is a drug, much like any other. Too much can be a very bad thing. Ah. A philosopher. Very well put. Why not? Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone. You have a steady companion? Of course. I don't want to scare you off. Not before I'm finished with you. Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two little buttons. Oh dear. I have made you nervous. But we have to match the other sketch. It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt. I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today? So we understand each other? Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type. What way might that be? I never thought you were. Oh dear. If one must have a clinical name. Does that surprise you? Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years. No. At least not in the legal sense. Just a trim. And mine while you're at it. Fingers are a bit stiff today. All righty. I understand. I'll pay our going rate. Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges. What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me? Yes, I believe you could. How free is your schedule this afternoon? Quite true. Hand-to-hand combat is the true test. Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand? It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of. Did you kill anyone? Of course. I had to make it interesting for myself, you see. A comedy about death. The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke. But the Monster never receives any of my gibes. He is noble. Noble and misunderstood. Pity. People are so earnest nowadays. Did anyone laugh? Did you now? Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment. Lunch should be ready. Shall we? Is this David's doing? Do you mind? I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor. How are you, Mr. Boone? So glad you are free for lunch. You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia. In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them. No, you were middle class, like all Americans. There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone? I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me. I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is. Of course not. As I said, only poor people -- It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar. Dripping? Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread. It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks. That's exactly what I intend to do. We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness? Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable... Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly. I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? That shirt, Mr. Boone. Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man." Shall we begin? You don't say? Which picture? Excellent. We'll have a most interesting time. I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that. What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It's a great deal to ask of someone. Yes. You were a Marine. You went to university? But expressively broken. How did it happen? You have the most architectural skull. And your nose. Very expressive. Sat for an artist. Been sketched. To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled? You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone. But you have a marvelous head. Nothing serious. A touch of stroke. I returned recently from a stay in hospital. When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you. Please, Mr. Boone. Help yourself. Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door? I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks. This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures. In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here. But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures? They were familiar when I painted them. That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that's a Rembrandt. You know what they say. If you have to ask -- What? Oh yes. Splendid. Or would you prefer a beer? The honest sweat of one's brow. I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two. I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea. I'd like it very much if you'd join me. Everything alright, Mr. Boone? Getting to be a warm day. A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. The Marines. Good for you. You must have served in Korea. I couldn't help but notice your tattoo. That phrase? Death Before Dishonor. What does it mean? And your name is --? My name is Whale. This is my house. Good morning. Yes. Perfectly. Then who did? No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent. But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air. Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again? I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume. You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton. Oh, David, stop being a nanny. Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York. Thank you. Oh, David. There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty. You better go, my boy. You'll be late for that aeroplane. "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars." I wanted to be alert for your visit today. Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital. It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe. If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better. That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life. So what do I do? But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity? You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head? Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there? Good-bye. So nice to see you... Oh dear. Of course. Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit -- But you appear quite fresh, my dear. Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old. Elsa? Nonsense, my dear. You look extraordinary. Today's script. Quick. And a pencil. Bring a mirror. Let the Bride feast upon her visage. I'll be out this afternoon, remember? Your family can visit as long as they like. It needs a hat. There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora... Of course. How is the old boy these days? Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna? I'd hardly call our yardman a friend. Who was that at the door? Does the yardman come today? I'll be fine, Hanna. Thank you. She is beautiful. No, Hanna. My heart isn't that black. Don't be silly, Hanna. He's a very proper actor. And the dullest fellow imaginable. Go. Just go. We can manage without you. Yes, yes, yes. I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard. My mind's lovely. And yours? No. Let me lie here. Thank you. Oh shut up. All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him. You must think I'm terrible, Hanna. Luminal. Yes? Don't be daft. It's just a student from the university. There is iced tea, Hanna? Cucumber sandwiches? Hanna? Who's the new yardman? My monsters? I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs. You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor? You didn't? Mr....Kay? I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home. Head. Not heart. I just need to -- lie down. Studio. Daybed in studio. You think so? That's very kind -- My idea. Muchly. My sketches. Big heavy brow. Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef. Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly. I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one. Righto. Let me see. Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste. Of course. Certainly, Mr. Kay. Is there anything in particular you want to know? Don't be shy. There's time to stop before you go too far. Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story. You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago. Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica? A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks. What rumors might those be? Quite. It is, isn't it? My life as a game of strip poker. Shall we play? Let's make it more interesting. I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing. I have a proposal, Mr. Kay. This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think? I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay. Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses. Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures? There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End". Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job. "Journey's End" made the careers of everyone associated with it. It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned. Of course. I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one. Yes? I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow. Grandfather was a bishop. Church of...Church of Eng... So, Mr. Kay? What do you want to know? This is the studio where I paint. After you then. Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay? Is it now? Hanna? I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool. One likes to live simply. No. I expect you can't. Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale. Sit? Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see... You want to take a walk with me? Was the trip okay? Tubab means white man. No. I am a "tubab." Yes? And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more. But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore... And I don't want you to come home until you do know... ... one way or the other. I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me. Take your time. May I have a suggestion? Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back? How are you feeling about work? You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking... I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare. I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured... Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn. Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you. Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon. Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried. I wish I did. Huh-huh. You? Oh well... branding will do that to you. I thought you guys were going to call me. Good night. I miss you, Annie. Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit. When are you coming home? So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all? Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it. And you think it's best if I don't come. What if she doesn't want to go? I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary. I'm not pretending anything! Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time. Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability... No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea What... Bo-... What about the magazine? You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the -- I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave... You've already made arrangements!? NO! What are you -- you're serious about this? That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not. I don't understand. You just said he said no. What was I saying? What did he say? Did you get a hold of that horse guy? They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there. All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with. Doing what? I love you. I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs. How's my pregnant chick! "... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'... ... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria? It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... ... Whether or not we were... ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch. Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over... The funeral's on Friday. I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... I wanted to say something... But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter. No, let me go. Nothing new. He's just going off duty. I'm sorry. No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it. She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging... Okay. We'll see you later then. That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner? Riding with Judith. Okay. You want me to pick you up? So, what, uh, what train are you taking? Hi. Shouldn't we have invited Tom over? I know. Amazing. What, sweetheart? Honey, you all right? Did something fall? You want to watch some television? Do you want something else, honey? We order something else? OK, OK. No, not yet. I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger. I understand... How much longer do you think? I can't believe it's the same horse. Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.The point was to love each other. I don't know any other way, Annie. I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set. Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us... Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long. Annie! Ssshhh... Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that? I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody. Now, listen. I want you to stand on him. Tom. Huh? Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta. Just make yourself comfortable. Everything under control? Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here. I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em... Ever think of moving there full time? Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place. She was never really happy here. She did the best she could. College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was... Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom. Five years. My son was born here. You look all right. You want to pick it up a little? Feel good? Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse. Good... You have a nice seat. OK. I'll stop talking then. Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket. No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra. He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you. You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out... Need a lift? Enjoy the day. Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home. Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger. It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you. I thought you were an editor, not a reporter? Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together. You sleeping all right in that house? Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers. A jogger, huh? Just who's been laughing at who here? I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time. You seem surprised? When I was first married. Does Chicago count? What's that to miss? Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little. Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation? You ever just stand still for a minute? So how was your first and last day of branding? You okay? You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome. That's up to Pilgrim. I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie. Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine. You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go -- -- if you'll help. You have a problem with that? When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too. Doesn't matter. Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now. I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to -- All by yourself? You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that? Were you thinking of personally driving me back East? Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through! I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now. I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them. Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City? Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of... Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing. Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems. Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called. No thanks. Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny. I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once. I don't believe they'll expect that. He thought it was a ghost. I don't think Warren would go for that. Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding... They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother. We should be fine, then. Yeah. I don't believe it. Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time. He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him. Grace, I need you to come with me. It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done. There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay? Sure? There's no hurry. Take you time. I know you do. Don't you disappear. You do whatever you have to, to hold on... I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think. I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen... I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere... Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim? That must have been pretty special. Where did you get Pilgrim from? Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself. Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road. Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas. Put the key in and turn it. The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake. I don't have all day. It's never too soon to start. Can you drive? You're catching on. Not to me. Either you want to or you don't. Mmm. An editor. What does she do? She gonna be long? Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around? Is the poverty worse, now, you think? Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim. We still have a way to go. Oh yeah... You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together. Sometimes. You ever miss it? How long were you married? I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up. Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck. If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might. You're looking fit. Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late. Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up. Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts. What stuff is that? Well, that'll happen.Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son. We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right. Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend. I guess so. Estes came after me with a gaffing hook. Come on. We're gonna be okay. Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming. What? What are you talking about? Where? Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. I'm going to take a walk and dry off. I scared you -- I crossed the line -- It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think... What do you mean, Julie? Julie? What's wrong? You can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand. You sure it's okay with you? And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. Right. Planes get hit by lightning. They get hit by meteors. They hit other planes. Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all. What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute... Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second. I said, this...Do you want a drink? This was not my idea. Are you sure? Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school... Are you okay? To get out of Southport? It's...the anniversary. That's what's going on...Take it easy on yourself. It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better. I'm sorry. The shower again? You don't seem fine. You sure? Julie! Wait! You okay? He's probably the only one who can help us. Alone. In the room. Got any advise? Ahh, that feels great. Come on, it'll be fun. Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... I'll go find him. Where'd Estes go? We'll only be a second, okay? The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? And do what with it? You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. You don't have to be a jerk. How's the water? So why are you still here? We didn't get all dressed up for nothing. See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it. Some folks just can't sail.And Tom took care of them. The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us. Well what? He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone. That inspires confidence, that does. I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights. Bacon, see what we got. I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there. Yes? They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can they? I'll think of something, don't worry. Because it's cheap like a budgie. I still will, if you don't mind. Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist. The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big boy now and it is time to move on. Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . . Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do? Invitations? I mean it's fucking empty. There's nothing in it! Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge. I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear. Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him. It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am going to call him. There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won. That's it all done, we are off. If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate. Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea. Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom? No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume he will still And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them. Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and... Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit! Hit the fuckers. Are you sure you can afford twenty-five? The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside? Tom? Tom, don't mess around, let's go. This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go. Tom, this is our case. You and me, Tom. He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now. Where the hell are we supposed to hide? Everything all right out there, Tom? Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look. Why, what's up? He means they're thieving dogs. The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him. Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry. I wanted to talk to you about that. It's Ed, if that's what you mean. Unless you are going to accept twenty quid. I'll see ya. That's if I want to see you. I need two hundred and fifty grand. I think I would rather just turn them over. You will what? That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred. Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father. A hundred grand.Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good. It's hit us all hard! I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas? When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons. What do you mean? I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid. Well, what's going on? You what? What are you on about? I hope this is the right move. You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours? And look what happened to that. No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward. Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a robbery. Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know. Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . . What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what? Well, what do you want us to do about it? Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat man and Bacon? OK, don't panic; let's think about this. The money, the gear! How the fuck should I know? Er, well, twelve. Twelve. Six. Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get. I would take a pain in the arse for half a million. What about all the gear? What's left over?' When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know. Where did you get those from, a museum? Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets! Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups? Tom, you're all heart. You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be funny, but you're not. That's going on optimism. Get your fingers out of my soup! Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him. I wanted to talk to you about that. A what? Is there something we should know about you, Soap? Seven hundred for the pair. Well, it's still a good idea. Probably no longer than four weeks. I'll kill him! Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal. We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them to you, could they? I'll only be a minute. I'11 meet you in the car. . . . What? What do you mean, me? Well, what did he say? Right as rain. I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em. Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy! What the hell are you doing here? What do you mean? You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters. Who's this fat man, then? All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man? Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean. They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets? Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from? I think you're Nick the Greek. Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns. Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's on and burning bright for the masses. Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit. You know it doesn't include the amp. You know how much it is, Nick. What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal. That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses. How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy? That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got? How many feet? How many wings have they got between them? There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? You would take a pain �n the arse full stop. This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse? Hold on, give us half a chance to count it. Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it? Nick the Greek. It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid! Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests. What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in. Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course. So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences. If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money? What have you come as?Shut up, knave! Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison. I grow closer to my target, your Majesty. Your Majesty... If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel. I will kill both him and the man who told me. How can I serve you in this? Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty. Your birthday celebration, your Majesty? Then to the Bastille. Perhaps he serves a different king. Perhaps. But of d'Artagnan I am certain. What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King. He seeks redemption. Bloody hell... Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart. It presses us but it is good for us too! Louis' whims make him more vulnerable. We are less ready, but so are his guards! Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that. If we miss him now we may not get another chance. You said you'd do anything, Athos, anything to replace this King. So do it. I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King. He can learn to be Phillippe in time. But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days. Paris. There is still much to do. We'll be back soon. Be ready. The mask is terrifying... especially when unexpected. Do you notice? Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity. He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months. About to hang himself, I should think. Now. You were saying? Going into the barn naked -- or so it appears. Go on. You grow fond of him. That's good. The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball. It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one. At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then? Remember France. Remember the poor. Remember Raoul. More wine!! Where are those serving girls...? Three days. You can do it. More wine!! How is he? Yes, and he has a choice! Do you think I have not considered that? I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant! Those can be adopted -- I have it all worked out. There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else. Those are the words of a broken spirit. My spirit is whole. I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy. You are bitter, Athos. You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy. You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth. Tomorrow. Excellent, Athos. You have a keen sense of this man. A body. Come, we have a boat waiting. Soon enough. Here we are. Making the key to the throne. It can. I know the way. Replace the king. Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him. As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both. He has already picked the Pope. Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way. D'Artagnan... Those are young Musketeers down there. They have been weaned on our legends. They revere us -- it is an advantage. Why don't we charge them? They will know you helped us, if we go this way. Phillippe, get into the boat. Into the boat! Now! Pull them back! Pull them back, d'Artagnan. I know. God go with you. I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan. But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone. I will need you all. All for one. One for all. Look at us. We are old men now. But once we were young. And when we saw injustice, we fought it. Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem. A simple theological discussion. D'Artagnan. Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway. Bread and wine... in that cupboard. We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up. The Queen Mother. Anne. But what if something extraordinary happened? Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else? Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned. Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong. So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her. Come on... We go someplace dangerous. Coming? You've been moping for months. Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me. Now get some rest. Because the old king had a twin as well, and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne. Then he had two heirs, not just sons but twins. So he decided that one be put away, as if he never existed. You, Phillippe. I carried the king's child! The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret! No, not Louis! Not just a baby, Porthos. I carried the child of the king. But I was on duty... The greatest secret of life is who we truly are. Now I must give you that secret, which has been kept from you your whole life. It began on the night when Louis was born. I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor. And why are you so glum? Easy to say, but hard to do. For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France. So they tell us. But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression? When no conscience is tolerated? No dissent, no objection? Catacombs. Very holy. It is also a place of burial. Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane. If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river? Hell may be our destination, dear Porthos, but not this trip. Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?! Forgiveness. There are more important things than tits. Be quiet, you fat fool. Can't you see I'm praying?To the Bastille. And death. So what has changed? You're a fool! We can't... stay here. That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place. Hold your goblet with two fingers. But -- Aramis, this will never -- But -- What you're asking is impossible! But Aramis -- ! Phillippe can learn in time, but -- Where are you going?! All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal. Poor Phillippe! But -- but -- We must stop him! Hang himself?! But -- what is he doing? But -- what is Porthos doing? Don't play God with me, Aramis I -- Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil -- Three days??!! In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to -- You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he -- Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis -- It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours! It is Phillippe's as well! And people close to him, who -- Physical resemblance is but one small thing! Louis has an arrogance, a manner -- Switch?! That is your plan? It is ludicrous! Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son. What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others? Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?! He who is not with us is against us. You are not my priest, Aramis! You would not be, even if I had one. Tonight! Right now! We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?! Who is he, Aramis? His plight is obvious, isn't it? Prison was horrible but it was his home. He's been torn from it by strangers. He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar. Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow. I see that is a body! But where did you get it? What is that? The Prison of Belle Sur. Porthos sleeps, and you plot. Don't you think it's time you told me what it is you are plotting? What are they doing? I am with you! What do you propose to do? And some problems cannot be settled without one. It's a prison, you idiot! They don't expect anyone to try getting in! The problem will come when we want out! You are right. But it is a trap. He lures us to capture. At a ball, everyone watches the King! What do we do now? Who does? Raoul -- Raoul, no... You cannot do this. No matter how your heart is broken -- Fromberge...?! At the front?! No. Die? What...? Piglet -- ? What are you -- ? Michelle cannot possibly accept! But -- are you sure? That must be Raoul! Raoul! Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong? You look awful! She died giving you to me. And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves. Perhaps this will help. None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you. He lies. He is here to trap us. If you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor, or anything else -- then stand now, and let it happen. Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty? He is a monster! He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame! He has no honor! It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor! The King killed my son! To kill the king. Get out of my way. Save my son, d'Artagnan. You trust his character more than anyone else does. Oh my friend. Raoul is everything to me. What hope is there? A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that? Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul -- You knew this was happening. You knew and that's why you came. She's a woman, d'Artagnan! From a poor family. You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much. Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love! This cannot be. Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king! I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today! I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity. Now he has complete happiness, and I mope. Another? How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three? Four? Midnight! Mon dieu! Driving the youngsters hard, eh? You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months? Life is too long. Except when we have our friends. Look at you! You're still a boy! Sit, sit! I'll open a bottle of wine. D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan... One for all. All for one. Phillippe...? She will be at the ball. Your mother's. These rooms are yours. Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle. How did you know -- ? No! Do not be sorry! Never be sorry! The King cares for nothing and for no one! There are no mistakes when you are King! What you do is right for every person! A King has contempt for everyone! I will sit with you. I can't sleep either. I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with. It is something I have done -- or did not do. I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it. The desire for vengeance... can be a poison. Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand. Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it. Recent hours have been a shock. Phillippe. Rest now. And you never knew why? Who came? Are you hungry?Anne... The night we had together... I always wanted more. But that one, it was enough. Enough to make me love you forever. I want you to remember that... and go on. As strong as you are now. No matter what happens. There were two. Not one. But two. I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight. My Queen... Anne...! I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart. I can't bear to see you cry. What is wrong? M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death... What -- ? M'lady...? No, M'lady. God smiled upon us. M'lady...? I trained those men myself. They will stand and fight. But if we are to die, let it be this way. That doesn't matter now. Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river. Everyone back. You can't do it. I cannot betray Louis. I will defend him with my life. The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God. You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king! I have sworn to him! No! Stop -- We have grown wiser with age. Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword. Aramis -- the King wishes to see you. I came to see you safely out. Check for yourself. I cannot, Athos. Dearly as I love you, I cannot. No man is all bad... or all good. I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn. And perhaps I can help him. An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed! The cannons killed Raoul! The cannons, and love. But not the King. Athos! I know life means nothing to you at this moment, but I will not let you kill yourself. Where are you going? Athos, I beg you -- Athos, please...! Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too. I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused. I know. I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting. I fear I know our King. I came to try to bring you hope. If the young woman truly loves Raoul -- I heard your playing. They must stay sharp. There was an attempt on the King's life today. I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it. Thanks, but not for me. It's been too long. Athos, my friend! There. Aramis, Porthos and Athos too. I know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed, with no harm coming to your Majesty. If their passions were in error, their spirits have ever been noble. Forgive them. Not once have I ever asked anything for myself. I ask now. Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother. Your Majesty... This man before you... He is royal blood, the same as you. To spill it is the one thing even you cannot do. It is against the laws of God, and of France. I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled -- ... You knew you had a double? Yes, your Majesty. It shall be done, your Majesty. Your Majesty...? Your Majesty. This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking -- I just left the garden, it was empty. What did you see? Thank you, your Majesty. Order Fromberge to keep him in safety! It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor! At least help Raoul. Not criticize -- plead. Love. Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry. Love women, and they will love you. Love yourself, and -- There is more to love than he knew, or that you know. It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me. It is yours. I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle. But do they love you? Do you love them? What about a queen to love? A son of your own? Your Majesty has had many women -- In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers. She had written him many letters of love. Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort. She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations. Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature. It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor. But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous -- Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that -- The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me. Your Majesty... Phillippe! No. Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son. I must insist, Sire. Sire, we have an emergency -- of security. I must ask you to accompany me.Wear it until you love it. And die in it!! D'Artagnan, you will hunt down Aramis, Porthos and Athos, and bring me their heads, or I will have yours. And as for you, Phillippe... Back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate. He is nothing now. What had you to do with this, Mother? My guards are useless! Take her from me! It -- it doesn't matter, Mother! He is dead now! Dead! You have prayed too much. Your mind is weak. Why would you ask now? You never asked before! I am King, Mother! And I do not wish to discuss this with you. He is dead! By God's choice! There is nothing to discuss. What is it, mother? I am preparing for a ball! Mother -- ? D'Artagnan, arrest them all! Phillippe?! Why do you call me -- Wh-- Wha-- You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General, and you will have a palace of your own. How goes that favor I asked of you? Once a Musketeer, always a Musketeer, eh? Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private? I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves! Can you imagine the arrogance? Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order! No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold. Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France! He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself. Next week. This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief. I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits. Where is Michelle? They have plotted against me! Me! The embodiment of God's will! Forgive?! Get out of my way. My twin. Which has kept him alive. Until now. He is my brother. I was told this impostor was dead! Even the bedchamber passages! Let none remain! I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one! ... tired. Must... lie down. You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan. It... was nothing. A nightmare, nothing more. Go away, I -- I will consider it. Now leave me. Silence! I order you! That is enough! You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place! You dare criticize my father?! Or lecture me?! What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me. That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner! Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation. By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here. Betrothed? I think not. A personal nature? I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering. Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food. I will deal with it tomorrow. Aaa! D'Artagnan! These passages were constructed for the King's security, not so you could step from my father's portrait and startle me to death! Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers. Let us behave as if my wish is law. And my wish is to enjoy this party! I am King, d'Artagnan. I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish! I decided it this morning. What is it, d'Artagnan? Assassins falling from the sky now? Shoot them! Shoot them! Cowards! Twenty run from four?! When he returns, watch him. When he leaves again, you tell me. Now. Where is d'Artagnan? Not by you. I will order d'Artagnan to do it. You may go, Lieutenant. Who was Athos seeking? Tell me! Did he try to enter the palace? Did they kill him? Yes, yes, go on. Exactly why it should be given away. Ah yes, the riots. We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no? Aramis! I have been expecting you! We are satisfied, that will do. Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it? Riots? My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth. Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment? Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend. And now he is dead and that is very sad but -- I will order a Mass for his soul. It will guarantee his place in Heaven. I did not want to upset you. It was tragic. I did everything I could for him. I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting. But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger. No, you may wait behind the screen. If you don't want to be so appealing, why did you touch the rose to your skin? Where was it? Here? You are beautiful. You know you are. My dear, I've already done it. Wait, no! Do not be ashamed. The straits of your family need not be permanent. It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them. This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead. You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption. Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things. The food doesn't please you? Enough of this, our dinner waits. From Raoul. He urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger... from your king. A letter. May I see? How did I get in? You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that? You blush! You do not wish to be beautiful to your King? I would have said it was impossible, but I believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful.The old man and woman called me... Phillippe. A man in black. I never saw his face. He took me to the cell. A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask. For days I shouted, "What have I done? Why do you do this to me?" But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting. This place... I once lived in a country house. I had guardians -- an old man and woman. And tutors. But no friends. Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison. Just... water. What was the end page? Two-thirty-seven: "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..." What number, on the first page? What number did you tear out? Thank you, Keeper. No, Keeper.He is right, d'Artagnan. Can we eat... before we go? This excitement's given me an appetite. D'Artagnan watches everything. We have to be lucky. Who? He's going to kill you, Aramis. Did she have tits like that? Aramis... These are... these are whores! Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there! Why didn't you say so? What use am I? Well... Well... Okay. But why? Athos, do you understand this? He confuses me -- The child of the king is... the king. Louis! I don't understand. What does this have to do with...? You carried a baby somewhere, it's unusual, but -- I remember that night. D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way. The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos? Aramis! Athos! He looks exactly like... exactly like... I expected action. There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless. It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be. But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King? A tomb? We're in a tomb? Mother of God! Where are we? Aramis... is this the way to hell? I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple. Forgiveness? Really? If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral. I just said you're praying! Are you deaf too? I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes. Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted. I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone -- It worked! So what? I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss. What choice is there? If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go. "Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon. At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes. That should give you ample time. Never have I needed more to say: One for all, and all for one. D'Artagnan." D'Artagnan, unready? I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here. Best not to ask. Shouldn't even talk about it. He gets one day of confession each year. Today is the day.Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along. Very. That was 'Joe'. Just plain 'Joe'? Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me. Unfortunately. I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal. He's coming. So I guess a blowjob's out of the question? Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now? Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed? And I don't mean you and me. I mean you and him. Yeah. Goodnight. No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know. That may be. But I don't like the fucker. I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you. And vice versa. Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got Joe. And so do you. Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations. -- Did I hear 'business'? Hello, Beautiful. Bontecou wants a speedier response than that. Thank you for coming. Am I not obligated to? Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow. There is a provisory by- law in our charter. Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five. The dagger --? I'm not stepping anywhere -- So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants. Not good, not bad, you know what we got? Nothing. No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives. Nothing. I'll make a note of it. Anything else? Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it? Who are we talking about? Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. And I'm expecting you won't mention it again. I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him. What are you, his shadow? Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak? You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P. That means without you. Okay, pal? Let's eat. May I interrupting? It doesn't matter. It's just a saying, Mr. Black, Yes. Yes. And a glass. Hot or cold. Anything else, Mr. Black? How about some water? The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order. Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and -- Nice to see you. I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing. 'Here'? Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying? Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill. I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already. Need any help with the details? What side of the industry did you say you were on? You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof. And what do I get? I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer -- Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another one of his whoppers? Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since. I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed -- Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday. But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you? Certainly, Bill. So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer? Don't you want to hear the details? Bontecou wants a quick response and -- Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill? Certainly. Goodnight. I'm just giving you the truth. There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth. Yours. With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor. What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that? If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer. Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs. Sure. I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day. Need a few minutes to sort everything out. Mind if I throw up? For how long? And why? As much as Joe's? I thought this was practically a done deal -- I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century. This merger is the vehicle -- How nice for you both. Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill. 'Just kidding'? But the matter's still on the table, Bill -- Glad I could be of some help. You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"? That's your privilege, Bill. But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes. ...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion. I get the feeling you've done some business before. Have we met? Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --' Is there any more to it? 'Joe...' What?! Yeah, something he goes by -- Olympic. So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right? You have a way with words. I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- Instead it was -- I'm all excited -- That's great! Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou. Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one. It's going to be great -- ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far? Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince -- I was saying to Quince we won't need -- 'Yes' to the deal? What'd it say? A voice? Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations? Yeah, the short, gray hairs. He said that? This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart. Go right ahead. Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting. And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company. The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard. Would you like to hear the silver lining? Check that, gold. I've been working with John Bontecou all along. We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder. I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park. Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs. That we did. Thanks to you. He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace. 'It's up to Joe'? -- But he was concerned about the timing? How did Bill react to the leads you've developed? You're on, Quin-cee. Destination Hospital. Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide. Okay? How's that sound to you? Yeah. Neat. Well, that's very interesting. 'It's up to Joe', huh? 'It's up to Joe'? Those were his words? Are you? Thanks, Quince. Joe, you do get around. You're overthinking it -- Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --Toast? No...just the butter. I would prefer some peanut butter. 'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'. You like it? What are you eating. Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you. I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home -- -- And now you're going to pee some more. No, I don't -- Perhaps you could remind me. Susan's patient is whom we are talking about. But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her. No. Yes. Then why did you bring it up? Of whom? What an odd pairing. "Death and Taxes"? Cold. Why yes, thank you. Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies? Thank you. Here... I didn't say. We have an arrangement now. Can do no right by people. Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go. Rahtid! Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back. Don' need you okayin'. She knows how she feel. I am. Yah. Mine, too. Yes. Nuthin'. No, I come to see Doctor. Don' be facety, woman. Not time yet. Can't, sistah. Doctor lady make it irey. I nuttin' to do wi' dat. No, no. I on holiday. I from dat nex' place. Obeah evil. I not evil. No. Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is. Oh yes, you are one of my favorites. What do you mean 'free'? 'The deepest, darkest secrets --'? But she loves you? How did you meet? You love Allison, don't you? Love. Do I? I'm a little confused. You're welcome. And you're a nice man, Quince. On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one. Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males. That's very gracious of you, Quince. It's so very nice to see you again. Black. As long as it takes. Are you? Yes? Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here. Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party -- Thank you for loving me. Susan -- I love you now, I'll love you always -- I'm still here. I - uh -- The 'coffee shop' -- Did I say that? I believe that, don't you? 'Love will find out the way'? What will we do? Will it? But there's so much to tell you -- We know so little about each other -- No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave. I can tell you the when part. Tonight. Well -- I -- Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end. I love you in an evening gown. Oh, I hope a long, long time. Nowhere? I'm...here. Yes! I loved it. ...No. Yes, he's tired. I believe so. He's taking a nap. How beautiful. I am. Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever. Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees -- Yes? Why, yes. Thank you. -- Could you? Thank you. I love your smell. Please. We don't need to talk about Drew. Almost. You first. Yes. I'm tired. To bed. No. No. No, I'm not. Why? I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back. I'm sorry to hear that. Has her pain abated? I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today. Yes...I've found that it does. Yes... I don't know. I mean I appreciate that. I appreciate you -- Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon. I wanted to apologize, Susan -- Be sorry for nothing. Not now. She's in a great deal of pain. I don't mind -- And I'll be a visitor. Whatever you do. Very well, I'll watch. I came to see you. Oh goodness, no. How nice you look. Is that your uniform? Yes? Goodnight to you, Susan. Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder? Susan? I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time. Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else. I don't have any. I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends. I'm sorry. Do you live here? When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing. Do you love Drew? I haven't. Peanut butter. That is not my intention. I am Joe. 'Big'? I'm sorry. I'm lost. Yes. Yes. Not exactly. Happy Birthday, Bill. An indictable offense. Undisclosed conflict of interest -- And we're very grateful. I'll take it from here -- I am -- Prepare yourself, Drew - I am -- It's time to put this person where he belongs. Okay. Are you threatening me? I don't like what you're saying. No. Susan wants to come. She says she's in love with me. Those were my words, Bill. So that's what love is? Which is what? Then what is it? I love her, Bill. She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand. I'm sorry, Bill -- I think you heard me, Bill. I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight. -- And I'm in love with your daughter. I was just asking, Bill. Not at all. Good. Tomorrow, after the party. You are? -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose. Uh -- I told you, 'watch it'. May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me. So watch it...Bill. I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references. This universe? I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life. And I find it eminently usable. 'Spooning'? With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission. I'll be the judge of that. Yes, I saw you see me. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not hungry. 'Fish'? What's okay? I'm sorry, Bill -- Goodnight. Um -- not right now. Hello, Bill. Are you going to fire me, Bill? You tell me, Bill. I wouldn't put it that way. I guess... I don't know. Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation. Okay. Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters? Absolutely. This part I'm interested in. Well...I don't know. And more. Uh-huh. Truly - uh - splendid. Excellent. What is it? Are you going to eat your lunch No thank you, Bill. I can manage. Oh. Okay. Of course. You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill? Are you sad, Bill? I don't understand. Yes. I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem. No. So can I. Can you keep a secret? What do you mean? I understand. That's what everybody says. That's what everybody says. Not this. Make an exception? Yes, Bill. So you've grasped the idea. Con- gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about. So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere. You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right? When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right? You've got a deal. Bill -- A 'deal'? Sounds fair enough. And what? Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night. I felt as if I were being treated like a person. 'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly. 'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel? Good morning, Bill. Good night to you, Bill. Not at all. I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time. Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad? That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering. You're putting me on the spot, Bill. I won't. No. What a good idea. It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for? No. I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him. 'Threw' you? Where? Thank you. No --You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party. I wasn't going to say -- I haven't been the father to you that -- Yeah? And what about my enemies? Do they, m'dear? It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean? Oh, the goddam party -- I don't like cake. Who's Annie? What is this? I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative. Of course. Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict. Who? We've got some things to discuss. -- Black. A name? Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it. I know you do, darling. What, honey? Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it. I hate parties -- Allison, I trust you. This is your thing. Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind? Hi, Allison -- I thought you were buying my company. I'm sorry, I don't recall -- Good, good. Glad to hear it. Proof? We've got plenty of proof. You get not to go to jail. No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal. The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all. In English, please. I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all. Are you running this Board or am I? Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question? I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. No, thank you. The answer is no, quick enough for you? That's it? I don't think so. Do you? I think it's time you went home, Drew. I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me. Whose? I don't care. Over my dead body. What are their feelings? What is there to say? They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow. Please, Drew. Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him. You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around. I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice. Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it. Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew. Why? Joe and I have no secrets from each other. Sit down, Drew. No. Shall we adjourn? I am now. Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field. No -- Uh -- he's from out of town -- What do you mean? Yes. Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head -- Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh -- this is -- As close as a deal could be. Like a marriage made in heaven? Me, too. Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time. Do you think I need a haircut? Sounds good. No no, not you. Did you just hear something? Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go. 'Yes'. In my sleep. 'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night. Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out. What? Good morning, Jennifer. Jennifer. -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight. No. Nothing. Sure. Hi, Jennifer. That's life. What can I tell you? I guess you have your reasons. Thank you. An offense -- Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest -- The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity. I agreed to cooperate. -- An IRS man. He is -- I told you to shut up. It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's going to step aside -- Joe, don't do this -- Get him in here. I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life. I don't expect you to. Does she know where she's going? With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are? Well, they're mine now. Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about. Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love. Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging. It's missing everything that matters. How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you. It's not love -- Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted. You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway? You're what? Say again? You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it. And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death. What the hell do you care? Thanks. Yeah. What are you saying, that it's time to go? Yes? Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch. And I don't give a shit. Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up. You're violating the laws of the universe. Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand -- Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter. I'm her father! Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman. I couldn't sleep. Then I can't help you. Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap. What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over. We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe? Just a manner of speaking. That's okay. Okay. Goodnight. Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap? How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire. What way would you put it? About Susan? You were just curious? Why did you go to the hospital? And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either! You! Drew! I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life. I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it. And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay? Dinner? Absolutely. I thought you'd heard a trillion times -- Why didn't you stop me? Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken. She knew stuff like that. Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan -- that was my wife -- Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard. It's all yours. Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city. Now I'd like to be alone. Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you. Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines? ...I'd like to be alone for a while. -- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end? Would you like to sit down, Joe? What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board. Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --? Yes. What's it like where I'm going? What's it like? I want to live. I'm not everybody. -- I don't deserve this. I'm still young, this is not my time -- There's one to every rule. How about giving a guy a break? Joe --? Of course. I guess so. What do you mean? Yes? You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say. It's a truth exchanged between two people. It is a deal? And I won't tell anyone who you are. Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family? How are you? How're you feeling? Good morning. And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'. Well, thank you for letting me know. Closer than that. No -- ...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine. When you go, I go. How long have I got? If there is anything else, don't hesitate -- Thank you. Would you like the man's name? I wish you had said something to me about staying here -- So there's nothing between you and Susan? Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything -- ...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me. Joe, that's the kitchen. Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite -- When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner. It just occurred to me -- Excuse me? Could I say something? This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us. And then --? I do? How long will you be staying? You want me to be your guide --? You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants. Death! You are --? You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you? Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream? The 'question' -- What question? Yes what? I'm sorry -- What the hell are you talking about? Get what? 'The one' to do what? 'Take me'...? Where? About what? What the hell is this? Who are you? What is this, a joke, right? Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and -- Where are you? Know what? Know what, goddammit! What do you mean?! Please. Talk to me -- Where are you? Are you there? I'm sorry, I -- What are you talking about? I don't! I didn't ask any question. 'Yes' what? What? Quince, I've got confidence in you. All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings. Yes, I believe I do. Sure. It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong. This one. Yeah, I give a shit. No thank you, Quince. I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whatever cake you like? No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe. Next week? Thank you, Quince. How's that, Quince? I'm doing great. You ready? Good morning, Quince. Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for. I just wanted to set the record straight. I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time. As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not. Either way, thanks. Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory. If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it. Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over. Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this -- Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here? Eddie? Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie. Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit. Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we? What was that? If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me. I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan? That's why it's okay. No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. -- And I have no regrets. I want you to know how much I love you. That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me. Yes, but -- I'm sorry. I'm having a helluva time. I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you! In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I just can't help you. I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground. I don't know, I can't say -- Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long. You don't know anything about Joe -- This is crazy -- I don't understand. I don't know. Joe? Then what is it? Nothing. I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate -- I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground -- What is the nature of your interest in Joe? Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag? That was wonderful. Will it?... Cut it out, Susan. You and I've got to talk. Big day tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go. Uh - will that hold you, Joe? What?! You know each other? Yer damn right. A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action. Nothing. Nothing. I'm sorry. He doesn't care. But thanks anyway. I know. But I'm the only father you've got. You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton. Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike. Aw, you're tough. I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived. Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be. Well, it worries me. I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish. Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice. That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say. Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it. Well, I wasn't going to say that -- Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful -- Don't get carried away. Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him? Do you love Drew? I know it's none of my business -- I am. With you. Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started. Not my birthday again? I don't like to interfere. You like him, don't you? Does Drew tell you everything? How did you know? Drew's aboard? Hi, honey.But what? You know what I'm saying, Joe? Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen. No jocks? A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion? Someone I could talk to. Or would talk to me. He said he would be there with bells on. Okay. All aboard - New York, New York! Both. Okay, give me a bottle of wine. 9:30's almost 10:30. Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit. What do you do that for? And that? ...This shit's not bad. Well, you've got him by the short- hairs. He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary. I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you. But I didn't mean to do it! I'm going to put a stop to this! What have you done? You've gotten the old man fired! That's what he said. The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe. He was interested. Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news. As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger. I'd like to come, too. See Susan strut her stuff. I thought so, too. Joe's a neat guy. Yeah, that's what he said. Yeah. We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe. Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man. ...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up. Well, I guess he's found one. I don't think they're ordinary. I love keychains. I know. Gum up the works. Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited. So what do you think, is it -- -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me? Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party? You think so? How do you know? What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you. Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place. He was setting up Bill from day one. Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside. And I was the fool who made it all happen. Oh God, what do I do? Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear. Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free. Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter. I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in. Oh yes, I do. 'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own. Confused, huh? About what? C'mon, have a drink. You look like you need one bad as me. Thanks. You're an original, Joe. A little hard to figure, maybe... I didn't know that. No problem. I'll leave you two alone. I can tell you guys have something on the fire -- Don't bother asking, we already tried. Hey, this is fun. How long you here, Joe? You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League. 'Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952. Sir, I'll deliver the package. You think Drew will go for it? Joe knew the whole story. I told him. It was his idea that I come clean. I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean? Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill? ...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry? I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted -- The vodka. What'd I tell you? See. There. What'd I tell you? But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill? This is great, honey. The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world. Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard. Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner. Yeah. Or the week after. But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed. I want to talk to you about them next week. ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent. Bontecou Day. Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants. I am, this is it. B Day. How're you doing--? Hi, Bill --Then don't. Speak up, please. Of course. Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family. And that's what we're doing. It's not open for discussion. Nothing is. Don't you understand? You should hope quite a while. You fill the bill, Bill. The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took. Let me ask your opinion. Do I blend in? That's me. Yes. '...Yes --' I am not a dream. But we've got time. Y'didn't? You said you liked me. Why not? Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor? I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor. Because I don't want you to examine me. Did I say something wrong? You never know. Lightning could strike. I would. I know what you're saying. Doesn't pay very well. Depends on the woman I marry. Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap -- ...It's kind of a pro bono job. And I want to get into my apartment and go to work. Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee? How 'bout another cup of coffee? -- This is my lucky day. I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well. 'Her'. So if I needed a doctor, you could be it? Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers. The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor? Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her. I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy. He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him. Why? Nothing lasts. Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it? My kid sister. She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school. Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating' about it? Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.Jack -- I'll go with you. All you gotta do is get in. At least. From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too. What? Come <i>on</i>. They look like plain old rocks. Yeah, hi. Nice house. They found the safe. I don't ski. I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes. And who watches your back? Half for doing what? But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do? You know they gonna set us up. Whatta you wanna do? So what's that mean? That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks? You find out? Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at. So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal? And she saw you? It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes? Yeah, and I better call my sister. They put a gun on you, you'll go back. You might not have a choice. My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack? I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing. I say let fate decide. What about that D.B. Cooper guy? Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life. Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us? No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system. Now that's a really big house. Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up. Forty-five minutes. Two hours. Just hung up. They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it. She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather. Outside of that. What's he do now, tell fortunes? Or two. Whatta you think? "Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying." Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge. Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him. They'd been together ten years. They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way. He isn't fighting no more. Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk. Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc? I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go? Now you're talkin'. Sure looks that way. There. You see the guy sitting on the porch? The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere. You at least bring the gun? Nice disguise. And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel. So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans. Jack? He knows where she lives? He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you. You better come see this. Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both. Am I going to Detroit by myself? You'll have to ask Glenn. And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be. Just that she got away. Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu. Maybe this'll make you feel better. They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you. There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back. There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean? There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate. There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink. You're right. Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move. You're too late, Jack. You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up? You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"? He ain't the problem, Jack. How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with? I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac. You wanted to take her car. The green-and-whites saw us. One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? Ties it to the break and turns around... Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there? We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where? That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car. Why don't we talk about it later? The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize him without his rug.And you let them come up. You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand? Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do? You can go wait out in the car, you want to. Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator. Yeah, why? You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man. You get the key? Good. Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel. Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force. What? Is that what you're calling me about? Now. What is it you wanted to tell me? But don't you do anything. You just have a seat, wait for me to get there. There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there. We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale. I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy. If he does, you call me right away... What-- we already talked to her. That's a dead end. Where are you? I been trying to reach you. Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you. Sounds to me like he liked having you around. I'll see you, Karen. Mr. Sisco. We'll talk another time, Karen. All right? I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more. I have to qualify, is that it? Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations. You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too. The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand. You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then? Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him. Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that? This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies? What'd you talk about? You talked to him? There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is it? And this fella Jack Foley. I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time. Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this? That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head. Daniel Burdon, FBI.Karen, I told you not to-- We're a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand? That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone. Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side. Who was the friend? Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too. Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse. You know, I'm not in homicide any more. Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI? Yonelle. Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window. Fuckin' animals. Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes. Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation. Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie. Freezing. But I'm getting warmer. Ironic, isn't it?He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em. I might not even take 'em off first. Glenn Michaels. What're you talking about? Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now. So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing... What happened to Mandrake the Magician? Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world. I said not as a rule. You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on tonight , eight-thirty. That's funny, Adele. How many more times you gonna gimme that one? Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month. Let me do this part alone. No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars. I'm going back inside. We made it, didn't we? And then they'll kill 'em. They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they. Shit. They sure do. You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard? Stay with the maid. I'm gonna have a look around. You ever wear one of these? There's still time, take me up on my offer. Getting me out of Glades for starters. I'll make you a deal. Get out of here. Right now. I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half. I get that feeling, yeah. They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth. I don't know. Yeah, I did. It wasn't about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different. You know how I felt about her. Yes, she did. I saw Karen Sisco. Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later? They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you? Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it. Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now? Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life? Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it. Do you? Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone . Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way. Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison. Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look. Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it. You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you? 'Cause I don't wanna go through that again. How long were you with the girl? How long you talk to her? You tell your sister about it? I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you? Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us. Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag? I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner. Love is funny. She just sat there, looking right at me. Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now. Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking. First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of. Let's go to Detroit. I guess Adele's in good hands. Uh-huh... In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. That's her place. I'm a tourist. Shit. Her phone's probably tapped. We were talking one time, drinking rum. I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got interested. He's like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit. He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades. He does, he's gonna try to find me. Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows. Chino's gonna wanna talk to me. What?! We'll leave first thing in the morning. Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries. Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn? Say anything in there about Karen Sisco? I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life. Sounds great. I know exactly what you mean. It's just a feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight. Oh, man. I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months. Soak the prison off me. You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you. I'm just saying she wasn't scared. I want to talk to her again, that's all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances. I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out. His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out. Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know. Wait a minute. Let me have your raincoat. Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes. Do we need him? Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is. She's coming with us. Okay, honey, come on out of there. Where in the hell are we? I bet that's all the hacks they send out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store. It's Richard Ripley. I appreciate the offer. And it's tempting. You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out. You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event. Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance. Yeah, but I see you moved it up. You excited? You're right. So why take a chance-- A little. Not until recently. Good luck, Richard. I've seen 'em used on TV. That's a wonderful story, Snoop. I'm very excited about tonight. So you've done this before, huh? That what they're wearing these days to break and enter? I wasn't asking permission. Give me a minute, talk to Buddy. I thought everything. Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is... We're leaving. Who's sitting here? What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm. Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you. Glenn didn't tell you? Like being back in the yard, huh? Low class of people there, Snoop. Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower. Thirty-two outta what, twenty? I don't smoke. I bet. How much? How much for your company at chow? Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks for a pillow? Yeah. Sign says "Shut the fuck up." Or can't you guys read? You just did, for Christ sake. I told you, I'm not going back. If you don't, one of those guys will. Pretend I'm somebody else. You know. You getting serious on me now? I don't know about that. You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain. What about <i>my</i> motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will? Why are you mad? You coming back? Don't talk like that, okay? You scare me. I don't think we should get into that. To warn her about Chino. Outside Adele's. You know I saw you on the street. Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while. I wasn't sure you caught that. I don't know. I hadn't worked that part out yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again. Why not? I hear he didn't mean to. The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart. I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy. Yeah, but in a nice way. She did, huh. That's not what you were about to say. So do you. It would be worth the risk. Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink. I called your room from downstairs. It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?" It might happen only a few times in your life. It's not a game. Something you play. I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything? How far do we go with this? Having it cleaned didn't help, huh? You did? I like your hair. And that suit. A girl. Is that how you think of yourself? Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living? You like bourbon? Those guys bother you? I can go to the bar. I just thought maybe you and me could-- I'm partial to mountains myself. But if you like islands, we'll make it an island. He's dead. He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed. That's not gonna be me. Why? You think he might tell you where I am? I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters. Because you're having too much fun. You won't do that. Sure. I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door. How do we do that? And your gun. Really. He has a cop's face. I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you. Who was it answered the phone? You know who this is? Shit... Uh-huh. Well, but if -- Really. Yeah... Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>. I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances... I mean if you didn't know who I was. You're sure easy to talk to. I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen. It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you. Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot? I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to. And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody... Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV... That part in the movie where they get shot? Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name. You're full of interesting facts, aren't you? Is that right? Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde? Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat? You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him. Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence. We still talk, though. It was just a year, give or take a few days. I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything. We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know? That spark, you know what I mean? You gotta have that. Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife. You don't act like it. You don't seem all that scared. Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that? I believe you would have. Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc. And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went. I thought so, too. Tell you the truth, I don't know. I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus. They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola. Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer. Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me. One I gave him, yeah. Fuck... Who, Buddy? Yeah. He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail. She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob. If they get set up in time, which I doubt. And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford. Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you. I've never done that in my life. Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall? Boy, it stunk in there. Where's your gun, your pistol? You devil, it's mace, huh? What've you got here, a billy? Use it on poor unfortunate offenders. There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can? You comfy? Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun? Why? Just because you left us standing on the side of the road? Whose blood you got all over you? What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em? Yeah? She said that to you? Weren't you expecting us? The backseat. I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that? Take her with you and put her in back. Wait in the car. You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head. Take your sunglasses off. Oh, nuthin'. Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else. Use your head. The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it? My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with. Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks. I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights. Who you talkin' to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I can't tell, you got those shades on. I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down. Looks like tonight. I hear six. I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details. Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when? Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you. I were you, I'd get up and run. Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard? I'm not angry, Richard. In fact, I'm completely relaxed. Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there. Siddown, Dick. They're trying to open the safe, not your maid. You gonna write me a check? A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were. What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night? Maurice Miller, couple of his friends. How are you, Richard? Oh, yeah, I'm calm. In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..." How, Dick? The way you earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. Till you were nothing. I saved your ass. So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there." Okay, Dick? I can't do it. You goin' right back to work? I still haven't made up my mind yet. The next time I walk into a bank. And the guy sent you a bill for this? I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before. The fish? My ex-wife's in Miami. It's nice down there. I don't know. I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type. It's a little late for me. Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why? Doesn't have to figure out shit. You told him you keep 'em at your house. Of course not. You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute. No? Where do you keep it, Dick? I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about. You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way. I don't know. I never used a gun. Any time. First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you. You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off. Must be a real soft pillow. You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer. I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida. Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about. She did, huh. And so now you're off to Glades. You must be some kinda walker, Henry. The ninth ? There were others. And how long was it before they caught up with you? You busted out? Meaning? You were at Leavenworth, huh? The flight? What's it mean, "No Hair"? <i>Hejira?</i> What kinda name is that?I thought you guys were busted. These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit. I don't know... She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust. She drove me to court. Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike? "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled." That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake? In the trunk? You're in civilization now, man, ease up. I see better with them on. Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on? You think he's lying? So. What's your point? Detroit. Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash. I'll take the shades off. Just get this fuckin' thing off me. You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy! He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check. Like that, fifty mil, signed his name. Whoa-- little help here! I know, you'll find me. Jesus, I believe it. I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am. Really? I'm freezing my ass off. I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me. Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward. He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him. Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I don't give a shit what they do. Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle. Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here. Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals. You're gonna bust me for picking up a car? Jesus. How'd you know about Snoopy? I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I? I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car. Jesus, I don't believe it. No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in. What am I supposed to do now ? We're not. I'm helping him, yeah-- I remember you now. Shit. But you're sure we've met, huh? It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there. I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me. I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January-- Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer? Why would I do that? It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car. Why'd he have to do that to that girl? I think you're forgetting, this is my car. I drove it up here. I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job. You're either in or you're not. You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine. What-- when? Can I do what? Me? Wait a minute. I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends. What? So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it? If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open. Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it. You there? It's Richard Ripley. It's a guy you know. I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big. I wanna talk to you about a job. Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash. Snoopy. Glenn Michaels.Like what? Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van. Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait. Hejira. Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from. Yeah. That was the ninth. That time? I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place. Meaning time came, I left. For a time. The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name. The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622. Islamic.My little girl, the tough babe. I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can. You gonna go get him? He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one? So? I imagine you would've though. You wave back? He waved to you? Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike. It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping. You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack. Maybe. But you're also curious about the man. Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him. You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it. But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again. He remind you of that guy, Tillman? Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you think he's a nice guy. No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her? I bet nothing. So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out. You think that's possible? What kind of guy is he? Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you. Off a tip? I see that. No? Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas. What are you thinking about? "Hey, yourself." You were talking in your sleep. I'd like that. We don't get to talk much any more. You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced. Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em. You used to like it. You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators. What're you doing at Glades? Then they're not separated, are they? Oh, he's moved out? He's still married though, huh? Which one is that? The ATF guy? Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke? It's a -- Something better. Open it. So the woman's married. She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. But you don't reveal her name, you protect her. It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her. That's how you score now? ...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa. She says he was very gentle. Did you pay the guy the reward? I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward. In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"? Likewise.This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you? Nervous? Jack, you don't use a gun, do you? Someone down here? You know how to use one a these? Hey. You learn from doing. Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor. Shit, yeah. White Boy even got busted for it. White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time. Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it's done. Don't waste any time. That's how you do it. You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind. Soon as we leave here. Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it. Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know? The fuck you talking about? Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push him off. Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back. Warm? Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns. No, I ain't talking any business in here. To me this is holy ground, man. You understand? I got to be someplace anyway. Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater. Let's go outside and talk. Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold? It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh? Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system. This doesn't concern you, Foley. Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke? Another C. Company, shit. I watch the man's back. That's right. There a problem, Foley? No. You gonna stay close to me from now on. So you don't disappear on me. Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl. That was some shit, huh? Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this car, man, it's mine. You go get yourself another one. I say I'm in on Ripley? I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass. I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do? Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want. Right now, son. Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own. Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk. Thing I'm worried about is you. You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how. We the experts. I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there. You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself? It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros. I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left. Yeah. The brick wall. There's his drive, right there. Watch the road, boy. I like this Town Car. We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass. Oh, I'm here, all right. I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here? Gimme another hint. Some one ? Gimme a hint. Uh-huh. You crazy, come up here ? It's fuckin one degree outside. Studs. Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends. I was just thinkin' about you. A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right... Okay, on three: One... Two... How do I look, mama? Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in the closets. The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere. Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in. You here all by yourself? When's he due back? Out for the evening? Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley? Where the fuck is Foley? Forget about her. Tell me where the money's at. Where you been hiding, Dick? Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself. Yeah. Sure. It's all settled. Faux goose down. ...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's. That Bausch & Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks. Whoever. The point is, prices are goin' up, too. Better get your little black book out, Richard. We got some business to talk about. Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up. Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase. ...the fuck is this... White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress. I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads. Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or alive? White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again? Jack Foley, famous bank robber.If that's my fate, so be it. I'm not leaving. I love her, Jack. I'm not leaving Midge. Five point two. I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time. Good God... they're shooting Midge! We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal. What do you want from me, Jack? Name it. You want money? We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida. Have they got Midge up there? Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God. Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs? Foley? That you? Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down now. Haven't we, Jack? Jack, I'm disappointed. I guess I misjudged you. Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage. You think you're better than that? Fine. Show me. Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better. But first, Jack, you gotta earn it. First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons. What's to think about? It works. You should try it sometime. The fish saved my life. Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure. So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out. Yeah, fish live in the present. They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow. Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved. No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it. They accept. No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen. Who is? But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work. You gotta look at it as peace of mind. As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean? I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick. Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two. Forty-two. You really want to change, it's never too late. I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. I'm talkin' about when you're outta here. I mean, you can't rob banks for ever. Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here? It's a big house. Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em. Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn? I know what you're talking about. You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks. Really? Tell me something. What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up? Thanks for your help. Really? Well, I uhhh... Sounds high, doesn't it? Oh, uh, right, thanks... Foley's got it. Midge. Are those <i>my</i> suits? Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing? Still... Well, I need that... I think it's Dunn & Brad street. But then, I could be wrong... What? Thank you...Are they dead? I found a rubber. I think he must've fell in. Ten gees. We have a problem here?Not me. You work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement. Are you alright? I didn't say I was. Don't even think that I'm buying that. Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission? Check this out. Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently. When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything. Then the wall goes down. No more Cold War. And Gregor is out of a job. No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes. I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up. And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think... Because if they had she'd be gone along with the package, instead of sitting here with us. Now, what did we steal? Duty calls? You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me. You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre. And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now. Part of me says I should just look at this as a perk. You know, a bonus. But then I remember you're you -- Deirdre who used to belong to the IRA -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you. Is that right? I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed. We weren't real thrilled about it either... Hazard pay... Once. Sam. I'm a weapons guy. Sent it where? Then where is it? Bullshit! Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!? You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive. I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you. So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people. I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money... A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior. I'm just a killer for hire. The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival. Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself. And I'm not any kind of Samurai. Created? So what is it you want to know? If I was healthy, I could take that away from you. So this is what, a test? Vincent told you that I'm a cop? I didn't expect that he would. It gets done now or not at all. Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them. Yeah. Soon. Some, thanks. Enough to move on, for now. Then if you don't mind... I'm gonna pass out. You think you can stitch me up on you own? No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control. Alright, let's do it. American. Did he bring that with him? It's a cocktail. Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future. My way is better. It's been known to happen. Long enough to shoot back. All in the stomach, though. Your man might live. You shoot alright. The point remains: we could be working for different people. There's a chance for one of us... Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others. I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for. It can help prevent a great deal of... ...unpleasantness. I told you, I quit. Gone. Destroyed. I don't know. Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us. There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon. You better get some sleep, alright? You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it. You stepped in front of a bullet for me. I owe you a heavy debt. What of it? What? And now... Let's get him out of here... I'll work on it... No, I don't. That's a good question. And yet you would have killed him to save my life. You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore. I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with. All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job. It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto. Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not? Because I don't walk away. The mark of a true Samurai. What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do. We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job. Would you stop with that... Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette. Time to quit. Not here. They might see it. Yeah. We need out fucking heads examined. In a minute. No you don't, and you know it. I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you. This is my job, I have to do it. Business keeps you on the road? Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!! Give me a cigarette. I don't know... You said it yourself: Gregor's not dead. If they had the package, they'd have killed him. They don't have the package. How could you have done that? You would have done that? You were behind the door? I never made that claim. It is at that. Dark operations. Wet work. Kidnaping. Assassination. I'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed. I do dark ops. Sure I do. You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said. It's my job. Do what? You sure your friend got the right place? Thorough man. What's this? The Irish representative? I know of him. Good. Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine. I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field. There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me. Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out. You see the bullet? You don't have to do this. This doesn't involve you, don't you understand? I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this. We? There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me. My job, Vincent, a job you don't need to know about. I can't go to the local cops -- they'd never be able to get close enough at this point. It's me or nobody, and I've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish. If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago. This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do. Not exactly. No hospitals. I'll fix this myself if I have to. You know one around here? Somebody you trust? I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit. But you can't. It's Paris. The route's too indirect for anything else. A guy like Gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. Otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. He's going to Paris. Now I just hope we can find him before he gets there. He's going back. You might be a hired gun, Vincent, but I got a feeling you cost more than two bits. We live in a singular world, my friend. You don't. You just learn to live with it. I've seen a lot of people die before. It was at that. I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own. I borrowed that, too... I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table. I came up here to sneak a smoke. What's going on? Gregor's cell phone... Because that's what I would have done... I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head. I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy. Know what? Well I ain't a cop. You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit. You need to know a lot of shit, Vincent. See what? What's going on? They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up. Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless. That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow. Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it. Somebody's paying through the nose for this. Who am I? I've wondered that myself. None of this answers my question, though... Why bring me? Deirdre? Smart, yeah, and seriously goddamned dangerous. Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB. He's smart, Gregor is. Exactly. Why not bring them? So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride? Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening. A tough guy. It has it's moments. Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side. I do. I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week. One's a lot more painful than the other. Not at all. Similar, but not the same. Jujitsu. What'd you say to him? I don't. But the language he's speaking is universal. And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh? As in, they own it? That's what I thought. I can do that. Where to? Coordinate what? He trusts you to lock up? No thanks. I know cops -- and you're no cop. Who else would you be? Sorry I'm late... Seamus Reilly. It's the Irish tape we want. Why's that? I'm sure. Gaelic. What's the story?Do I need to repeat myself? Shut up!!! Shut up and drive! I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!? Plastic fucking surgeon? You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass? It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge. As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over. Good Christ! Can't you lose these jokers? About time! Lose them! From Interpol? What in bloody hell is going on? Nothing. Problem my ass! I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man! I thought I did. It's been known to happen. It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you. You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note. There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it. Now there's the Deirdre I know. Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him. What's a little hate between business partners? What am I doing here? Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia. See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together. You've told me a lot of things, boyo... This better be the real thing or you're a dead man! If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car. You slept with the fucker!! You should have kill him when you had the chance. But no... How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us? Why didn't you kill him?I'm up for that... So where do you go from here? I don't want you dead, woman, I want the the truth! And I don't believe you... When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show. And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on. Finding this package is a thing easier said than done. We don't even know what it is. What did we steal? And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned. While Sam and I take out the back two cars... We kept it... Of course. Then you better find it in your heart to tell me, Francois, because while your death is inevitable, it still isn't decided how painful it's going to be. Where's my information? I take it you still want the money... What's that? Here's yours. What do you mean? He's company. Do you have it? How did you know? Not exactly. Of course. Don't you? Yes, Sam's tough alright. Hello, Jean-Pierre. Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone. How about you? I thought all you IRA types smoked. I guess that's for the best. What happened to it? Tell me something first. The package: what was it? I know. "Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you. Nothing... You speak French. You son-of-a-bitch... Finish it! Finish the job... You have to stop doing that! Do you have a good answer? And when you finish? What then? This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA? Do you really think they deserve it? Closest and oldest. Why not? Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other? Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for. Why? You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen. You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia... And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that. What of it? Samurai pain in the ass. Just like that? If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking. Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing. Do we need anything else? I think not. If our positions were reversed, would you leave me? So I do it. Something like that. I'm not here very much. Why are you driving? You're not French, you don't live here, you don't know these roads. Why are you driving? Right now? You don't know? Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out. What the fuck happened? You think? Because I owe you. Look at that... I would have tried not to. But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have. I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to. I know. Jean-Pierre did. Not very zen of you, huh? Not so much the modern Samurai after all. Very ugly. Dark ops? It's a cover, then. A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint. You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer. Then quit. You don't work for Interpol, Sam. Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up. Tell me, Sam: why do you do this? If Tony says this is it, then it's it. The address of the Russian production company. Just in case we need to find them. Yes. You know him? Clearly. Alright, it's done. Yes I do. It isn't about money for me, not anymore. I'm going with you. It looks to me like we're all that's left of our group. And what job is that? You're with Interpol -- you're a cop. Fix it yourself? Why are we even doing this? There's no need to run, Christ... You're a cop. No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital. You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor. That makes twice now you've saved my life. You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you. Not necessarily. He could go off road at any number of places. He might not even be in the country anymore. I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth. I'm a hood, a thief. Big time in a small time king of way. To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend. But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun. I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't. I haven't. Not like that. How do you get used to it? A lot of people died. Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself. Please, help yourself. Smoke as many you'd like. You were smoking? You weren't around when I woke up, I thought maybe something had happened. This has been one very fucked up job, Sam, and I'm not taking any more chances on anybody... Including you... The question still remains: what do we do now? But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did? That there was a gun pointed at me. How did you know? I needed to see if you were a cop. I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together. And that's the guy you have to watch out for. I hate cops... I needed to know. I just wanted to see something. Lovely, isn't it? They certainly are. Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something. You were once some kind of special forces. Airborne Ranger, maybe a Navy SEAL. After that you rode shotgun for the CIA in some place like El Salvador or Afghanistan, a real mercenary. Only now -- now you're like the rest of us, it's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war. There's a lot of hired guns out here, and not nearly enough work to go around. I wanted to see who you were. I wonder if she truly left the IRA. So is the woman. Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited. Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this. Like Larry or Swede. There is that. Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse. It's just so damned pleasurable. A cigarette? As in one? One cigarette a week, who smokes like that? Help yourself. Since when do you smoke? What's the difference? Same thing, isn't it? That was a nice move you did on our young friend. Judo? I asked if we could give him anything else. I didn't know that you spoke French. Something like that... He says this is their block. Pretty much what you'd expect. To see a man about a thing. Things. This is my country, you know. I'm Vincent. And I coordinate. Let's just say he knows who I am. Cigarette? Perhaps the police? What makes you think we're here to meet you? You put everything on the line because you... You slept with her! You slept with her! Why didn't you kill her? It's a matter of respect. Why don't you wait outside, this won't take long. Tony and I have to talk some business, first. I get the picture. Can you get it? You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape? Do you have the tape? I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new. A friend. I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes. I'm alright. And you?I don't know what you're - Dwayne listen to me - I can't get enough of it. Damn. None of them had any -- Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here -- one of them's still alive. Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin? Rock solid. Uh huh. I can't. I can't go on. I can't keep lying...killing. That's not me. That's not US. It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that? It's about Yes it is. I'm calling it in. Right now. It's too late... What are you talking about? Dwayne's dead. No. It stops now. It stops here. He killed her... He found us, he shot her...he killed her... He killed her...he killed her... Then Sally comes too. We've got to go now, then. We're not? How do you figure that? Then we're screwed. It was all used. Random numbers. How can they trace it? I sure as hell hope so. Let's go. Maybe we should say somethin'. You don't know if he was really gonna -- Jesus Christ Earl...what are we doing?... Like hell it is. This is Jesse! Jesse! You killed him... Here it is. What are you thinking? We were only supposed to scare him! How long is it going to take?! Not bad enough to kill him. You're crazy. Well what are we supposed to do? Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape. Look, Earl. We gotta go straight. This is all messed up... No. Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse. You said that last time! We had a deal! What was I, talking to the wall? He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not. He's probably made copies. He's not going to give them up to us. And how do you figure we do that? ...Or get rid of the money. I don't know. Well doesn't he? Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now. Just call it the cost of doing business. This whole thing is screwed up. I'm thinking. Maybe we should tell 'em the truth... All right enough! I'm tired of thinking about all this! He would have done it to us, right? That's not what I mean. I can't do that. You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one. What are you thinking? He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it! I should have known something like this was going to happen! It's the right thing to do. We gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape. Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl. I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape... We assaulted a Federal agent. We killed him. That guy was a Federal agent. An officer of the law, just like us. This isn't a joke. What are we going to do! We're dead. We're dead, We are dead... What are we going to do?! Forget it. We're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down. And no one, I mean no one hears a word about it. Understand? Look. Dwayne was right. This is going to be a big story. So big in fact that I don't want to even have this money around. I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that! We tried to murder someone to cover our asses! That's not what I mean. I...I can't do that. You're thinking about killing him. I can't do that. No way. I've never killed a man. Never even shot at one... What are you thinking? He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it! He saw everything! Well, I don't know. I'm putting it out of my mind and you should too -- Shhh! We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions. I've got one condition. I don't know. Torch it?! I do. It's little shit like that sends people to jail! We have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this! All right hold on! Lemme think... Shit, did you touch the car? At the expense of six people. Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks? What makes you so sure? It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it? Suppose someone knows about the money? They're bound to ask questions. I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why! It won't work. Well someone's gonna find them. We don't know that. We don't know whose money it is! They might have robbed a bank, who knows? No. We can't. Call it in I guess. Why? What do you mean what are we going to do? Shit, more than that. Ten thousand right here. What the hell... I probably would have. I guess the clues damn near before everyone. Never heard of it. Cash and what? Seven thousand... I hear you. Well I hope so. That pretty much cleaned me out. The horniest dog in Nevada. Don't spend it all in one place. Sure thing, and -- What are you doing, Earl? Whoa, Earl! Shut up, Jesse. Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that! You don't expect us to believe that do you? No. It's not. Just take it in stride. None of us like it! What are you proposing? Two thousand... How much? That's the deal. If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins. We're going to wait. All of us, until everything dies down. All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition. What's your offer, Jesse? Why don't you get to the point. Yeah? So? What's that? You mean that guy was an agent? Could it have been in the Mercedes? No. Why? How are ya? Sally, do you love me? I swear to you, it's true... Things just got a little screwed up, that's all. Yeah. I want to tell you everything. Yeah, it is... We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met. Sally there's a whole world out there. We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump. What are you giving up? Why does that bother you? It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here... Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe. I'll be there for you. He won't try anything while I'm there. I promise. I'll protect you. I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him. Well I was just throwing out ideas... I love you Sally. We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside... Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place. We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish... It doesn't matter...he's next to you. You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you? Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you. Dammit, I'm so sick of this. Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all. Great... How the hell did he find it? You're worth every last penny. There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here. And I'd take it out on him. That son of a bitch. Like hell it's over. You told me he wasn't doing this anymore. Nothing happened? What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing... You deserve it is the occasion. Sally? I was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave. I love you too. I'm just tired is all. I'll see you tonight OK baby? Yeah I'm fine. OK. Nothing's wrong. Nothing. I know. Yeah. Hi. I might have to look into that... No. But he would, probably. Ah hell, he'd do the same for me. Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind. They're going to take his car. Yeah but I need to take out four hundred dollars and the ATM will only give me three. I gotta take some money out, that's what for. I have to go to the bank before it closes.Don't lie to me!!!! Shut up! Not another word out of you! You're going down, the Feds know all about it! You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest? I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you! Whatsamatter with you? Aren't you concerned about all of this? I want to get some hounds down here. I'd like to know what they were doing in my town! Did you get ID off any of them? What the hell happened here? Sort of! What do you think about all this? This just might be our ticket! We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity. Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads... Jesus, seven dead. I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts. I don't like it. Not in my jurisdiction. Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that. All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf. Did you say After Midnight? Fine. The information doesn't leave this room. Dwayne. Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here. Have you known this all along? Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all. Maybe I should come along. Why would someone do that? What are you getting at? Don't you think I would have told you that! Well we'd like to help you in any way we can. We're all in this together, as law enforcement officers. Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that. I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved -- Excellent. I'll go down with you. That's news to me. So it's over at Jesse's office? I guess we can get started. Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT Lingerie... What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something? So there was money there! Who the hell's money is it?! Is this marked money, or what? A lot of men come in here? I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff. Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not. No I don't. You sure you haven�t seen her? Yeah I'd say C...C. Uh...C? Oh. Shopping here? I don't suppose you've seen her. Yeah, she is. She comes up to about here on me. Sixty five... Jeez Louise! Well I don't know... I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special. Well I just uh, you know... Hi. You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich. Something wrong, Jesse? Nice of you to join us. I did say three o'clock, didn't I? I have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding. So be here at three. Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can. Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us. Vegas! Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock? Jesse? She's not his type. Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse? Take it or leave it. Dammit you�re persistent. I don�t want to listen to this anymore. No more bets with you. All right you�re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal? He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play. Just goes to show you. Calm down -- You'd do this to me! You'd do this to me?! Shut up!!! Slut!!! You shut your mouth you son of a bitch! Save me the sermon. I've heard it all before, it's boring. Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace! Is that asking too much? Yeah let's hear about your day. Well you might as well say it. Mister Small Time... Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you. Not much to tell. Nothing really happened. Nothing. Nothing's the matter. SALLY Aren't you going to tell how your day went? Watch that. Watch that tone. What are you saying? A surprise huh? Well I don't like any surprises, especially if I'm forking over the loot for them! Forget it. Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing? Hey where's the hot pad? What's this?And you're solid on that? That'll bring me down, too. Eventually. You gotta know that. Just one more. This one knocks off all the rest. You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth. We're home free! We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours. It's NOT too late! Dwayne had the opportunity, just like us. He was at the scene. He grabbed the cash. Of course. This is perfect! I know, I know. Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it. We'll pin it on him. The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone. No radio. They couldn't have called me in. What do you mean? Look. We can make still make it work. We got to get out of here. Do you understand? We got to get out of here right now! Booth, listen to me...Booth! What happened? What's Earl doing here? Oh Jesus... That's right. We'll take the money and disappear! We can do it, spend it on the move. Even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it. No we're not. I don't know. They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays. I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank? Do you have everything? Come on. Booth grabs the bag -- Yes I DO! It never woulda stopped, you know that. Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives. We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves! It's gonna be o.k. Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up! There it is...now what about the others? I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk. I don't know! Shit, give me a break! Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight... How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail? I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl -- I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch! Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do. If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that! Neither do I. You think he's bluffing? You're out of your mind. Well I mean it this time. Come on. Let's get this over with! For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all! You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down. He's going to be trouble. Forget the copies! He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original. All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape. We'll set him up somehow. I've got a better idea. All we have to do is straighten out Jesse. Well I'm not! Thinks he's got us by the balls. I could kill that no good son of a bitch! Exactly. This is our little secret, partner. Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do. Okay then. I'll do it. Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's just a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway. I don't know... Shit! We're gonna have to get rid of him. I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life. We can't risk it. How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! Man take it easy! You're sweating like crazy! It's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is. Are you nuts? They'll fry us for sure. There's no way we're doin' that, you understand? No way. No we didn't. He died on his own. Well, we didn't know that at the time. I don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?! We're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway... I don't know... Fair enough, I'll take it to my place. Well we didn't kill him, he died on his own. I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out -- Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene. You know what they'd do. Okay then. I'll do it. Well neither have I, but it's us or him. If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in. Besides, he's a low life scumbag. His kind is hardly even human anyway. I don't know... I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail. We can't risk it. How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me! I don't know! Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you? What are you gonna do? Well, we won't do any of that shit! What's that? We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else. Car went up in the gunfight. We'll torch the bases, how's that? All right we will. Maybe. Who cares? They killed themselves. Besides, they were breaking the law. What they were doing was wrong! Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles? That's right! It's no accident we stumbled on this money. It's an answer to a prayer! Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push. Tonight my prayer came true. Because...I know. I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen! Who's going to question us? Dwayne? Jesse? We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus! We'll figure something out. Why? Hell, it won't be us! Come on Booth! Look at these scumbags around us. Who's going to know what happened! Let's take it and get out of here! Robbed a bank, c'mon! Don't you think we would have heard if one, two -- shit I don't know how many were at large! Don't you think there would be a bulletin? This is a big ass drug deal! Look around you partner! You said yourself you never saw anything like it. Why? Are you kidding me? I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm -- What are we going to do? There must be over a million dollars in here. They're out of towners... Arizona plates... That's what everyone thinks. But according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate. Oh, you would have done great. Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two... He would have won more but he blew it at the end. Didn't know what Cash and Carry was. Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher. He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars! Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that? His excuse was the government got it all. I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble. Thanks for the loan, man. I'll have it in a few days, I promise. How old is Otis anyhow, thirty? I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave. Ready to roll, partner? Hell, I don't know. If I had some input I'd offer it up. I don't know. What makes you say that? Why? Don't worry the real men are in charge now. Easy to purchase, hard to detect. Too much potassium can kill a man. Just have to...pick a discreet spot. We gotta, Jesse. It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice. We gotta know where the tapes are. I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is. We're gonna talk. You're never getting that much. Well you can't have it. Oh Jesus Christ... What do you mean? You gambled it? Well you're not getting, either. What? We're out of here. And if we refuse? Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that? Then what the hell are you all about? Absolutely positively. You've done without it long enough, ma. Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough. Besides, I want you to have it. Yeah. Figured you could have it. Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place. And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail. Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well... There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks... Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go... Hey -- I've got a surprise. At least around here it does. Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool. It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you. But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say. Well, same ol' same ol'. Yeah. I was in the neighborhood. Hi ma.OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!! TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!! HELLLLLP!!!! You're only screwing yourselves over! Helllllp! HELLLLLP! SOMEBODY!!! Come on, Booth. Don't let him do this!!! You better believe it if you know what's good for you! I was beginning to think you weren't going to show. That can't be all of it. I'm not gonna take -- I'm not gonna take it in stride. I had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out. Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem. I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat! I want my share. All of it. There's going to have to be a change in our arrangement. By Friday. I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you? Ok...I'll wait. For now. But I'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak. Well, I don't know... I'm all ears. Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80. You can buy 'em at any store. There's no way they can pin anything on me. My offer? Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends. All I want is my share, which I guess is... Listen Earl. I covered for you. For both of you. I put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me! My point, well... You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies. Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all. No. Something wrong with you Dwayne? Well I'm here now. Yeah...see you at three. I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time. Uh, sure. I hear you. About what? Why? I'm at a payphone in Vegas. What's up? Yeah whaddya want?. Yeah. That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws. Sort of. Aw, now that�s gonna take time to clear! No. But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I�m a busy man. Very clumsy, very clumsy. I�d have found it in a minute. Damn it�s hot in here... I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won�t immediately look. Stop! Stop! I don't need the money. You can have it all. Don't hurt me. Well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off! What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches -- I think I am. You want to see how more unglued I can get? Try me. So I want the money and I want it now. I was on a roll! I�m a little overextended now. Listen - I'm not asking. Just do it! Meet me there, now. Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner. Right behind you. True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl? I'll settle for a third of that. Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.OK. Say what it is. Hey, that's whacked! I thought we was gettin' on here! That's cool. We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter. That's some serious poundage in dollars. Fifty million! Are we talkin' United States dollars? Lee! It's him! You know what a phone booth is?! Do I look like I'm movin'?! What you're seeing here? This is not movement. This is my "still". And that, of course, would be me. Feds asked for me? Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass. Well...you know what I mean. I know, but -- Sir, I can explain. So was I. Tell me about it. I'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch! Your ass is goin' to jail! He stole my wheel! Ooo, there's a chill. Love that. No shark fin, no camel hump. What you listenin' to? FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo. Like I'm supposed to drop everything. You know him? Hey, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to it. What? Well, I ain't goin' to China. And neither are you. I'm sorry, Lee. You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.? No, wait. I don't have it. You have it. It ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up. Take the damn gun. Like that. No, like a tourist. You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit. OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town. This concrete? This is still America. Which one? What?! Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type. No, fish is a PM food. I got to stop that dancing in the street �till all hours. No! You hate me. Look, I'm gonna do it one time. That's it. Not yee-aw, Ya'll. And it's gotta be angry. Like you're pissed off. No, no. It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll. Ya'll! That's not how it goes. You know War? Now, that's American music. No, no. I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas. �scuse me. Yeah, it's good. Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like? Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere. Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant. It happens. You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space. Let's go. Everybody take off? Come on! Yeah, somethin' like that. OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand? OK, let's go. What? When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear? This is my man, you dig? My informant. You know what an informant is? Alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'? Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man. Nobody's from here. My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama. So where the hell am I from? Kenya? Hey, stop. We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed. Don't go there... What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb? Bullshit! You were trying' to lose my ass again. Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what? Six hours? It was my ass that almost got trashed! What the hell kinda cop are you?! The license! You get it?! You make the plate? You don't know what a shortcut is? I know a shortcut. Let me just clarify a few things. I don't care what kind of cop you are in China, you have no jurisdiction in America. Without me you are just another tourist. Right.... You're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you? Bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole. Oh yeah, but this is on the way. And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet! Wait. You hungry? You gotta be hungry, you just flew in from China. And what'd they feed you, Chinese food, right? Then you gotta be hungry. Hell, it doesn't matter, I'm hungry. We'll get some food on the way to the Consulate. Where were we? Well don't do that. Polite don't work here. You do that polite shit here in America, they'll sue your ass for harassment. That silly-ass look on your face. -- what the hell is that? Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay? We're gonna be in some deep shit here. Working the danger zone. And you need insurance. Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit. Yeah, that's right. Now that we understand each other... show me how you did that. Okay, fine, you're full a shit, I'm full a shit. You're full of shit. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit? It's the same thing! Bullshit a little. You lied to me. You speak English! Yeah, well you're in American now. Everybody's got guns. That tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell. You have one of these? Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass. You're shittin' me. You know the Beach Boys?! Okay, I'll slow down. So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name? How old are you? You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that. Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat. Not to me. Never to me. Yeah. So why you look do down? You OK? It's okay. For restaurants. That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl! What?! This is a class ride, Johnson. It's called you're gonna kill me. What're you doin' with that on? Oh my god...what happened to you? Alright, Johnson, thank you. So...what are you wearing? This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that? Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something. Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust. No way in the way! I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby. Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it. In Charge. Just me'n him. No interference. They don't even want to hear from us until we're done. I love the F.B.I. I love the F.B.I. Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of. They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type. He is like the baddest Asian shield they got. And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him. Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team. How'd what go? I wouldn't be close to you. What is that perfume, girl? I could get promoted right out of here. Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is? FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it. Hey, baby, it's cool. Captain just reassigned me to the Feds. Hey, I was senior. It's OK. This is why I get the big bucks. Oh, baby, you cruel... You're killin' me here. Not anymore. Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color? What?! Okay, let me start from the top. A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night... No, sir. I'm as good as it gets. Oh yeah. The caller was a man. Confident. Had an accent. My guess, Asian. Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir? Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is. He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity. Hmmmm? Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert! Yo, Johnson... You understand what I'm sayin'? Try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of Chinese -- What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo? Why don't you assign one of your own men to this? What kind of assignment is that? I'm talking about the girl. Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation... Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte. How much they want? Any demands yet? Where do we find him? I'm waitin' here for a name. All I gotta do is implicate. The Feds can do a lot with a good implication. Even if you don't get Sparky, I'll bet you get ten to twenty more. Plenty of time to find a nice fella. You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know... ...this is your MO. You got a boy friend in here yet? �Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye. Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk. I will leave him on this side. Then we trade places. You get him, I get her. Get the picture, Lois? What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package? You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande... With two shots of non-fat milk. Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you. That does nothin' for me. No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop? I oughta pat your ass down. Make sure you're not a cop. This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment. Make him think you don't trust him. You a cop or something? Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...Oh, I think you like this very much. It's Hong Kong, not Tokyo. My country asked for the best. I told them that was you. Now I will show you around my �hood. What a surprise! Oh my god. Griffin. No, it is China, my country, my history. If any of it gets damaged... The art. Oh no. What are you doing here? Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now. I'm sorry. Oh no, I dropped it. Oh yes. No, please, I don't -- I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women. I am from outa town. What do you hear? This is my territory now. You are my responsibility. Going into the restaurant. It's him. Excuse me? Want some? Are you OK? Good God, ya'll! Yee-aww. Yes, I think so. Who does not know War? �War, hhh, Wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing. Good-God, you all.� Yes, I know this song. You want more? That one is my favorite. Chicken puff with shark fin. You like it? Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses. That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph. Thank you. I learn a great deal. Took off. Yes. They took off. You talk too fast. Stool pigeon. Stooly. Yes. He was part of the Juntao crime family. He may be Juntao himself. And he dropped this. I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America. I could not come. I had other responsibilities. I worked with Ambassador Han and his family for ten years. He wanted me to come with them to America. If I had, this might not have happened. No. I just made it up. When a man steps in dung, it is obvious. There is no need to rub it in his face. The smell is the same. It was a man I was after in Hong Kong. He was trying to kill me, not you. Did you make the plate?! No. What plate? Shortcut? What about them? Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here. It was not my intent -- I thought you were taking me to the consulate. Witnesses. I was being polite. What? I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information. We are both full of shit. Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking. You seemed as if you liked to talk. I like to let people talk who like to talk. It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are. I am not responsible for your assumptions. I didn't say I didn't. You assumed I didn't. A little. No. Help me Rhonda. Beach Boy America. Help me Rhonda, help me get her out of my -- Beach Boy. You talk very fast. Soon Young, don't worry. You will have many friends very soon. You will see. America is a very friendly place. I was trying to find the right time. I still have work to do here.And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China. Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you. I'm not interested, Carter. You're no longer on this assignment. Why don't you try the assignment. Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it? Don't play bullshit games with me. That's what you were supposed to be! You think this is funny, Carter? You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there! Carter, shut up! What do you mean you lost him?! How could you lose him?! Just make him think you're following leads. Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit. I don't care. I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved. Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we? His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late. Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job. Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident. Don't worry about the kidnapping, Carter, the F.B.I. will handle that. Your assignment is Lee. He is the situation. ... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances. His name is Lee. And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason. You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent. At this point we don't have much. Don't worry, he's with Carter. Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7. As soon as they pick up the money, we've got �em. Carter, can I have a moment? I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States... As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need. Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.Shit, that was no big deal. Forty-two-hundred, I figure. Not where I come from. Yep. Thirty-ought-six, Norton long-barrel with dual-groove, parallel rifling, elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer. We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County. I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry. I don't make jokes about things of, or related to, the preaching of the Holy Gospel, including the ministerial calling of my family. In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer. I'm Jackson. I'm from West Fork, Tennessee. My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel. Figured. You writin' a book or somethin'? I am, but I like imported whiskey. So there I am and I hear the biggest ole' coon you ever did hear, 'a rustlin' right there in front of me. That ole' boy comes right out of the brush, I got a clear shot and he knows he's 'bout to meet his maker. I aim, I got my finger tight on the trigger and then I just smile and say to that ole' coon, go on, now, you get out 'a here. Then I sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a' that mash whiskey. Me? I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon. I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey... No kiddin'? Like hell, you did. He ain't Wade. He ain't half-bad, I guess. I think I'm we got that eighty-eight. Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk? Yes, sir. Cap'n...? So, that's Ryan. Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live. Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade. Shut up, will you? Last I knew. Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee. Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft. Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister. You got somethin' against the Cap'n? Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off. To each, his own. Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n? Say what, Cap'n? Not yet. Sir, I understand. I don't like it, but I understand. Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner. Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade. Watching. We left them eighty-eights. In the shadow by those two trees. Yes, sir. It seems to me, sir, that the entire resources of the United States Army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only, and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop, smack-dab in the middle of Berlin, Germany. Now I ain't one to question decisions made up on high, sir, but it seems to me that saving one private, no matter how grievous the losses of his family, is a waste of my God-given talent. Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources. Miller Go on. Sir, I have an opinion on this matter. I most likely would have, sir, had I been given the opportunity. Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable. If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.Thank you, sir. The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away. One private is simply not worth a squad. Colonel anderson This one is. He's worth a lot more than that. Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is. Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense. Sir. But, sir...I...I... A private, sir? Sir? Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns. Yes, sir. They didn't want to give up those one-fifty-fives, sir. Fourty-four, twenty one dead. A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence. Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc. Find a chaplain. It's worth it. You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley. It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field. The garage windows face left field. The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them. The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens. Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows. It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far. I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship. I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all. I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass. Keep trying. Good, now get your goddamned gear. You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve. There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand? Who's Wade? What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson? Gives Wade the second shot. They don't send planes to put out machine guns. Two flank runners with surpressing fire. I'm going right, whoever goes left has to be fast. My guess, too. Where? Wade? Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson. This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue. I'd love to hear it. You didn't volunteer, Jackson. No, three brothers of his were killed in action. Command wants him out of there. A paratrooper named Ryan. He's going home, if he's alive. How about that jeep? A half-track, anything. White-walls? I changed my mind. I teach English at Addley High School in Addley, Pennsylvania. That's better, but you've still got a long way to go. Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers. There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay. Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping. You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice. Sure, you got one? Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades. Those guns are close. You don't count. Same place we are. Plenty. What do they know? I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out. Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud. I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here. Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives. A machine gun. Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss. Did he see any sign of them? I don't expect to live that long. I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money. Some. It seemed appropriate. I've been humming it. It looks like a Renoir. You think the rest of us were? Sarge? Upham? Like I said, it was nothing. Don't bunch up. It was nothing. DASHES across the street. Glad of it. That's not all. There were nine gunners on the eighty-eights, one had a broken heel on his boot, two had bratwurst for supper last night, one of them is named Fritz, the other, Hans, maybe, I don't know, it's hard to tell. FORWARD! FORWARD! NOW REVERSE! Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you. Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive. Out of the mouth of babes. We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else. Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks. Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable. But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted. Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me. Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore. You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive. No, but if I get any worse, you'll have to relieve me. I think you're right, Keith. That's the rub. I liked Wade. Who's Ryan? If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose? Look at my hand, there it goes again. Simple, numbers. Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs? I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns. That's over three hundred men. Maybe five hundred. A thousand. Then thousand. Any number you want. See? It's simple. It lets you always choose mission over men. Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn. So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men? Of course not. You bluff, you lie. It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men. No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier. Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking? She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt. Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost. She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands. And he bluffs? He had sixteen levels of bullshit. Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master. She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it. That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him. You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her? Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze? What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off? Let's just find someplace. Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot. He's done this before. More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on... SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein. Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain. Motions impatiently to Sarge. About to pour his sulfa. Sees the wound. Stops. Knows it's fatal. Rolls to his feet. FIRE another BURST. KILLS the last of the German riflemen. Doesn't pause. RUNS onto the field. How about you shut up and take your position? How about you take your position? Yeah? What rule of thumb is that? I'll be alright. No. It comes and goes. It stops when I look at it. A couple of weeks. It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading. It doesn't take this. Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission. You never know. If we stayed, we could make a difference. Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender. They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up. They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright. Nope. Since when have things been normal? Maybe. Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders. Let's go. That's not what we're here for. PUSH! Yep, hell of a mission. A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on. Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts. Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead. Somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the Hundred-and-First's radios the night before the drop, not one of them works. We're going in blind. Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay. We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot. I've got a line on one. What about Talbot? Okay, Wade. Translators? I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition. Simpson. Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home. I wish. You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission. Don't need to, the Krauts go that covered. Worked, didn't it? I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER. GO! Goddamn it! Knows what that means. He hears the RUMBLE OF THE TANKS. FIRES a burst. More Germans drop. Here they come. Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK. Barely has time to react. Sees: I wonder if his cabin is still available? I coach the baseball team, too. Get back to your positions! HERE THEY COME! Cocks his Thompson. Settles down behind some sandbags. See to it. Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here. You're goddamned right, I give the order. Vote! Jesus Christ! Listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, I am the ranking officer here and what I say goes, is that clear? You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules. I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. HERE WE COME. Cover me. ON THE BRIDGE! WE'RE COMING IN. Scans the Germans with his binoculars. That's a mystery to me. Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material? But we accomplish the mission. I don't like that one. Except for the last part, that one's not bad. Why's that? Well now I'm saying we're moving out. Get off your ass. Up. We're moving out. Is silent. Motionless. He gently closes Wade's eyes. His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags. He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices. We can't leave it here. I'll make a note of your suggestions but I'll leave that last one to you, especially if he's already dead. Any further thoughts on the subject? But I am a captain. If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in... In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering. The men thoroughly enjoy the performance. Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command. Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down. You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers. Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you. How long you been in the army? You have orders, too. Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all. Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine. Ours is not to reason why. Sure, what do you want to know? Upham, are you sure you've never been in combat? Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance. Well, I, for one, like cheese. There's always a bright side. There's to be a bright side, look for it. Yeah, how so? Sure, Reiben. Trust me, you're the best. Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best. Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles. He sees his men and walks toward them. Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading. Stay at it until you get fire control. Keep 'em down, wait for the navy. There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen. Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie? Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen. Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork. Sarge? He was the best friend I ever had. Lemme tell you about Sarge... Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson. Upham? Good kid, smart, he was writing a book. Yes, Private. Races through the debris. Trailed by BULLETS. Doesn't move. He just stares at Sarge's body. Struggling with a pair of Germans. You set? Sarge nods. Don't do that again. No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid. Alright, come with me. Yeah, yeah. I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand? The hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if I have to drag you every inch of the way. You hear me, Private? This bridge cannot be held. The Germans have two companies less than three miles from here. They have tanks. Private. I'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee. What deal? Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it. Nope, he ain't Wade. I guess. I mean, Ryan, what do you think of him? What do you think? Hell, no! Y'all come back. Of course, sir. He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is. Looks like a flaming asshole to me. You know what the best possible thing that could happen is? The hell he didn't. You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of. Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard. Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch. Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother. They got squirrels there, too, right? You know what a B.A.R. weighs? Nineteen and a half pounds, not counting ammo. And you think these things are comfortable? They may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each, that's thirty-six pounds, right there. If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me. Hell, no. I think he's the best officer in the whole goddamned army, bar none. No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian. They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s. I know this for a fact. Jackson? More tanks... Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation. They know that they are dead men. They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die. Continues FIRING. CUTTING DOWN the advancing Germans. FIRES a burst. Germans drops. That's not where I am. Miller No? Where are you? What deal? Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN. Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us. Maybe Caen. Yes, sir, of course, sir, I was merely speaking hypothetically. IF this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. But of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir. Have it your way, Captain. What if our guys open up, sir? Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain. Looks like tea time, maybe they're Brits. No, sir. Maybe. But what if he dies on the way back? you see what I'm saying, sir? The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division. Neither do I, sir. C: And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded. Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him. B: Ryan is dead. He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention. There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea. We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another. Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A: Ryan is alive. We have to take him back to the beach. Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive. I've given this a lot of thought, sir. The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead. I thought you said we had an hour, sir? Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around. Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan. Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar. I'm sorry, sir, I apologize. But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say? Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers. Easy for you to say, sir. Fucking James Ryan, I'd like to wring his fucking neck. I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir. It's a personal thing. Huh? Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one? What's the sense in risking six guys to save one? Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me? Jesus Christ, he's a natural! General Gavin is going to be very irritated at you, Captain. I'm listening, sir. Sir, you know what Ramelle is famous for? Cheese. The rest of the company is going to Caen and we're going to the goddamned cheese capital of France. There is no bright side. I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf. Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off? And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead. Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me. Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir? Captain, can I ask you a question? But, sir... No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest. Or what about Faulkner? Or that little guy with the glasses? Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir... I don't think so, Captain. Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies. Miller Dream on, private. Lingerie is my life, sir. My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion. Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night? So, you ever heard of employee discounts? My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen. Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here? Captain, can I put in for a transfer? ...for you to blow up, yeah, yeah, we heard that. Wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, I can't explain it, but I've seen it. You want unpleasant? Just wait, I can do much better than this. Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear. Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again. That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot. Hey, I got a mother. Jackson, you got a mother? Captain, he's fast! I usually like surprises. Lingerie. I care. Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge? Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine. Shit, sir. What about you, Captain? Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it... On guard, glancing back. Pissed off. He's fast, Captain, I saw him. We know. Get lost.Yes, sir. Uh, oh. What are we going to do? What do you think? Yes, sir. You're welcome, John. I'll do my best. I know. Just what I want to do. You want me to take over? John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up. Except this time, the mission IS a man. And how do you bluff yourself? Oh, yeah? And what about your own hand? Bits and pieces. Yeah. Vecchio. You alright? Hesitates. Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack. Finds the morphine. Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder. HOLD YOUR FIRE! How about...? How about I go right, sir? You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore. Is it getting worse? Makes you feel small, doesn't it? Yup, hell of a mission. I hope this boy Ryan is worth it. You're kidding yourself. Three for three. Nope. And what about you? You think they'll be alright? Good news? You got me. Afraid of bad news? It's not normal, not reading letters from home. You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps. He's right, Captain, it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys. Got it, sir. We gonna go take care of those eighty-eights? Uh, Captain... Uh, Captain... Hell of a mission. We in radio contact with anybody up there? You get a translator, Captain? Twenty minutes ago. Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one. You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport. Fresh out. Beasley's dead. Simpson? Jesus Christ on a fucking pogo stick! What about the company? You? Leading a squad? Caen? You tryin' to get yourself killed? CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET! Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap. The other five right behind. Jesus, Reiben, think of the poor bastard's mother. Damn fool. Sir. What are we likely to run into? Yeah? So? Frogs? Who cares? Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.Did you see what he did, back there? He stepped right into the open, so I could get across. You take account of the wind? That must be four thousand yards. You must be a hell a shot. The Army gave you that? What about the Captain? Where's he from? So they travel around from place to place and preach? No kidding. In West Fork? As a matter of fact, I am. So, where are you from? Captain, what about our deal? What'd you say, Captain? Goddamn it, sir... But, sir... The Germans do. Would they notice and eighty-eight? What about our grenades? I can tell what the gunners had for dinner. I'd like to stay, too, Captain. I wonder where they're going. That only leaves three. The men said, nine. Good luck, Captain. What is it? No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer. Five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg. The leg got infected. Last night he went to Ville Cholet to get a doctor. The doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found. The Krauts must have shown up while he was gone. If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand. Over three-hundred. Where are you from, Captain? You know classical music? I heard. Yes. Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy? I wasn't made for this. Pass. But you could have gotten killed and I... Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I... On the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with Jackson. Upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what Miller just did for him. You can tell all that, just by the sound, sire? I know about bracketing. I read about it. The next one is going to land right on us. I don't know, I kind of like Wade's idea about the cruise ship. I've never been to Tahiti. Freaked out. Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter. Can't. Sir, I ran the 220 in high school. Somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living. But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men. So, where are you from? Twenty-four-five. You think he really believed it? How do you do it? Demolition, right?That's me. By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary! Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful. Who is that? Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so. Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary! Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business But nothing is happening. Is it going well? Where is the play? How? So what do we do? by order of the Master of the Revels! The theatres are all closed by the plague! This time we take your boots off! Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter�Almost finished? Of course not! A share of the profits. Good title. What's the title? Partners! And his ears. Cut his nose off. Put his feet in. Take his feet out. Where will you get When?See you in jail. We have no Juliet! And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you? Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket. Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles. The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end? I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business Yes, but very well. Very well. Oh, it's coming, it's coming. I don't know. It's a mystery. Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well. Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre. Oh, that. What have I done, Mr. Fennyman? Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment. Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something. There's never any But I have to pay the actors and the authors. Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant. And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman! A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare! It's a comedy. I have a wonderful new play! Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake. Do you know it? Who are you? it will be all right, madam. It is over. Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this! I don't know. It's a mystery. Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right. The show must � you know Another little problem. I don't know, it's a mystery. No, it will turn out well. By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife! Juliet? You mean Ethel. The one who came with your letter? What? Who? It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it. Nobody. The author. We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster. Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages? My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo? Will! Have you finished? Rosaline? You mean Ethel. Is it about a pirate's daughter? Now where? Will? Where are you going? Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs! Fifty pounds? What for? Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since. No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel? Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful - Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet? Who is she this time?! God be praised! Locked? No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play? Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse. I will. Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?! Not ready? Where is she? It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master. Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance! Two hours at prayer! Fifty shillings. Pounds. Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end? Your Majesty! Your Majesty I like her. Is she obedient? My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile? Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing. And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house. I understand of course. It is to be expected. Bless me, I thought it was a horse. You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding. Lady Viola is�young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune. Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you! She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief. Will you defy your father and your Queen? It was your eyes. No, your lips. Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . . How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia. Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure. No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command. I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege. My lady VIOLA. I have spoken with your father. My lady Viola. By God, I'll fight the lot of you You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell! That dog! An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house? There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house? Is there a man? On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps Are you bringing your laundry woman? By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name? "Poet?"Oh�what have I done? You are a gentleman. Thank you, Ned. Ah Oh Ned�I know�I know You did not like the speech? Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write. Mercutio We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona Lady? Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box. Do you know that house? Really? Yes. Follow that boat! Done. I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men. Ten pounds. It's for Henslowe. He paid me. Romeo Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover. A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful. When I have fifty pounds. I am still owed money for this play, Burbage. Will it restore my gift? yet cannot love nor write it. Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing. On my mother's side the Ardens She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so A goodly length in times past, but lately It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring. Nothing comes. I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed. Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift. Words, words, words�once, I had the gift�I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones�for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery�but now And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead. I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary. Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role. Yes, I saw it. Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome. How will it? Go on. What do we do now? How will it? We are lost. By God, I wish I knew. God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life? What? Romeo. Cut round him for now. You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go We are about to embark on a great voyage. We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster. Tomorrow I did not. Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part. Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good! I feel a scene coming on. To the Palace at Whitehall. To my weekly confession. No, then. Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over. Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds? Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona. Who wrote that? What piece? Richard Crookback? Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate? She is always Aphrodite. As soon as I have found my muse It is all locked safe in here Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move This is a different one. Good luck with yours, Kit. Mercutio�good name. The daughter of his enemy. Do you think? Yes, that's good. Until he meets Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word. Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know. Good title. I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?" I hear you have a new play for the Curtain. I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business. I have. And chinks to show for it. Wonderful, wonderful. Kit I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare. Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE? I have lost my gift. Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line. Luck be with you, Sam. Sam�? Master Henslowe, you have your actors. But your voice Have they dropped? Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again? But the plague You have opened the playhouses? So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men. I have to get back. Oh. What is your name? You admire it? Better fortune, boy. I'll be damned if you are! Who are you, master? Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye. You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die. How does it? and thus unable to declare her love Orsino�good name Sold in marriage and half way to America. A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love? I have hurt you and I am sorry for it. I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us. "�thou need'st not to be gone." "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale." No�no. You cannot marry Wessex! Oh, my love You ran from me before. I was the more deceived. My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed. He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come. Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations. A literary feud. Quite normal. I know how to fight! Then I will go with you. To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day. You cannot! Not for the Queen herself! In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature. I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies. Oh, but it is mine too! "Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?" Yes, some of it is speakable. I must. I must It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl. There is time. It is still dark. Let him be damned for his pages! Oh, let Henslowe wait. No, the morning rooster woke me. I must. Look-- how pale the window. Well perhaps better than my first. Oh There is. It is strange to me, too. I am. Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent. Can you love a fool? You can bring them with a word. Oh my lady, my love! Oh--I am him too! A lowly player. The same, alas. Will Shakespeare! My lady! It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink. For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes! Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden! Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples! Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom? Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song. Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy! Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself. Like a sickness and its cure together. Your aunt? No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this? She loves me, Thomas! And break her heart and mine? She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do? Of course you have not! I have not written it! He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet? Do you understand me? Let me see you. Take off your hat. Wait there. Where did you learn how to do that? Take off your hat. Your name? You are on my ground. Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry. A theatre poet? A man, my lord? Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches! Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina! Here we come at last, my lord! Christopher Marlowe at your service. How do I offend, my lord? I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.Dr. Levine, please! Return to your seat! ... Your civil rights have been overridden! Please, Dr. Levine. Calm down, Dr. Levine. Fletcher! Now! Get out of there! Fletcher, get away from there... Fletcher, I want you back here. Fletcher? What are you doing out there? Pull it, damn it! Now! Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have. This thing is gonna crush us. Do you see it? It's either that or we grow gills. Increase positive pressure! He's right beneath us. Why can't I -- ? What the hell is going on here? Thirty yards. Sure. Each time it started fires inside the habitat. Forty yards. It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface. But we've never used it underwater before. We're a habitat. Not a castle. The only defense we have is High Voltage. Fifty yards and closing. A squid? The size of a whale? I don't think so. Target acquired. Sixty yards. Direction's east coming! Shut up, Beth. I don't want to hear it. You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you? Can't you tell us something. Nobody move! Nobody move. There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed. My procedures. And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely. Back at the door -- I asked you to back away. They told me about sixty hours. The surface ships will be back. After the storm clears. Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman? What are you -- his mother? Get Norman, I want everyone ready to go. Edmunds, the subs? Yeasts? Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread. Alright, Beth, do that thing you did before. What is it? I said back away. Back away then. Basic English? There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet. Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet. Pull it. You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner? Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions. What the hell? It shut us down. Going active. No. I think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat. He might be listening now. Bullshit. What's out there isn't alien. It's an animal. You think he killed Edmunds? I don't want you talking to Jerry. If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. Edmunds? Can you copy? Damn it, Edmunds? Edmunds? You don't think weapons are important? Great, okay. Ask him about his weapons. What am I -- a dog, now? He translated it wrong. "My name is Jerry"? It's like "See Spot run." -- without a cautionary word to anyone. You know, Ted said something to me earlier. I think he's right. He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy." -- and then brought her down here -- You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation -- So you knew this when you wrote your report? When was this? She should've known better. I think I do. How drastic? No "buts". If he wants to be left, we'll leave him. Hello? Yes, the subs -- I want a report... Hello... Yes, a report. Gimme... shit. I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say. He's here somewhere. Find him. The sub's on it's way. Go! C'mon! What do you mean, he's missing? Just worry about yourself. Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes. Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant. Don't get hysterical, Norman. Everything can be killed. You mean, what's in that thing is immortal? Like "Thou shall not kill"? What? I don't know. But it's something alien. What is it, Norman? It's a corrosive gas. On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile. At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic. Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile. They pressurize us with helium. Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson. We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail. The one you recommended. In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration. We think it might. That's why we brought you here. We've assembled your team -- they're waiting for us now. Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me. I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor. Extraordinary, isn't it? Maybe older -- -- dating the crash at least that old. Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year -- See this? Coral. Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick. As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago. Something like that. That doesn't surprise you? What? Survivors? No, I wouldn't think so. A thousand feet. A cyclone's on it's way in. I thought they would have told you on the phone. We're moving fast considering the storm. Well, we don't have all the facts yet. Good. Security's been our biggest worry. Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight. You talk to any reporters? Any press? Anything else? What have you been told so far? Come with me. The team's already waiting. Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson. You weren't my choice. The Pentagon made me take you. Captain. Edmunds, get in here. I need you for this. Norman, get out of there now! Norman? They've left, keep watching! Well, where the fuck is he? What the hell is going on here? Fuck him. What? Hello? Any sign of Harry? They're coming. Send them, damn it! I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible -- Get him out of there. I thought I told you people -- What caused it? Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- Thank you, I can see that. Try something else. Can you open that panel? She wired this system. Edmunds? Get in here. I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted. With an "o". Harold with an "o". I'm in charge. What? Not now, Beth. Please. I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking. Where's Edmunds? Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing. Ignorant. The thing's ignorant. How do you mean, strange? What's the message? We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it? Who is that? Where's that coming from? Gimme a report, I want -- Just tell me worst case. Worst case of what we might find? You don't know that. Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind. So? What's the problem? The what? So how do we get it open? A break for what? What? So do we. And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. Yes, Harry. I did. I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. It's chipped. I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts. The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb. The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented. To the craft? None. Not a scratch. In the dome hanger. All our tapes are transferred to the sub. It's on a 12 hour timer. If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes. Resetting the sub. Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood? It won't register. It's too big to image. The sensors are picking up something outside. Edmunds? It's not talking, it's mimicking. I am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named Jerry. I want a name. A real name. This thing's full name, rank and serial number. From the sphere? Get out of there. I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood? Internal power. They switched us over. We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside! How can he be missing? Ted, shut up. Are you packed? Ready to go? I want everyone packed. Now! What? No, I know they're civilians... But what does it do? This... sphere. What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? We had considered it. What do you make of this? Radiation shield, you think? What is it? Ted, get her away from the door. What about a crowbar? Duly noted, Ted. Edmunds, try using suction. Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside. The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic. She's not gonna know. What -- you want me to retype it? He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge. She's not gonna know, sir. He understands me fine. It's not ignorant. I have to tell you. It's strange. ... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message. It's a single sequence repeated over and over. Please watch your closest monitor... Ladies and Gentlemen... Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe. Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set. There wouldn't be any place to plug it in. It could. But the odds of it being any use to us are against it. It's nonsense. There's enough difference between our own species to prove that. Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows. The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman. Ted seems to have some ideas. To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere. No. They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all. They have another purpose entirely. We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. Ted? Captain? Then how can it be chipped? I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? Chipped? The door? How can it be chipped? Right. So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch? How much damage? Won't make any difference. The tapes document everything. They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them. Yes you are... You're staring at me. Why are you looking at me like that? Another attack? Just in time for what? In time for what? Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion. That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth. We never even had a conversation, Norman. I never said that. Cannibalism, to be extreme. And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible. A light switch. A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. It's an American spacecraft. You'd have to ask them. For who? The fish? Pry the thing open? What are we -- neanderthals? You mean forget? We all kill ourselves? Bad joke. Sorry, Beth. No. I don't. But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing. How's that working out, by the way? It's not fast enough, Norman. There's a helluva lot of explosive down there. Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it. Well, press something! You know how to work this thing? I'm trying. There. Her legs are in the way. Gimme a second -- C'mon, Norman! Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three -- Hurry, Norman. Four minutes. Missed. Push her, c'mon. I can't reach her. How far away's the sub? How much time you figure to get to the surface? We're never gonna make it. Fine. I could hit her a little harder. More toward the cranium. Did I kill her? Stop what? What are you -- ? What is it? Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag? The three of us. Don't have to. Watch. It'll do it for you. Navy transmission. They're sent from Wisconsin. Wisconsin's your answer. She's lying, Norman. Just like she lied about fixing your suit. I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there. Take a look for yourself. She's cracking, Norman. I thought she was with you. Her suit's gone. When I woke up, nobody was here. What happened to her? You're clear. You see the airlock? Norman, where are you? ... you there? Norman? I don't remember much. It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it. Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer. Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman. You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others. It's normal, really, isn't it? In a crisis. The stress. The panic. Did I? Don't do this. Don't psychoanalyze me. I hate squid. Period. Just like you hate jellyfish. There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute. What are they? I could never read that far. I never wanted to. What happens on page 87? Have you ever read page 87? Norman? You don't understand about the sphere. You were all supposed to leave. You weren't supposed to stay down here. What are you still doing here? It's like... What is that? That noise? Curious, isn't it? What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see. Then what, Norman? You mean, you think I'm cracking? Am I? Gimme another explanation. Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. So, we know . We know it went through a black hole. We saw it. Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we? It'd go in some report like some big discovery. So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. But they didn't . The called it an Unknown Entry Event. On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was. Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible. A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible. I'm completely serious. There is something very important missing from that spacecraft. You know what that is? And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures. What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional? So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it. Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human. If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding. Our present. This spacecraft was designed to pick things up. They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in. They come across this. This... sphere . Find it interesting, curious. They draw it inside to take back home. This answers one of our questions. Time travel. A black hole. Our answer. Nice work, Norman. C'mon, Norman. C'mon. Go ahead. Ladies first. You sound defensive. Don't be defensive. You holding up alright? How are you feeling, Norman? It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer. He'd run screaming "witchcraft". And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics. Good idea, Ted. "We are friends". Codes are for hiding information. So it's making a mistake. It's making a code without intending to. I figured it's probably substituting numbers for letters... Then I began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard. And since we're getting spirals, I imagined the keyboard as a spiral. So I translated it... ... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code? If you're trying to communicate, why use a code? If it is a message, it's probably a substitution code. I'll work on it. Well, if it's a discharge -- Salt's good for you, Ted. Helps you from getting impotent. Look closely. That isn't writing. Those are grooves. Not where. When. 400 years ago. From our future. It didn't fly here. It arrived here. Meaning it didn't land in the water. We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal. Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper. But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere. Not even a scratch. It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain? That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it? Save your breath. It's not an alien spacecraft. Do you? All the facts you need are right in front of you. Think about it. Is it? A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it? Someone went to a lot of trouble. Try again. You don't think it does? I think it's rather obvious. That's right. Shutup, Ted. You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. Easy Ted, we're not mining gold. You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman? Just one of Norman's many secrets. She told me what you said, Norman. Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down. Thinks it's a mistake. To who? Arthur? Nothing. Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.I see it. Yes, sir. I'm here. Jerry? Please. Stop this. Jerry? Maybe so. But I think we need to ask Jerry about it. Yes, I do. Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier. But sir, I think it's imperative. I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related. At least our obituaries will be accurate. That's reassuring. What for? ... it raises a very serious question: What happens if Jerry gets mad ? Because if Jerry is powerful and also emotional... I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. That's smart. Let's talk about guns and violence. The message doesn't show a lack of intelligence. It's smart. It's approaching us in a simple way. Like you would a dog. Holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you. -- I didn't know it would come to this -- Wait a second -- At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break. '81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know. She put a razor to her wrists a day later. A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement. You don't want to know. I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic. But sir -- You can't just leave Harry down here, sir. He's missing. He's gone. He left. Harry's missing. All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. I don't know. That's the point. Or maybe, it can't be killed. If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all. Maybe we shouldn't. Picked up something? What is it? Take a look. What's wrong with oxygen? But sir, I don't understand. This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life. ULF report? Nobody's mentioned that in years. You mean someone actually read it? What team? It doesn't make any sense. It's impossible. -- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft? There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old. Hold on -- -- Wait a second -- Geologists? Not really, no. Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret... When did it crash? What is it? A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite? What do you need me for? Then why am I here? A thousand? An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors. How deep is he? They didn't tell me anything. Storm? What storm? From what? What's with all the security? Press? No, I haven't. Nothing else. The usual. Plane crash. Survivers unknown. Routine stuff really. What team? The Pentagon? I didn't know I had friends in Washington. Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it. Captain. Right, forgive me. Thank you, Colonel. Down below, Harry said we would all have to die. Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation. But sitting here, we still know. So how is that possible? Unless we make ourselves forget. Yes. And I think we already know it will. Beth -- Hear what? What? Let's get out of here, Beth. Let's go home. C'mon -- Beth -- gimme the gun. I -- I know. You're too strong, Beth. Beth? Stop it! Then where's it coming from? Beth, stop it! Where is it coming from, Beth? Beth! Don't fuck with me, Beth. Get away from the door, Beth. It's not safe for you to be either. Don't, Beth. Please. Beth -- I promise -- Don't, Beth. It's not me, Beth. I swear. It can't be. Shut up, Beth -- Beth, the message said Harry. "My name is Harry". My name isn't Harry. That's bullshit. Yes. I never went in that sphere. You're insane. You manifested that, Beth. That's when you went in the sphere. But -- You're lying -- Beth you're losing it. C'mon. Someone did. Then why, Beth? Why go in? Why put out explosives? Why manifest the snakes? He can't manifest. Against what? Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat. Why did you go in the sphere, Beth? Did you? Are you manifesting them? Do you fear them? What are they doing down here? In the bathroom? Suddenly appearing. You know what I mean. How do you feel about snakes? You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink. You think I'd really drink that? I'm feeling better. Your watch. The grooves around the door -- they've shifted. And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now. The sphere looks different. Where are you? Not believing you. I'm sorry. Thirty years ago. In residency. I passed out. You? You want to kill him? Beth -- Doesn't say. What? Wait -- isn't that dangerous? Three to six hours. "20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... " It's like a sleeping pill? What's that? P-a-r-a-s-o... Parasolutrine? Damn it! Chloramphenicol? Riordan? Bingo. Tarazine? Does it cause drowsiness? That's all we need. To get him unconscious -- put him under. Sintag. Valdomet. Ephedrine hydrochloride. Diphenyl parlene. Looks like some sort of code. Must be. And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. No. I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences. You ever read the Bible? It talks about our sinful nature, you know? I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled. It's evil. It's inside us. It's what we are. He must not realize he is. Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then. He must've manifested his dream. It's his fear. The squid. He's manifesting his fears. Making them real. I don't know, Beth. I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can. When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87. How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to. Then you found the book, remember in your lab. Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... I don't know. He acquired some sort of power. A power to manifest things. When did the messages start? The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name? But Harry never would? He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry. We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. He translated it wrong. Created. Brought to life. I don't know. But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry". And -- After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion. But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. "... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long. That would make a formidable monster." "Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... Page 87. "I could never read that far." Page 87. I don't know, Beth. I wasn't there. This being after you so carefully fixed my suit. All I know is I opened that refridgerator -- You think? Did you look? It was on the top shelf. 1-800-Deepsea delivery. I hear they're good. We must've had it delivered then. It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. The refridgerator. Fixing it. I think so, Beth. Yes. He what? Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. What are you doing in the ship? Beth? Still clear? My air isn't... I'm coming back. You fixed this suit? Beth? I can't see anything. How does it look? Still clear? But I don't know how -- You fixed my suit? I would. But my suit -- In case you die, too? Why should I go? Four days? Wake him, then. Let's go. Get outta -- You, me and Harry? It's not worth the risk. Forget the sub. Where are you going in such a hurry? Beth -- Beth, I didn't. Hold it together. Alright? Don't do this. Beth -- What? It's done, alright? It's over! And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? Calm down, Beth. Alright? You went through Edmunds' things? Where did you get this? You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- So what? C'mon, Beth. Don't make this personal. He told me himself they were taking us back. What are they? What could have done this? I can't feel her bones. She's like a sponge. Beth. Beth -- Beth. They are or they aren't. Which is it? Beth -- And you didn't tell anyone? You knew about the squid not being normal. Before Fletcher went out there? Wait a minute. What do you mean -- not normal? Me? Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived. Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here. Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid. Then jellyfish? Yeah, it was awful. ... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific. At my mother's beach house. We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him. No, thank you. I hate jellyfish. We have a library? Where'd this come from? Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think. Get this thing off me. 400 years ago? I'm sure Christopher Columbus would've loved these accomodations. No. Go ahead. Really. Ladies first. Yeah. Drowning. What -- are you threatening me? The timing has never seemed quite right. It never occurred to me. We can't go down there. We're not prepared. That deep? That takes years of training, Beth. We're just scientists. Lab scietists. We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks. Underwater? Wait -- down where? C'mon, Beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind. I spent a week reading Sagan and watching re-runs of the Twilight Zone. Seriously. I was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- I had no idea -- It's bullshit. The report's a joke. That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about? Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret? Is it coming from our own computer? Where's it coming from? When did it come across? It would erase all our knowledge of it. All of our power. The power allows us to manifest our fears, right? What if we feared the power to go away? There is one possibility. Good. Thank you. Now that I have it on. Why are you laughing? You don't even know what that means. Nine hundred feet to surface. Wait! No idea. Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit. Harry? You got her? Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! I'm trying to keep balance with -- Shut up and catch. I heard! I heard! Hold on. Are you trying, damn it? Just -- I'm trying. Shit. Here -- catch her. Hold on. Two and a half minutes. Once we're in the sub. Shut up and open the door. Help me lift her. I don't think so. It's the squid! Stop it! You know what it is, Harry. That's right. We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this. How do we decode it? Wisconsin? But why would she -- ? You didn't say that about the food? Beth left? She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. What do you mean? She's not here? Thank you. My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- I can't breathe... Am I... clear? Harry? You don't remember that? You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. Have you looked outside? Jellyfish. Everywhere. I hate jellyfish. Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? Getting anywhere with those? These aren't half bad, Fletcher. You might have a second career coming. That far in what, Harry? Page 87 of what, Harry? What is it, Harry? Then explain it to me. Tell me about the door. Do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... Harry? You remember opening the door? Harry, can you tell me about the sphere? What noise? It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry? Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. No. I didn't say that. Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. I can't. If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. I can't believe that, Harry. Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. So what? I don't follow you. Not a clue. Don't be so optomistic, Harry. Good point. I don't know what you're talking about, but good point. I mentioned it in my report. Didn't you read the report? But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. Which one? Let me get the list out. To what? Whatever I can do to help. Look, would you -- Wait a second, I -- No, why don't -- I'm fine. I'm not being defensive. Fine. I'm fine. What? About the time paradox. How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... Beth and Harry? How are the others? The ships? Does this mean what I think it means? Told me what? What report? Really? Captain who? No, they didn't say -- Just that. Careful, it's heavy. What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash? Geologists? At a plane crash? Who's everyone? Know what? What report? What report? You've heard of me? I'm in psychology. Was. Still am really, just been a while. I treat aircrash survivors. Of course he did. He's been isloated for 400 years. He wants someone to talk to. Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic. We're talking about 400 years here. An alien that shows emotional responses. I think we need to address him, before he reacts further. I'm not sure. Has Harry spoken with Jerry? What was it? Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect. When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. Well, he's polite. Well, how about we wait and see what Harry comes up with? The creature? This is like nursery school. Please, Ted. I don't see anything. You mean a picture? Like what? Earth doesn't have a patent on buttons, Ted. You want me to try? He wasn't feeling well. I don't know. What? Keep watching the news. Are you watching the news? Four. Four years -- Don't be so supportive, honey. He didn't say much at all. Honey -- You seen my suitcase?What sub? What was Edmunds doing outside? Too big? What? What is that? Don't make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here. Give him a chance. He's speaking our language, not the other way around. Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions -- What's inside the sphere. She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that. To what? Sir, about leaving -- Did you hear me, sir, because -- Can I stay, sir? I'm willing to risk it. I am. After what we just witnessed. Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know? See this red here. Maybe we didn't want to come back. Time travel. I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer. Considered what? That it's American? How would you think it's American? What's wrong? A foot and a half thick? That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation. Some sort of lead or something. Look at this. What are you going to do -- shoot her? What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open. I'd also like it noted -- Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. A half a mile long? He doesn't wait for an answer. By the bunks. Well, what's your theory? It doesn't make any sense. Well, they're not mine. No. I don't think so. Pussy. Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman. Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition. It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit. Thank you. What'd you say? See? No code. What'd I say? Yeah, I'll work on it, too. It's not a discharge. Right, Edmunds? You said before, right? So it's gotta be a message. Impotent? I'm not impotent. Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here. Looks like a design, some writing, maybe. Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message. Arrived? From where? Please. It must have flown here -- Meaning? An American spacecraft? Half a mile long? And buried 400 years? Yeah, good theory, Harry. If it is an alien spacecraft -- Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it. Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable. Why would this ship carry instructions in English? But it's impossible. Is it some sort of joke? Like one of those hoaxes? English? Alot like. You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... Gimme some room here, will you? Back off. Gimme some space. It's just like swimming, Norman... You know how to swim, don't you? What is it, Harry? What does Norman already know? What'd you say to him? Jerry isn't hostile, Norman. He said earlier -- we were his friends -- You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds? With what's out there? Not that I know of. Why? Barnes didn't know. Couldn't get a reading. Why's that? You want to put him on your couch, Norman. Grill him about his childhood? Unless it's an act. Sure, why not. Give him the trophy. That pretentious son of a bitch. You heard him, Norman. All that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit. And "impotent". Where does he get off saying I'm impotent? He's a fucking self-righteous, little prick. Inside the sphere. Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms. There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know? Don't you see it? It's a picture of the creature. Try this one. Squint harder. Take a look. I rearranged the numbers. Put 'em up to the light. Go ahead. Squint at it. It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation. He's manic, Norman. You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me? Totally misplaced. He's overlooking things. Obvious things. Still, make a note I recognized that. Strange, isn't it? You know -- how it would have a button. You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do? He's a pussy.I'd rather be with Mommy. Mommy's marrying Rache! I don't want to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter how much I like chocolate. I want to be a stud. I killed her! &quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot; I hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt... Annabelle sucked her thumb last night. IS THAT YOU? Doo-wop-doo-doo, doo -wop-doo-doo... Dad! You can talk him into anything! ...for Christmas, okay? Every magician needs a white dove, a real one, they do ! Are you real mad? &quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot; No! You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise. Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind. I made you some cocoa. See? Excuse me -- No! But you told us to starve. No. You touched it. No! Cocoa Puffs on Top -- Fruit Loops on the bottom. No. It's not good enough. Can I talk to you? When you're there. So where are you? But you can still see him. You dying. Rache says it's from you. Rache can do that part. I helped. Oh. How do you know? Heaven. I have to tell him he's made a mistake. He should take Grammy Martha first. Or Grandpa Norman. Before you. No! I have to get there. That's Rache's song! So you're okay. Is your bad? You have the WORST flu since... No. Nope. I got my warm t-shirt. Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy? And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son? Tomorrow? Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert? Mom...? I did. Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did. Yes. Where are you, anyway? Is that like Luigi's? And many meatballs. Rache says I have to eat lamb . I told her you're making me spaghetti ! If you want me to hate her I will. Mommy? I think she's pretty, Mommy. Does Rachel make a lot of money? Rachel's job is she works. Mommy? It's not Rachel's fault I ran away. I knew where I was all the time. Poof! You're happy now. Queen of diamonds. I have lava. Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?Cos she loves you . She wanted you to have a daddy to love. Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it. ...your hating me. You know, this horse smells really bad. You do NOT run out on your moth... Put down that goddamn camera! Annabelle put down that camera. There you are! That's my girl... Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust. And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what? A lot smaller. What happens next? We're going to win this. Yet another spaghetti night. You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab.... It's good. You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you? She's a charmer, you'll see. In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you. Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced? You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us. We should tell them together. WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years. We... It's a huge moment in their life -- It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there. I grew up, a little. I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm... I didn't think a phone call was appropriate... Getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day. Jackie...I've really given this a lot of thought. A great deal of thought... Still, please. I'm afraid she's going to walk. You know the kids aren't really in danger. This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and... Partly. But partly, you're mad. Don't do this. Jackie stop. We promised we never go there. Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes -- But he hasn't. He wandered off. I know it's terrifying. I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens. Our children. Jackie, we were taking them water- skiing for the whole weekend! You're WHERE? Good...Well...Take care. Fine. But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding. Me too. You ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill... I'll call from work. We can have a conference call. Thank you Mrs. Franklin. Jackie? This has been very valuable for us. And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight. Jackie, she was five minutes late -- Napalm. Jackie, they come to be part of my life. Rachel is part of that life. Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either. Rachel's not half my age. I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly. But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month. You think I didn't get that? I'm here. I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?! I'm here. Planning on getting -- Where you goin'? We make our lives, one step at a time. We do the best we can. The truth about the future? A promise. Is only a hope. That's not us. That's a pretty ugly thing you just said. '...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said. But I didn't leave. Restless. I told her I loved her. Can we go sit somewhere? She called it a fight. The fight. '...the kids have camp. Their friends are here. Over there, I'll just be shopping in a language I don't even know. My life, and the kids' lives, aren't here to service your mid-life crisis.' Did it go like that? I needed some time away.

No you don't. And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now -- It's complicated for Jackie. It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand -- Nobody's telling them to hate you -- They don't hate you -- But you're not good at this. Not yet. I'm sorry. I trust you of course I do but -- You don't need to. I don't expect you to handle them yourself. Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working... Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help. We have the kids this weekend, so... I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition. I might not be back until Saturday. Yeh, it's cheaper. I didn't want to spoil our supper... We have to talk. It was a veal stock, I thi...Do it! <i>Storm</i> music...Wagner... Cue music... Sweep the harbor. We're not watching the sea. What have we missed? All prop cars accounted for? Give me a shot from Truman's ring. What happened down there? What's on the ClockCam? Why wasn't I told? Any unpredictable behavior has to be reported. Is that the best shot we can get? Why is he in the basement? No, hold back... We've learnt about life as Truman has and, despite the complaints of a minority, it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience, for Truman and for the viewing public. I've been tempted. But I think it's important to retain objectivity. I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up. We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented. As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk. There's nothing on the show I don't use myself. Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in-- People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running. That's correct. In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue. He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started. Let me demonstrate some examples. As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family. Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player. Certainly a nomination. We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort. Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep? Not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth, he gives us a glimpse of ourselves. I prefer to think of it as a mirror. We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects. While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself. No scripts, no cue cards. It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine. That's how he can support an entire channel. It has to be the reality. As you know ratings have never been our primary goal. I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment. However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal. Amnesia. That and a fat, new contract. Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it. --a dead one at that. We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past. Thank you. Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss. I know you better than you know yourself. You're not going to walk out that door-- <i>You</i> were real. That's what made you you so good to watch. You're the star. A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions. I'm the creator.Let's take another call. London, England, you're on "Tru Talk." The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them. Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk." You've never actually met Truman, yourself. Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that? Why do you feel that Truman's never come close to discovering the true nature of his world? And it's all available in the "Truman" Show" catalogue. Operators are standing by. All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value. No, of course not. And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement. And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country. Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept. He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation. Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected. We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production. Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof. Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting. Are we talking Emmies? Let's go to some of those viewers' calls. But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps? A window onto the human condition? But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation? Let's talk ratings. "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself? Of course. How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence? I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show. How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again? --and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role. I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in. A master stroke. Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member-- The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman. Welcome.The thing that started all of this. Not the whole thing, Truman. You were right about one thing. And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you. Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i> It's a lot of world for one man. You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"? Who hasn't wanted to be somebody? Truman? It's me, Marlon. I need to talk to you. Really? That's the "Big Guy". Quite a paintbrush he's got. I went all over but I never found a place like this. Look at that sunset, Truman. It's perfect. No. What exactly? What're we doing here, Truman? I told you I can't. How about them? Who? Your Dad?! No. Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies... <i>Mixed up?</i> Mixed up in what? Are you okay? You look like shit. Sorry, I'm way behind. --Truman, what are you doing here? Sure. It's halogen. Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued. You coming for a drink? Trust me. I figured, what's the point? I knew I'd just be taking my problems with me. Once the kids came along, it made me look at Seahaven with new eyes. I realized, what the hell could be better than this? I'm telling you. What you really need is someone to carry on the "Burbank" name. Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time. Nursery? So when are you leaving? Yeah? Outta what?It doesn't matter. I'll make other arrangements. That's right. Why wouldn't I? You are a travel agent, aren't you? "Doris"? Your job is to help people travel. <i>A month.</i> Today. One. I'm sorry, er...the biggest one. <i>Fiji.</i> I want to book a flight to Fiji. --You never had a camera in my head. I have a map. Nothing was real. <i>A show.</i> Then who am I? The creator of what? Who are you? I...I can't. I think I've studied enough. Right now? We've got finals tomorrow. Actually, I'm free Sunday. Saturday? No? Really? Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza. How about Friday? You have a boyfriend? Of course you do. It's okay. I probably wouldn't talk to me either. I'm Truman, Truman Burbank-- Lauren, right? You take Japanese. What's that? So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--? This is different. Everybody seems to be in on it. I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow. Stay where you are! Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while. Yeah... When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island? Things. Things that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon? Like your whole life has been building to something? This is where it started. I've got to show you something. Could be. Beard looks phony. It's when I'm unpredictable. They can't stand that. That's why we've got to get out of here. Can you come with me? It's hard to tell. They look just like regular people. I think he's alive. I'll tell you about it later. I'm definitely being followed. I think it's got something to do with my dad. There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean? I think I'm mixed up in something. I'm onto something, Marlon - something big. I've got to talk to you. Marlon-- I can't tonight. You really think it could've dropped off an airliner? You think so? Yeah, what happened? <i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone. Up and away on that big steel bird. I'm going, don't you worry about that. It's not that simple. Takes money, planning. You can't just up and go. Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that. I've just got to move slow. Pick my moment. Bonus time's just around the corner. Soon as I finish the... See here, this is us. All the way round here, Fiji. You can't get any further away before you start coming back. Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot. Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i> I'm thinking of getting out, Marlon. --What are my plans now? Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i> Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you? No. You said, "Do something." Who were you talking to? Tell me! Who were you talking to?! Stop this now. I'll do it. I swear. You're part of this, aren't you?! What the hell has that got to do with anything? Tell me what's happening?! --What the hell are you talking about?! Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me. I've got my Seahaven Bankcard. I'm sure they're just exaggerating. I bet you did. Uhuh. There's no accident. It's just more stalling. It's hard to go places, isn't it? I think I'd like a little company. I've changed my mind again. What's New Orleans like this time of year? Mardi Gras. Or let's just see where the road takes us. Should I? Blocked at every turn. Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree? Because I never have. That's why you go places, isn't it? That's right. I do, don't I? Where shall we go? Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji. We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we? What about Atlantic City? Let's go now. Are you listening to a word I'm saying? I won't be here Sunday. --you're a nurse, aren't you? What do I do? Arrah! What's the hurry? I have to talk with you. But not here. Let's go for a walk. Good night, Mother. I still want to look over a couple of things. I'm not hungry. What did you want? How do you know? Fixing the mower. I saw my father today. I think I'm going to stay up for a while. That can wait. I want to get away. See some of the world. Explore. It'd be an adventure. Maybe I feel like a teenager. --We could bum around the world for a year on that. --I figure we could scrape together eight thousand. I've been thinking-- I won't be late. How did it go today? Gee, that's great. They're... perfect. Thank you. What's that? ...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>... ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...? It looks so small. We ought to be getting you back, Mother. I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin. Did Dad have a brother? They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow-- It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man. And you know what else was really strange? A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus. I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D? I've got something to tell you. You'd better sit down. How's your hip? How are you, Mother? You got it. Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there. Sure. Okay. Fine. Can you pass on a message? I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important. Well, thank you for your help. Is there any way around? Now what? I don't understand. Were you there--how do you know? --How do you know about that? There's no one here. Who? You can count on it. Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today? Not bad. I just won the State Lottery.You're not FBI agents. We don't even know you. Not supposed to talk about it. Yeah.They seemed to buy our story about the Hanta virus. You'll make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community. Maybe a small roadside memorial. Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen. Incinerate it. Like the others. No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it. How can this be? This man's still alive. Brought on by what? You've got something to show me. Kurtzweil, we think. Mulder was in Dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. He's gone back there again. Someone has tipped him. There are complications. Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body. Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis. We have a situation. The members are assembling.And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder. You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you. I told you -- he and I were old friends -- I've been using you?! Yeah, well I don't have them all. That would be my guess. What do you think? -- You saw this experiment? What? You found something? You can't. Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late. I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government. The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon. What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved. What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect. When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins. And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that. What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas? According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder? I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper. I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder? I don't either, but it sure sells books. You know my work? For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth. What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states. See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you. Do you? And one little boy. Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict. That's what I'm saying. Those people were already dead. No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing... What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building? S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb. I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas. I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN. Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight. Old friend of your father's. My name's Kurtzweil. Dr. Alvin Kurtzweil. Yeah, I did. No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that. Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.Sorry. Don't have one. Does what? What do I do. I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time. Yup. I need your clothes, Byers. They took her -- Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting -- When was that? Penetration but not perforation. What am I doing here? No. Don't bother. Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination. What's that? I'm looking for him. Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence? You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found. Have you examined them? Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.? I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found. Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters. You're a liar. You lied to me to gather information for you. For your goddamn books. Didn't you? You didn't know my father -- You've been using me -- You told me you had answers. Your guess? A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus. What did it look like? I'm not sure. A virus -- Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks. How can I reach you? And they tell me I'm paranoid. Negotiating with whom? A plague? I'll know soon enough. What killed those men? What was it? Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak? It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago. You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why? How? Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government -- You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why. They want to discredit you -- for what? Not according to the men in blue. I think you're full of shit. You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...? Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau -- Before the bomb went off? The Federal Building was too well guarded. He just let it explode. And what's that? Well, if you've got something to tell me, you've got as long as it takes me to hail a cab... Who sent you? You a reporter? How'd you find me? I know the name. Why? You follow me out here for a reason? Do I know you? How's that? Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully. You got me. But I think I know what they did with Jimmy Hoffa. We've got to keep moving. Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here. Scully -- I think you're in anaphylactic shock -- Scully... What? What happened? You saved me, Scully. As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing. I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win. I need you on this, Scully -- Just like that -- After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away -- We're close to something here -- we're on the verge -- You can't quit, Scully. What? What's wrong? I don't know. Come on! Run. Scully....? Maybe. Maybe not. You hear that? For the purpose of what? Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there. Very weird. I have no idea. Been where? It may be extraterrestrial. This virus -- it... Yeah, well they may this one. That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself. We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence -- What? Hey, I was right about the bomb, wasn't I? You think they went left? Where would they be going? What are my choices? And where are they going with it? Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks? No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks. Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say. This looks like new grass to you? And you've never seen anything like that? You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue? This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed. How was it contracted? What did you find? You said you weren't coming? -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away. I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by. Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too. What kind of infection? What did you find? Why are you whispering? We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you? I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced. I'd been told as much. You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris. It's like jelly. According to this tag. Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way. Get dressed, Scully. Is that what you'd like me to do? What are you implying, Scully? I was until about an hour ago. Why not? It's three AM. I wake you? You're... quitting? This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me. They were the ones that put us together. Why? What? What are you talking about? They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them. Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me. Something's not right... Scully? ...thirteen fifty six... Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven... Scully, get somebody to open this door. I'm in the vending room. Scully, I found the bomb. Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV? Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully? No you didn't. It's locked? What do you say we call in a bomb threat for Houston. I think it's free beer night at the Astrodome. How's that? The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced... What happened to playing a hunch? I think they have that covered. You're looking for a bomb. What's wrong, Scully? Did you find something? Where are you, Scully? Thank you. They can patch you in through the switchboard. Well, call General McAddie. General McAddie is who requested our coming here. We were awakened at three AM and told to get down here immediately. On whose orders? We're going to the morgue. I've got to find Scully. Are we being watched? How deep does this go? Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing -- Where's Scully?! I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device. -- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this. But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't. And they want to blame us? She was with me. About what? What about you? What alien environment? How? Let me out. Stop the car. Where is he? What happened to Kurtzweil? Why are you telling me this? But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha. That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy -- What do you mean, walked? This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease? A virus? You're lying. What is it? I want to know where Scully is. About the conspiracy? Is she alive? Where's Scully? What happened to Kurtzweil?Who? Do they know? My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken. Into what? Who called this meeting? Is it an emergency? Yes. My life is over. Go. Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future. The vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. Its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we've so assiduously protected for the last fifty years. Or it may not. You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project. Driver. Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk. As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future. I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked. The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone. He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future. Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species. Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children, The only future any of us have. Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race. Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine. Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known? Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs. No! For God sake you've got it all backwards. A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks. No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet. A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours. I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use. I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed. Yes. I have answers for you. He's come and gone. Mr. Mulder. No, you need only take away what is most precious to him. You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him. No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank. Our vaccine may have no effect! And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all. In hope of what? Learning that it's true?! That we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?! This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie! My god... More concerns than that? I'm sorry. My grandson fell and broke his leg.We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car. That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person! Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident... Don't touch her. Call 911. I need a drink. Excellent. I didn't hear you. What did you say? What? Go home! Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck. You fucking bastard! If you ever touch my minivan again, I'll make you sorry. Real sorry. And you're a little fucking reject. Fucking Boyd. That fucking idiot. They're on to us. What are you fucking talking about? The hell I don't. I have plenty of friends. Don't point at me. What did you say? This is pathetic. It's sacrilegious. Why?! Why was the floor wet? Playing? She's dead. Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway... I don't have to... Multiple reasons. You're an asshole. No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me. It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak. Sorry Fish. No first of all. I'm not in a game mood. We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then. No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at all. I got children. I've got a life. I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out. I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work. I didn't do anything! I'll turn your pathetic ass in! I don't give a damn. They're on me. They're smoking me out! At the seven-eleven. I can't do this. Fuck you Boyd! Don't talk to me about character. Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure! You got us into this mess. Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down! We are all going straight to hell. Either hell or prison, whichever comes first. I am not flexible on this. Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs. That is absolutely not true. No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them. According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace. No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases. We can't do this. Wait. Wait a minute. I'm not wrecking the transmission! Have you ever done this before? What about the blood? You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony? So I didn't fucking do it! Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem. Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone? You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman. Sure, why not. I'm calling the police. Just stop. Stop it! That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here. We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police. You're a lying deviant. What did you do?! Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating. We have to call the ambulance. Calling the ambulance. I'm calling the ambulance. What are you talking about? What? She's got no fucking pulse. Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life. You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries. Don't even start. I'm not getting a ticket. There is no candy! Later. What? They're driving me nuts! Where's the bathroom? I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack... Have you thought about what I said? We are. We go to the police. We tell them the truth. Now. Before they find out. Now. We save ourselves. You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent. I want you to hear me out. It has to be done. Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911. Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little... If anything ever happens to me... I tell mine that they're little men. I tell them they're strong. They make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So they really know that I need them just as much. You know. Just as much man. And you know, you're their godfather... Don't eyeball your kids. Don't ever stare him down. Then fuck what your father said, cause I'm gonna tell you right now...You'll know what it's all about, why you got married and why you love her when you wake up at three in the morning, and the streetlight's coming through the window and it's just catching a corner of her face, like a sleeping angel. And her hair smells sweet and she's your's. She's all your's. Do you see where I'm going here? Are you solid with that? No. No. No. It's what my father said to me. He said it and he meant it... He said to me...He said, Adam, he said...He told me and I heard him... he said... Hell he said so many Goddamn things I can't remember everything he said for Christsake. They've all been real times. And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life, as you prepare for new roles; father, husband, teacher, you will, as I have, come to except the letting go of of old ways. Soon, the mellowing will begin... That's one idea. I know you'll be. Three hours.All right. Let's all go back in. Adam? You're cool right? They won't figure it out. It has worked. Adam! Calm down. You got some mighty fucking fine bad timing Adam. We got a rehearsal situation here. Nobody's smoking anybody out. Who? What are you talking about? What? What is your problem? Any time fat boy! Watch the tone fella. Lighten up Adam. Show some character. Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head. What does that mean? Wrong. That is flat out wrong. Hell is for cowards, for hypocrites who fear to live by the strenght of their own convictions. This is war. Given the circumstances, and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we have chosen life over death. Two wrongs don't make a right. So our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less. Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud. Alright. Let's do it. We have to get going. Well what the fuck are we supposed to do? She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia. So that's what we're doing. How do you figure? We've already done this. What? Sun rises at 5:52. The reality is, you take away the horror of this situation, take away the tragedy of the death, take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned, beaten, into your head since grade one. What are we left with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 lbs. that must be moved from point A to point B. Now, a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line. But that line exists and I see it.I see that line. Trust me. Adam. Trust me...I can take care of this. Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works. We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear. Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done. She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down. Her fucking head was caved in. It's a marble floor, we can clean it up. Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows. We can do this. We can get her out of here. Bury her out in the desert. What were we doing officer? Why didn't we help her? Well...we're all a bit high, you know, bachelor party, that kind of thing. Fisher here is getting married in three days...Beautiful wife ...he didn't have anything at all to do with it...It was all Micheal here... just Micheal... Just giving the facts. There's more. Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options. Call the police. Okay, that's one option. Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just take a second here and take hold of the situation, OK? Let's just review our options here. Are you sure this was an accident? Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead? Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME! Why? Why? Why? She's dead. Why are you calling an ambulance? Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing? What do you think you are doing? What are you doing? Wait! You don't know what you're doing. More. I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I? Prison Communications. One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars. You want to hear me out? Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change. Lois please. He's upset about Adam. We're all upset. Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing... Nothing happened in Vegas. I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from... What are you talking about? She's in there! Great. Fine. Perfect. That's right. She's in the bathroom...she's still working. That's right. Yup. Who? She's here. She's just...Hold on a second. She's not here. What? What is it? He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go. You guys stay here. Give me two more. What is her disposition? I'm not talking to you? The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives. I got her arm. We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground. Where do you look? What side of the neck? Jack Kerouback, Herman Melville, Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson. I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing. So from sun set to sun rise, let me be heard... But not tonight. Fine. Don't come crying to Boyd. No sir. That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big. Fish? I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark! And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money! Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive. I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money. Whatever you say Kojak. Okay fine. You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation? My what? This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most. Hold on a sec. Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning? That's right. That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth. Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal. I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there? Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation. You got a nasty side to your thought process. And what does that mean? Are you insane?! You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you? Take care of business. Just do it. After you drop the kids off, take Micheal home. Put a few drinks in him so he'll sleep. Suck my ass. Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police? You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes. Exactly! Exactly my point. What you just said. Say it again. Say it again. Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done? What is the question you asked me? What did you ask me? He is not cracking up. No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in there in pieces. How about a little sensitivity? Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior. OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here. The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left... Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey. However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right? No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you... ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker. Go ahead. What kind of words? That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves. So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them. Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that? All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan. Nobody knows she's here. What's insane is the fact that Micheal here put a fucking girl's head through a toilet. That's insane. Nobody knows. Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens? They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal... Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose... Shut up. Shut up. No. She's all your's Fish. Anything you want. Happy bachelor party. Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English... That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars. Prison Communication Systems. An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir. Who's up for making some real money? Well, I didn't mean it. Come on tough guy. Listen to me. You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me? Okay Micheal, let's go. Upsy daisy big guy. Give me the Valium. Stop. Stop it! Micheal get a grip. What did you tell her? We're not goosed. Easy Micheal. You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want? The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know? This is going to stop right now. Right now! No. I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel. Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all. Not a problem. Understand not my words, but follow my orders. Follow my orders. A little gut check time fellas. A time for some serious self-exploration. How do I function? For real? No more bullshit. Can I keep my cool when they bounce my bananas? When they won't play my fucking song? etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get me? That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right? The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction. Lock up the chickens, dig up the holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long, stick it all on a big fucking tug boat. The whole country picks up and takes Mexico. Take Mexico. There's my point exactly. Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right? I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot. Then what do they have? If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see? New king. I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night. Not true. False. I don't hate women. Oh really? Starbucks? Moore? I never heard that. The hell I did! The hell I did! You're a fucking moron.I got you. Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please? I don't think so. What. No way. What happened? Oh my God... I know... I know and I'm honored... I won't do it. The bucks gonna stop right here. If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down. No. I think it's fucked. Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. My father said, first of all, I'm your father not your friend. I'm your father. Real times. No...we want padded chairs...okay? We'll be ready Adam. You need help. Not a prayer. You're sick. I'm serious. Fine? Fine what? I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things! You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly. I'm getting really tired of your bullshit. Isn't it a little late? Now? Hear what? Yeah. What does that mean? I don't know... What does that mean? What are you going to do? I don't think that's such a good idea. Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him. No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right. Regarding what? What's your point? I just want to get married. What? I don't know! I just want to get married. I said, what have we done? What? Boyd...What have we done? He's cracked up. Easy Boyd. He's having a problem here. Shut up Boyd. No, the problem, as I recall, was the lack of blocking... You always were a jealous man. It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives." Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this. I'm talking about prayer. I think we should say some words over the grave. I'm calling the police. Good God...Good God... Oh God. This is insane. Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here. Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys! Call 911. She's dead. Call somebody! Oh, Jesus...call the police. I can't. We need padded chairs. No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay. Not really. Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs... Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're doing my wedding and I'm calling about the chair situation. Yeah, I'll hold. You said that Boyd. I do. What? Are we supposed to? Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there. But... No... What? I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of... ...I just love you so much...So much... Move the bodies? So what do we do? I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried. Like if something happened to him, he could still get us. He kept saying he was protected. What money? But... But... She's not alone...She's...Boyd...Oh God...He's gone nuts...He killed Lois and Micheal...it's all... She's in the desert. She's out in the desert. It's too late. Micheal, by accident. No Micheal did. It was an accident. The prostitute. Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident. Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We... Do you love me? Do you love me? Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off. No it's not okay. It's not. Yes. That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids. Okay. Okay. Don't we already have someone to do that for us? No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back. I know. Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset. Can we just talk this out? Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying. No baby. We'll all be right in. Everything's OK. Just some more preparations. Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. I just...we're just taking care of some Groomsmen last minute business. Yeah. Sure. Yeah baby. Everything's great. This is our honeymoon. "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me. I'm working on it. No. No. I'll see you in about four hours. I left a message. I think it's going to be okay. What! Okay. No. Just like an hour or so. We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late. Hey. It's me. I'll see you tomorrow... I'm mad at you. Nesting? What are you doing? Well I do. I'm working on it, I've made three calls. I can't stop thinking about how much I love you. Not yet. Hi. I love you. Of course. I will. We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off. More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever. I'll call them from the road. We're leaving in three hours. Honey I don't have the time... Go down where? So what do we do? What kind of seats can we have? I'm not. What's the problem? Okay. Problems? With all my heart. Of course. You will not be common!!! I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body. That's absurd. Time out. You expect more what? He's a great chef. He just doesn't talk a lot. He's quiet. I've known him since Cub Scouts. What does Moore have to do with your growing? You don't like Moore? Since when? Who else? I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth. What are you talking about? He's my friend. He's not a moron. He is. It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding. How do you figure? They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it. I wouldn't know. Are we going to do this again? I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else. Stop it. I'm sorry. What? Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's. How could I know what else I forgot? I'm not playing around. I forgot. I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry. Why what? I think so. I think I forgot the tent. Yes. Yup. Sent it. Sent it. I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are. I think so. I'm not sure. I don't think so. We missed the deadline. Government cutbacks. OK, OK. You guys just go back in. Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll be right in. Go on. Yeah, Dad. It's great. I love you dad. Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle." You never walked away dad. You could have walked away. You did all right dad. What is it? I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit. I think so. The wahoo moment? The wahoo? Have another drink. I don't hear it. Buzzing? Where did you get that? Dear God...I don't know how to pray. I'm getting married... Go for it. He's your brother. Lately I'll just start getting lightheaded, dizzy, and I realize I haven't breathed in like two minutes. I'm not breathing right. I just want her to be happy. About what? What does that mean? I don't know. She's really been stressing out. Yup. I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother. That's a good one. Yeah? There. That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never. I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn." Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me? Did he try to kiss you? My God... Downstairs in the closet. Greenpeace? A move? Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me. I have no idea. I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter. The first day. I got to agree with that. No...No. Yup.You go home! Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you. You got a retarded kid and a fat pig wife. You're a loser. Eat my ass! About anybody but yourself. You never have. They're not on to us. I'm gonna call Boyd. You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems. The hell you do. You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends. You're not a team player. You're pathetic. Why? I don't know why the floor was wet! The floor was wet. She slipped! We were playing...she slipped...she hit her head. I was just playing...we were playing just playing around. Franco mother-fucking Harris! Name one. Oh, and why am I an asshole? You're an asshole Adam. Boyd brought up divorce statistics. Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed? You're interrupting a personal conversation. First of all... I love you. How about my Fatburger? Goosed! Goosed! We're goosed! Goosed by God! We're goosed. He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out. Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America. Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime. Ball park sausages. You will not screw this up. You said nobody would miss her. Not really, no. They need leadership. What? What? What's your point? The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies. What's your point? They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something. Israel doesn't have a King. And what happens when you can't? You have a King fantasy. True. You hate women. Your ideas never work out. Nope. You said one in two marriages end in divorce. The hell you didn't! It's my fucking opinion. Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right. If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just... No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois. I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it? You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things. That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me? The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me? Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo". Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem. Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull. Do you hear buzzing Fish? At the newsstand on 3rd. Just go ahead and say what's on your mind. I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... Come on. I'll take a ride. So? I don't care for him. You're not breathing right? Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button... Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes... Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343. Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body. Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9. I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards. It means she's insecure. Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters. That's just insecurity. I said out of respect. Respect for you Fisher. For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride. There will be no more rain. You see where I am here? You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect. I KILLED MY BROTHER! Right. Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man. Desert. It was an accident! Drum banging real times.Can't do what? I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore. They'll get us on accesory to murder. Jesus. She's fucking hot! The stripper's here. He's too drunk. He just had two. What's goosed? What's your fucking point? Today is the best day of the rest of our lives. Here's his head. He's right. Left side. Keith Richards, Dean Martin... Not tonight. I don't think so Boyd. Your investment ideas never work out. No I don't. Well that ought to be about the end of that. That's what I'm thinking. I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think? I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing. Where? Pup corn? I guess. You alright? All week long. He said he was the Brain Trust. Said he was smarter than all of us. He started reading "Atlas Shrugged," staring at himself in the mirror. He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his. Where's Boyd? Maybe go up to the North Pole, the Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart guns. I've always had a pretty good aim... Greenpeace. I'm thinking about maybe making a move. You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious. Did she believe you? What? Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head. How do you know she's dead. That ought to be about the end of that. I don't think that's a good idea. Shut up Micheal. That's right. Fucking desert. She's dead. Good times.Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here. Everything okay? I love you so much it hurts. Me and your mother marvel at what you have become. You're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl. I feel it deep inside. A wonderful, magical journey. And I'm, like I said, just so proud of how you turned out. You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. Knock'em dead! Just kills me... I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me. I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am. I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing. I'm just so Goddamn proud of you...God knows I didn't always play it right with you...Second you get something on those teeth, I want it What about the blood? The teeth doin' any talkin'? How soon can we get something? The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's. Where's Lombardo? If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise. Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you... What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming? Will you do me one favor? Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance. You don't think Sam could've put it there? The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there. But he's made a mistake. Those are Suzie Toller's teeth. Just check out the car. I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me? It's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins... I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened. I did that once. I don't want to do it again. Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it? Guess I kind of lost it there. What? You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter? Cone on. She bought the same story we did... I net a guy in a bar. You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp. I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it. Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck. The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his. They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start. Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday. I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless... Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place. You saw the news today? It's a shithole. But she was dirty, what was I gonna do? This is where she lives. She wants to talk. Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all. I busted her once for possession. she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine. You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay? Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his. I don't imagine he gives a shit now. You're telling me you believe the guy? Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her. I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt? It's our job, Gloria. That would make it about the time of her old man's suicide. You don't think that could explain some erratic behavior? I've got that two o'clock in town. The teeth, were they... She looked shaky, but lucid. I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door... I think I looked away. A split second. Then, bingo. Just like that. She puts a knee into my groin. There was this coffee table between us and the wall. She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case. Thing had a glass door. I could hear it breaking. I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough. Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun. I yelled at her to put it down. She got off a shot. I took it in the shoulder. I... I had no choice. I returned fire. Two rounds, I think. In the chest. I told her I was coming with her. She nodded, like she understood. We stood up together. Bit, scratched. But I had her pinned. She calmed down. I was going to cuff her... She said she thought she was going to be sick. She asked to use the bathroom. I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder. I did her rights. I fucked up. I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do? Kelly's next, Gloria. You think this is just about money, about us looking foolish? Question him. You're gonna find a stone cold manipulative psychopath. And those girls are going to wind up dead... I don't believe I'm hearing this. A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse. They were acting. They were all acting, from the beginning. And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money. You heard Kelly say "Sam." That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the girls... We've got three. Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops. Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her. That's bullshit. Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for... Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys... I say something funny? Lombardo ever come out here? You and Suzie used to come out here together? I'm not on your property! Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly. I've been a cop for a while, Kelly. It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three. And then there's the love angle. I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money? The thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out. You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together? Curiosity, I guess. Suzie Toller is dead. You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way. I'm placing your daughter under arrest. Where is she? Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan. Let me in. Now. You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo. Sam, for godsake. You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him... That's right. That was his name. Don't you see what this means? You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money? You, the pill-head with the rap sheet? Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to. We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit... Is that what you think? You have friends? Is that what they told you? You, Kelly, Sam. Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts. Somebody's got to go. Well, you're half right. Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me. Yeah, they're bad for your health. I'm tryin' to look out for you... You ought to watch it with that shit, Suzie. You get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser. It doesn't look like it. No. So Suzie, you called us, remember? Meet my partner, Gloria Perez. That how you planned it? You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean... Yeah, or get me drowned. I thought this was supposed to be a vacation. Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat? You mean this thing? Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle? Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it. We should be celebrating. This thing worked out just like you said, only better. Hey, what did you want me to do, die? The bitch shot me, is what happened. Sit down, Lombardo. With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra... But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her. Isn't that against the rules? But she ran away. And she began to cry. And you put an arm around her. But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about. And she wanted to talk. In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt. The one you bought at school. Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.How you doing, Artie? That's great. I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist. No problem... Shit. I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it. This is insane. ... is accusing me of rape. Jimmy told me. Apparently I'm the last to know... Talk to me Artie. I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie. I'd like that. I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right? I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. You look pretty. Senior class fund-raising gig. I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep. Hey, come on. It's for a good cause. Kelly. Eat a power bar. Kelly's file. Read it. You're going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who's made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she'd never identify. I don't know what to say... Maybe she used another name. How long? Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows? There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house. There's phones there. I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found. I don't know... Maybe I should have called. But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself. I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office. No. Again. I think we covered this. I told her I was going to call a cab. If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour. A ride. You want one? What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride? Hey, you're working for it. Least you're supposed to be. Thank you, Jimmy. Come on. Beats study hall, doesn't it? You think that's wise? I love you. Now give me the line. That's not your line. So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you. Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich. And you believe her? Yeah, he got her busted for possession... Duquette. Forget him... Hello. I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it... Okay. I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool. All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake. I'm doing what rich guys do. I'm spending my money. It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing. Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds. Then do it. I need you on this Kelly. Do it tonight. We'll figure something out... Okay? No! Christ. Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you. You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes... Shit. I was afraid of that. She left this garbled message on my machine. Can you calm her down? Kelly. Is Suzie there? We have to stick with the plan. The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves... From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental. I thought that was understood... God, you scared the shit out of me. You must be crazy coming here. About six and a half million dollars. Jesus Christ, what are you doing? Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what you've been through... I should've seen something like this coning. Kelly... All right. I'll have to look for it. Jeez, that thing... Can't you... So, where you off to now? In back of the garage. No I didn't. Check out the Jeep. It's nice and dirty for you. But you might want to wait a minute. The Mercedes is leaving. I won't. Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off. Just like that? I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay. I lost the house. It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare. I just want my life back... There's nothing for them to get. Nellie Gail Ranch... What's that supposed to mean? Can't you take that stupid thing off? I know how deep her pockets are, Ken. I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank? Forget it. Good thinking. Ken. I'm in some trouble. I need an attorney and you're the only one I know. So I figured I'd start here. Come off it, man... It was an accident. Jesus, man... You okay? Come on, man. I'll make a sailor out of you yet. Yes, we call it a winch. And these are shrouds, and these are stays. Kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed. What I'm telling you is, I don't like surprises. Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something? You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake. Yeah, well, you fixed that. What the hell happened, anyway? Fuck you. This is bullshit. I'm outta here. It is and I don't. Ordinarily... But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying... That's right. Yes. Mainly to turn her toward the door. I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office. I could, but it's confidential. Look, the point is, we didn't talk. I told her this was not an appropriate time or place. Yes. Yes. Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it. Anyway, I'm going through a drawer. I hear a car. I look out the window. I see Nicole driving away. I leave my room, and there's Kelly. I had to go look for this coupon. Story's the same, Detective... I think there's some things you do, you don't want to see yourself doing them. How... We? Yeah, real funny. You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot. What's wrong? That was the same thing Ray said. But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on... That was about as grim as it gets. No, no. Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play. We'll go through it all again tonight. I was worried about you, Suzie. I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up. Good. Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us. Shut up. Don't fall apart. The only people who can blow this is us. Remember? Put Kelly on too. Jesus. Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change. Goodbye, Sandra. So maybe I'm a one-woman man. Didn't you see her this morning? No. Sandy... What's up? Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time. Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans. I can't, Sandy. I've got to run. Can't. Got a passenger. Hi, Sandy.
