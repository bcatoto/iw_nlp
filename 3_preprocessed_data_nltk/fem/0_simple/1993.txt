Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem. 'Drugged' is a stupid word. Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised. Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess. FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT. I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet. Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear. ......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet�kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag. Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy. Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink. No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it." Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.' About... Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich�s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl. Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend... Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores? Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard. But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte. She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City. The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture! Is everything getting worse? What do you believe in then? Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink? The Clock People? Siwash, huh? Clockworks? What was that? But I don't know how to polka. Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help... I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's. Where are the others? You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling. Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving. I don't. I'm staying with the Countess. If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts.... But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years. No, I guess not. How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here? So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes? That's Jellybean! You don't agree with Debbie, then? What is Debbie's position? Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink? You're political, then? About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl. Tell me about it. No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone. Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast. My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore. I have to go, Julian. Getting dressed. I've got to go. It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds. I'm cold. As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace. When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways. I'm the best. Yep. I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off. I was a successful model once. American Cheese. The king of road food. Going north? I don't know anything about it. Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However... What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship? Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think... But Countess... If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him? The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings. A job for me? Your ranch? Bonanza Jellybean? Does that mean you might have an assignment for me? I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be. A born freak can only go uphill. Tired...There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that. ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years. ...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before. You lose! Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend. That's not true! ...That's not true. An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. Carryin' a gun. My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. You think Early's bad to me, don't you? Do what? Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week. No it is not! You took this picture? Your pictures. Can I see 'em? What's this? Could I try that? You can? I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before? Better not, or Early'd whip me. Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor. Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day. You wouldn't have any color film, would ya? Is it hard to learn? Are you takin' the pictures? That French ain't it? What? One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over... ...I said, I like your hair. Hi, I'm Adele. I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people. Early! Stop!! She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen. ...I don't know. ...thank you. I don't know, they didn't speak too good English. It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth... Early, what're you doin'? Early, sing me a song. Early, can we stop there... just for a little while. How many times you gonna tell me that? Geez, they look kinda weird. Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? What if they're dangerous? Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. What'll we do out there? I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. Almost. I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes. Early, you are so sweet....I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. What? The police are after him, he's a murderer! Jeez... Adele! ...Anything else? What's Early been in jail for? Yeah. Adele... are you serious? You shouldn't let him do that to you... Hold still. That's me. Took 'em all. Sure. It's a portfolio of my work. I'm cool. You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want? How'd you meet Early? I haven't... I'm a fast learner. He whips you? So you don't do any of those things. You dropped this. ...Yeah, sure. Not really. ...Yeah. Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. Karma. ...Thank you. ...Pardon? Carrie. What about you? What are you going to do? I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real! Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do! Brian I want him out of our car! Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference. I can't believe I agreed to do this. I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you? I'm finished. What's that? Look again! Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian! She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail? Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her. You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang. Fuck! I don't want to talk about it. You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else. Up yours. Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock? You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced? Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay. Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. Funny, very funny. I still think we should have met them first. What did he sound like on the phone? It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you. A book on the warehouse murders? This mean your finally going to finish your thesis? Why? So how's it going? Thanks. What are you doing? Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean. No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late. Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can. I thought you wanted to be a writer. Mmm... I love it when you talk like that. It was definitely the high point of the evening. The party? Who do I have to blow to get out of here? Thank god! Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr! ...Soon as he finishes his thesis. ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries. Not yet. ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face. You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me. ...You're hurting me... He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane. Early, just think... Siesta. No, never. Excuse me. No. ...Brian hurt his foot. No, thanks, I can manage. Where's Adele?I don't want to talk any more. That's why I left, moved to Washington. When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly. Pretty dull. Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil. We wanted to stay together, so we talked them into funding some wilderness photography... and here I am. How did she..? Oh. Had? My dad was a Navy doctor. Six months. Why? Sam? We haven't seen him. Somewhere along the pipeline. The radio's on the fritz. -- Corbett's a killer. I was hoping you had some news -- Have you talked to Eric? My home is here. With you. Technology in the wilderness. Only problem is talking to you on your way to the landing strip. You're hurt. I'm staying. So what's the problem? Where's Corbett? What's going on? Oh, Christ, sweetheart. Four days! I thought you were dead, or worse. That's my line. Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him. Wait a second. High-tech in the wilderness. Gets me excited, too. Not me. I'm equipped. Winter. Two straight months of night -- we may never get out of bed. Which would suit me fine. I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures. Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty. What's that? Do I want to be with you permanently? Yes, I think I do. But be with what you do and the way you live? That I don't know. C'mon, Eric, until I met you, coming back to Alaska was totally Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone. It's been nice so far. We're together -- That's not what I meant. I'll wear it for you. And I can wear it when we go home. We won't be here forever. Oh, sweetheart. It's beautiful! Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric. Was there any trouble? Did you catch Corbett? Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business. The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do. I call it 'the Turtle,' as in carrying your home on your back. I bet you haven't had lunch. Great idea -- pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a high-powered hunting rifle. Be careful -- there're two of them. What are you doing? Be right back. I left my camcorder in the car.Yes. Horrible. He was tired and pale. Yes. I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial. Yes. No -- never. Six years. No -- but I can get it for you. Rebecca Lawson. I assume his girlfriend. I had some papers to pick up. A little after eleven. Because he called me. No. To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail. I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone. What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now. Yes. You take what people say and make it ugly. You make others believe what you want them to. She should have been found guilty. She shouldn't have gotten off. No! Why would I want to kill him? No. I don't know. P.M. Three fifteen. Dristan nasal spray. Yes. Yes. Yes. She talked him into it. She wanted everything. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. I've been to a few -- yes. I've tried it. I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest. As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will. I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I didn't kill him. Yes. Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago. That bastard! Who told you that? Yes. I suppose it's possible. I don't know. I'm not sure. I suppose. Yes -- he mentioned it. He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it. Yes-- It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty-eighth. What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial? I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh. When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial. Yes -- cocaine. No. I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find their little toys all over the place. Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had. I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it. I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca. He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough -- and well... I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.There was an inquiry. It was his word against mine. They believed him. I was fired. While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary. Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs. He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over. Yes -- he did. He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him. He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable. I realized he wasn't serious. He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it. We dated for about a month last year. I'm a nurse. I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr. Paley's on staff there. Yes.That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious. No. No. I haven't done it in years. I have. Don't listen to him. Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me. No -- he's lying. Shoot him. Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite. So, sue me. Things have changed. I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again. I've been thinking about that. I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance. You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy. That's crazy. Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see you right away. I've got the tape. No -- I'm a survivor. You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do. No -- you're not. I do need you. No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it. I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that. You're too weak, Frank. When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it. If something gets in your way you remove it. Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine. To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today. Are you scared? Tonight we open new doors. Sugar or honey? Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out. I'm sure you'll be able to handle him. Something wrong? You can see me now. You were brilliant today. Of course. I went out on the boat. I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out? I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying. It isn't true. You have to believe me. She's mistaken. What? There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank. No -- that's what I know you were thinking. You and me -- making love. Yes -- it would be nice. It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want? That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened? Really? Did you always want to be a lawyer? It won't be that hard. I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me. Sorry. Andrew loved this old cabin. He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful. Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind. I wish he'd had a chance to do it. No -- not at the office. I've got a better idea. Yes -- she did. Hi, Frank. Hello? Not true. Shall I tell you what you were thinking? You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt. Tastes can change. That's not an answer. I'm the photographer. What do you think? Is it against the law? Why not? I know. Can we get out of here? We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left. I was at a cocktail party. Very trendy. Andrew was in Chicago on business. He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling. He looked so helpless. Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it. When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down. Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined. I don't know if it's something I can explain to you. Yes. I thought the subject was sex? Something like that. Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion -- such savage emotion. They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. Not really. I am who I am. I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are. I like sex different -- I like it wild. That's not a crime. I loved Andrew. We made love together. We made it differently, but we still made love. It was our way. It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice. If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me? I'm used to being on the outside looking in. The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together. Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs. Frank! He'll file. He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others. And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney. You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint? Do you think I did it? Are you going to represent me? It didn't get there from me. No -- never. Six thirty -- and he was very much alive. Yes. I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.Frank -- stop it! Stop it! I don't want our lives ruined because of this. I love you, Frank. I want this to work -- but you have to help me. You have to come back from where ever it is you are. It was a place to start. You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me. Why didn't you come to me? We can't pretend this isn't happening. Talk to me. Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael. It's bad enough that you are. It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me. You're sleeping with her, aren't you? This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me. Why did you lie to me? Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you? Where have you been? That's what I was hoping you'd tell me. We have to talk. Is that alright, Frank? No one's asking you not to work. I just think you could make some time for your son. Why don't you talk to him now? Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him. Yes. She sounds like quite a woman. What's she like? If he files are you going to take the case? How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults? I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set. He could let you have your vacation. We're supposed to go to the lake. No -- it has to be done by tomorrow. If you want me to. Really. This is not relaxing. You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing. Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go! Don't use language like that at the dinner table. Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling. Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well. That's too bad.Where's the radio? If you can't make it back, I'll hold up at the Douglas Shaft. Stop worryin'. You sound like a mother hen. I copy. And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings. If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall. He said the Tower, but he's on Comb Bluff? Frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the Douglas Shaft. Hal's signalling he's OK. There's a lot more where that came from. You're not leaving again? What about you?! Gabe? Wait 'til I get over there. Tie the rope so I can come across. Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone. Forget it! I refuse! I'm going to wrap it around your throat! Enough's enough. How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind. I won't do it. No way. Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe? Hand-holds?! I can barely see them. Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind. What about you? My heart can't take much more of this. Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station. Forget it. You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go. Hurry up, time is money. If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first. I'm holding you to that. Gabe, what about Frank? Thanks for holding on. Don't let me fall! Gabe! Frank! No, Frank! Frank! I've never weighed 135 lbs.! Never This rope is sixty years old! What? We might be able to go that way. They'll kill him! He has no idea! Get it! No luck? Gabe are you alright? Can you see light? Gabe! Are you alright? If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person. Breathtaking. Want me to lead? I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you. If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it? Gabe...your arm? Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change. What we had was perfect. No, actually it was more like mutual attacking. Can you think of something more romantic than attacked? It was great. Remember the first time we came up here? You still wear the cable necklace I gave you. Neither can I. What do you think they're doing now? I'm glad you find humor in this. Do you know what people would do for that? What about you? You know me, I'm a night person. Excuse me? For the same reason you did, to help. I can't. The radio's at the bottom of the shaft. But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper. Where's Hal, what's going on? Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked. You look frozen. What's happening?! Looking for Hal. Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back. Gabe!? Can't do it? I don't believe this. Don't you feel anything? I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible. Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge. If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem-- You mean the nerve. What if he can't? That's not the issue here, those people are. He can't do it alone. If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down. He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks. Thank God you didn't leave. We just got a Mayday. Seven climbers stranded off Comb Bluff. The weather's pouring in fast and Hal's gone up alone. You know where everything is... I'm late for my shift. And I can't leave. You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave... This was our home, now it's my home. I can't leave. You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it. And you shouldn't either. Where? Gabe, did you come back to stay? You didn't. Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint. Listen to you... The old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh? A flare up... Which could maybe what? Resuscitation? I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay? Did I miss something? Excuse me? You're saying, I don't understand? I'm the only one who does understand. I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all. Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you. But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I understand you . I don't understand? Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better. I was there, you were the only one who didn't panic. So do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt. You held on as long as you could. Yes, everything did go wrong, starting with Hal. I mean, what was he doing up on the Tower with a girl who could barely climb? Why can't you believe that you did everything you could? I know... Had to leave? Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what? We stayed. Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason. Where've you been? Hello, Gabriel. The winds are picking up. Don't believe it... You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out. Oh, please. Enough. You can stop right there. He knows it well. Oh, my God! I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. Gabe? Gabe, where are you? Wait, I think I have them sighted. What's the word, Frank? Patience my love, patience. Then it's a deal. Oh, my God! You gotta be kidding me! Do you want me to fly up after you? Over. Where's the rest of the team? Who's going with you? Got to be Comb Bluff. Go after her. Copy. Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances to me or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.Yeah... It could be fun. Oh... I lived with a President. It isn't any fun. So this is it? ... Me, too. I know. Yeah, well... It's finally over. ) Thought I needed a little change. You like it? Hi. Yeah. He's a good man. I sure fall for some weird guys. You really believe that? They're crucifying you out there. Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done. I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange... I can't. Yeah... Bedtime. It was inspirational. But you could go to jail for it. You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it? I can't keep all of this a secret. It's just more than anybody else does around here. You find people jobs? Yes. So what do you do the rest of the time? You have a lot of secrets. I really don't have much of an appetite. What? He wasn't always like that, anyway. I lock at you and I see Bill... I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and... It's just so strange... Oh... Okay. Thanks. You don't have to keep walking with me. I'm okay from here. You sure this goes somewhere? I don't know. I hadn't thought it out that far. You1re leaving, too? Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them. Home. I'm not the First Lady, anymore. I shouldn't be here. I'm sure they did. 'State of Emergency.' 'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution? When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now? After the election... What's going on here? Dave hesitates. I mean, what is it? Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.' Where is he? You weren't in the state legislature. Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature. Oh, I don't think so. Still, you helped a lot of people. That was quite a thing you did today. Mind if I sit down? I saw the light. I thought maybe you were up. There's no mistake, Bill. If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake. You made their funding disappear! That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes... ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick... ... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine. I can handle it. But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this. Oh, come on, Bill. Don't patronize me. I'm not one of your little... Turn around. I'm talking to you!... Turnaround! Yeah. I'm sure it's keeping you up nights. Since when do you care about the homeless? You don't change, do you, Bill? Don't you have anything to say to me? I'm outta here. Go tuck yourself, Bill. What are you staring at?How long will this take? How would we cut off the lysine? But would we get the phones back? Wait a minute. What exactly does this mean? Two million - - great. That would help. Oh good, that'll take no time. How many lines of code are there? What one? Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up? Oh, you know, if it's alright, I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding and finish with the trike. Is that okay? Yours was fully illustrated, honey. Alan? Where are we going? You see something? The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it? You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous. You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves. Violently, if necessary. Paleo-DNA? From what source? Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?! I'll catch up with you. You can go with the others. There's only one way to be positive. I need to see some droppings. I have to see the dinosaur's droppings. Are you sure? That's pharmacological. From local plant life. These are dilated. Take a look. Six weeks? Okay, I'm following the tubing. I'm going down a passage way. How long does this stuff go for? Could you guys talk a little bit to me? Mr. Arnold? He's not answering me. Okay I'm on the grating. Look. Why? John.... Control?! You never had control! I was overwhelmed by the power of this place. So I made a mistake too. I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now. You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up. The only thing that matters now are the people we love. Alan, Lex, and Tim. And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know? John, John. John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion. And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here. That's the illusion. But you can't think through this one. You have to feel it. Carousel. Malcolm's okay for now. I gave him a shot of morphine. Alan, these aren't bones anymore. Oh my God. Oh my God. I have samples all over the kitchen. Did I say jerk? I can't get it! I can't get it unless I move! You can't hold it by yourself! Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors. I'll just finish. Yeah, I want to finish. And when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too. That's what makes her sick. Good work Tim. - - barfs them up - - - - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - - - - like birds. What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - - - - the undigested state of the berries because it's - - Yeah, I know. Constantly sick. I know. It's my favorite. Oh, shit. Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?! So what are you thinking? We were right! You've got a T-rex!? He's got a T-rex! A T-rex! He said he's- - They were wrong. Case closed. This thing doesn't live in a swamp to support it's body weight for God's sake! The - - agility. You're right! Why would they care what we think? Small versions of adults, honey. Sattler. Okay, who's the jerk? It frustrates me so much that I love you, that I need to strangle you right now! Anything else, you old fossil? The what? Alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies don't smell. Oh my god, they do not! They don't smell. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing. What's so wrong with kids? You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him. Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments. Velociraptor? A drought. The lake was shrinking - - If they died together, they lived together. Suggests some kind of social order. They died together? Like hell it is! Why not? I can see the shed from here! We can make it if we run! Oh my God. Aw, God. Okay, I'm on channel two. We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back. You just take me through this step by step. I'm on channel two. Okay. I can't wait anymore. Something went wrong. I'm going to go get the power back on. What's that? Alan?! Do you see anything? Alan! The other car! No, no, no! The fences are electrified, right? - - shut up. Seven days?! Seven days?! Oh, great. Oh good - - clever. Faster! Shit, shit, shit, faster! Faster, faster! Can we chance moving him? Yeah. Alan? Alan? Unpredictability.... Oh, imperfections? Alan, listen to this. Uh - - thumb! The same way. I'm still not clear on Chaos. Dinosaur eats man. Woman inherits the Earth. Anti-nature. When people try to control things that it's out of their power - - And scary. I get ah - - No.Phone security systems, everything works. You ask for it, we got it! Yes. Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant! You're gonna get electrocuted electrified! Timmy! Do as he says! Timmy! Do as Dr. Grant says, quick! Do as he says! The power's coming back, Timmy! Timmy! The power is coming down, quick! Let's go! Please! What's that? I like cows. Go away! All night? What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep? What are you gonna do now if you don't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more? Dorkatops! Oh, I hate the other kind. Hear that? Are you hearing this? Alright. It's safe. It's safe? Liar! You said you wouldn't leave! He left us! He left us! Dad - - Dad - - He's knocked out! He's knocked out! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! Daddy, daddy! Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant! You're gonna get electrocuted electrified! The power's coming back! Jump, Timmy! It's too late! That's not funny. What? I'm a hacker! They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals. And these are herbivores. No, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop! Stop! Stop! Don't let the monsters come over here! They don't bother me. Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong? I don't know! I'm sorry! I don't know, I don't know. I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - - What's going to happen to the goat? He's going to eat the goat?! We love the presents. We miss you.The donor. Maybe he's alive inside the game. Maybe he's not dead. Dead? But how can it change every time? How do you do that? What's the question mark? We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game... We're having some problems with ARCADE... There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow... Neither are we. Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford. It's the game, ARCADE. How'd you know it was us? But you always lie, so you didn't come from there. That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth. Liar. Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right? Did you play ARCADE last night? Everybody's sick, huh? It's fifteen after. We always meet here, you know that. Has anyone seen Greg? He thinks I'm "sublimating". I just thought of something. If we came back from the game... ...what if ARCADE did too? Never been on a snowboard. There never is. One of them, anyway... Did you see it? The Screamer? We don't have a choice! Screamer. Look around... Our time's up. Check your read-out. There... Yeah, that's what worries me. The clock's already ticking. The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level. Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then... You've got the schematics, check. Got it. Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances. One. In case... You feel it? It's different this time. I already have a boyfriend, Nick. What? And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?! Yes I am... Yes it does. Don't you see? We have to play by the rules. That's what it wants. Put in a quarter. What are you looking for? You didn't hear me? Dante's Inferno. You got the schematics? I can't believe you made it! What are you going to do? No I'm not... Virgin sacrifices? I was afraid you'd say that. And beat it at it's own game. They made ARCADE. It's still a game, right? It thinks like a game. Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?. SLIP-STREAM. Then where do we go?! The Police, then... Anywhere. We have to stop it from getting out. ...but then it hits the relay stations... Like the fractals? Nick, what is it. What? Where do we go? We can't... Change the channel! Let's go around back. This is like a movie or something. I mean, am I paranoid or what? Laurie's. She thought Benz was at school. If they're sick, great. But let's make sure. Come on, Nick. We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone... Sure. Because I didn't know where else to go. All of them? Something's happened to them. Call the others. Laurie, Benz... It turned itself back on, Nick. See, men always do this. "Quiet down, honey. Chill out. Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick! I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!! So how did it know my name, then? It is. No, wait. Just listen. I hooked it up earlier tonight, and it said my name. As soon as I turned it on, Nick. It said my name. How could it know? And then, I asked it where Greg was, and it said, "In here". No. Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway... I think the game's alive somehow. Turn if off! Can you turn off the game? Greg never came home. A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him. Funny. I'm coming over. No, in person. Now. I have to talk to you. Listen to me! Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it. Nick... Hello? But he was playing the game. I mean, you saw him... Yeah... So where is he? Well, it's a long story... Go for it. And then keep on driving? I'm okay. I know. Oh God...oh god... In this world, wrong is right! Which way? Then we'll go home. Thought so. How did you get here? Did you play the game?! I'm thinking! Think! I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which? The liar...think! Wait! No! That's not it! What did he do to you? Is...is that where we are? Did I die? Yes...but...how did you... But I don't understand... Mom? You're alive...Not yet, honey... I love you, Alex. I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? I miss you so much, Alex. I want so much to be with you... Of course I am.Experiments? When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him. He stayed a long time. Can't you make other creations? But I have to go out. Something's happening out there. I'm not hungry. What's wrong? I spent all morning on that soup. I thought you liked Worm's Wart. No. But why? It's your lunch. There isn't much there in the first place. Nothing. W-w-what are you talking about? Coming... Just me, I suppose... I'm restless. I can't help it. That's not true. It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just... I know. I can't help it. I'm grown up now. I have to leave some time. I know. Yes. Yes. Yes. No!Thank you. Answer the question, please. Do you have any lesions on your face at this time? And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you. You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct? Really? You could have infected him, isn't that right? Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?! As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right? Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks? Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk? While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct? Do you need a break? You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85? But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985? Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity? When? Approximately what year did this event take place? Do men have sex with each other in that theater? Gay pornographic movies? What kind of movies do they show there? Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street? In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life? Do you take risks? You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct? Thank you. Were you recently promoted? Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler? Objection. We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury. I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater? Objection! Objection! Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...Now that you mention it... Yeah. Do I have a case? Why should I? Right.You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time. You take the microwave? How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way. You don't love me, is that it? Is there somebody else? I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information. But it's on the water. Boats. All anyone talks about is the wind. Is it up, is it down. I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind. Boats. You go out in them. You come back in them. I hate them. I hate boats. Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home. Look! Oh! You okay? Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you. I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here. I told you. Nothing -- Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just... I don't know what to say about it, Walter. It was a form of temporary insanity. But I had to tell you about it because -- Walter, there's something I have to tell you -- It's so beautiful. It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from. You see what I mean. There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them. Surprises are highly overrated. Walter. I do. Don't hate me but I love this pattern. Well, I did. And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect. About forever. I am. I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous. It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know? You go. And then I'll see you in New York -- Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long. I know. It makes no sense at all. Thank God my life is in place. Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her. She was completely hysterical. Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth. I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again. Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs. I don't think so. It's delicious, trust me. We will? The Symphony? Okay. I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni. Go for a walk in Central Park -- Walter, I'd love to -- Happy New Year. Don't be silly. I'll just be ten minutes behind you. How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident. Even when you were young? I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter? They loved you. I told you they would love you and they did. Is that all right with you? If he eats one tiny piece of a nut -- He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it -- They're going to love you. I hope he doesn't get out his slides. -- who is the most competitive woman in the world -- -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't -- -- who's married to -- I hate it. I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. This is right. This is real. Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts. Please don't tell anyone about what happened. "Sleepless in Seattle" is history. We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night. No, I'm not. It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho. I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me. Made for each other. "Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle." Becky? Well, it's the same woman. And he was crazy about her. What is this? This is from Seattle. I saw her. She looked just like this -- It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times. I'm so stupid. From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk. He said hello. That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing. You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you? Good night. Thank you. I love you. Is this crazy? Becky? That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am. I couldn't do it. How did I get here? Definitely. I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows. What? Hello. I always wondered about that too. I know. Listen to this, I love this part -- And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him? No. That's impossible. A guy can't -- You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet. Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in. "I want to meet you..." I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him? I should say something in this about magic. I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system. I know that. You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio. On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind." "I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" -- "Dear Sleepless and Son..." They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was... Not. Actually, he sounded nice. That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep. Nothing's with me. What was what? There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true -- About what? No. Not remotely. I just want to find out about him. I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him. No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice -- No, I know that part -- She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus. I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister... That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high- five? I want my money. I know. I know. Howard. Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this? Yes. Come on, Jonah -- How am I going to explain this to Walter? This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind -- Perfect. Sandbag the father. Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off. I know, I know. I do not want to move to Seattle. But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you? I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle. But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated? I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and -- I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married? It's a sign. Like... clockwork. Mom, we already... Mom! Magic. What? What? It wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence. Oh, please. Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental. It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life. It's silly, really. I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white. You'll love them. We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning. I know. He's wonderful, isn't he? Granny's dress. Oh, Mom. It's probably just the flowers -- Walter and I are engaged! It's me? Shhhh -- Hi. Hello. Magic. Sure you do.You don't believe in signs. So you'll get married in a new dress. Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working? Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while -- I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it? One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it -- Magic. It was magic. You know. I was in Atlantic City with my family. Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier. I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care. And then he held my hand. I was scared. All sorts of thing were going through my head. But after a while I forgot about them. At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his. And I knew. Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna? Destiny takes a hand. How amazing. How did it happen? Are his folks nice? I notice these things are back in fashion. Oh, honey. He's a lovely man, Annie. The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them -- We'll move them -- Everybody! Annie has an announcement --I love the symphony. What are your plans in New York? You're going to miss the train. What about the letter? So he can't write. Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble. M.F.E.O.? So I mailed your letter. This is a photo of hair. You don't know who she was, Annie -- It's a sign -- But he saw you, right? I love that dream. You were standing in the middle of the street? I love you, too. No. That's the weirdest part about it. What? Okay. Good. Goodbye. You told a lie and got on a plane. Did you talk to him? You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it. The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on. Turn on your radio! Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it? Men never get this movie. Plus he fell in love with a temp. Yes. Can too. He lost all the weight... there. You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- "On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day." Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick. What? Right. You are. You're losing your mind. What about Walter? And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers. It sounds like the name of a mattress store -- ... movie. That's your problem. You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie. Read it to me. You're a basket case. Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it. And now 2,000 women want his number. The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick. "Sleepless in Seattle"? What's with you? What was that about up there? It's not true, but it feels true. Whatever it is. You should write something about this.Why not? What was it that made you know? What are you going to do, Sam? Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more? We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, your response, to the things we've been discussing. The number to call is... And I don't want to invade your privacy -- Why not? Have you had any relationship since? Good. How long ago did your wife die? I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better. Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America. I'm not selling anything. Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife. Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America. I have no doubt that you're a good dad. You can tell a lot from a person's voice. But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud. Fair enough. I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him. Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly. Is he home right now? You want me to talk to him? Why not? And you're worried about him. I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah. Where's your mom? You don't like the one he was now? Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah? No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?I don't understand. My man? You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men. Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man? You're Just a dirty little fixer. Not now. I don't have time. Absolutely nothing. Maybe even my destiny. Oh, so that's it... A peace officer... Impressive man The man dealing faro. Who is he? Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich. Wyatt! My God... I have to go. I forgave you the moment you said it. Wyatt...

So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude. Always? I hate Sadie. And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie. And I don't even know your full name. I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall. You know this is adultery. You Burn in hell for that. I know, me too. What should we do About it? What's wrong? Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live. I'm a woman, I like men. If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady. At least I'm honest. Well he's handsome and he's Charming. He's all right. For Now. Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten. I can't help it. I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring. See? You're laughing again. But That's what I want. Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun. Forever. That's my idea Of heaven. Need someone to share It with, though. Room service. Just doesn't, that's all. Doesn't suit you. Just answer. Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life? Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored. That blonde Woman, is that your wife? You're a little touchy about it. Yes, but how often? Tell me, are You happy? Wouldn't you? You're laughing! I Was sure you never laughed. Fun though, wasn't it? That was lovely! I have a better idea, let's run It out of them! Oh... Now she's starting. How do they know? What is it? Wyatt Earp, I know. I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet. This is fortuitous. That Means lucky.Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you? Right out loud so I can hear? Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt? Will you do that? You know nothing. What you don't Know would fill a book. Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most. You're never Yourself, you never relax. Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself. Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh. But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt. I get so cold. What's between you and that Jew woman? Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night. I need it. Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again. Wyatt, what're you talkin' about? Sure I'm sure. What is this? I don't know. I'm all right. I know what I'm doing. Where have You been? Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well. No, no, I don't want to keep you. Oh, all right. No, stay. Please stay with me. You get lonely? Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound. I think I'll just lie down awhile Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face. This is great, we got cable. That was so good I am gonna have another. You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"? He wants to speak with you. Nope. Yes. Gotten your mail yet? What letter? Did you get the letter? He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow. I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too. Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley. It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey. I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence. It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think? Cancoon. You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch. What? How come? Really? I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? Nope. I'm not really a wine gal. ... was so romantic. I think what you did... I think what you did was... Is this a joke? Was it him or you? You don't know him - No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. Why? What? Where you goin', honey? No no no no no no no no no... Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley? Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today? How do you do, Mr. Worley? I do. I don't believe so. You better not be fucking teasing me. Yes. What? At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date. Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary. Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day. He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. My pimp. It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself." I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day. Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you. I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know. I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place. I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl. Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there. You didn't do nothing. So he really loved her? You mean she got a bad batch? She OD'd, didn't she? I love Janis. You're not stupid. Just wrong. What would make you think that? At the movies? Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis. Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then? God, Spiderman looks different. What's that? I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books. You bet. How much is that worth? Do you get paid a lot? That's a long time. How long have you worked here? Wow. What a swell place to work. Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you. Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out. I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later. I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians. Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie. Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel". Very much. Now, where were we? Yes, I would. Burt Reynolds. I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black. Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet. I don't remember. Ask me them again. One by one. What do you want to know? There's nothing to tell. How 'bout me what? Would you like to get some pie? Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie? I suppose you gotta get up early, huh? What time is it? Sure. Why not? I took a cab. That's my real name, really. I got proof. See. Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya. If that was the R, I'd love to see the X. Sonny kicks ass. Great movie. Action-packed! I thought Sonny was the good guy. Want some Goobers? The oriental. What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick. I'm the clumsiest person in the world. Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK? ... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go. Bye-bye. He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over. Get it. Ya looked through it? The letter he sent. Don't eat anything. Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it. Oh, hush up. Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon. It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open. I didn't get any chicken. The forager's back. Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy. I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
