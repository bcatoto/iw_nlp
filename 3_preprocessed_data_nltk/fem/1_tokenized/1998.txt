doesnt approve of my lifestyle and needless to say i dont approve of his still i hardly wish to make my fathers embezzlement a police matter so im proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to little lebowski urban achievers yes and proud we are of all of them i asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this abduction but i tell you it is preposterous this compulsive dont be fatuous jeffrey little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career lord you can imagine where it goes from here take a look at this sir yes mr lebowski these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these i like it too its a male myth about feminists that we hate sex it can be a natural zesty enterprise but unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy youre not interested in sex sex the physical act of love coitus do you like it do you like sex mr lebowski yes i know about it and i know that you acted as courier and let me tell you something the whole thing stinks to high heaven thank you yes they dont like hearing it and find it difficult to say whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his dick or his rod or his johnson in a sense yes elfranco my robe my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal which bothers some men the word itself makes some men uncomfortable vaginai never imagined id be so happy to see the sun rise its over isnt it yes you will the human side of you is stronger i know it is its the only way you know that well never get out of here alive if you dont i know take some of my blood im not leaving without you it wont work on you is it bad i dont know i woke up just before you did are you all right you make it sound like im already dead im just tired thats all weve been up all night some its been slow my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart you care about him dont you is he sick i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment blade if youre not human then why do you bleed like us ive seen vampire blood you dont have it running through your veins those arent real memories no one has that kind of recall its dark in here what am i injecting you with youre hurt isnt this all a little hightech i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins what is this place like what so many of them i still cant believe theyre real how can you tell you let him go an hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one didnt even talk i know this place its a blood bank graffiti what are you looking at you dont know that look if what you say is true if theres a chance i could turn into one of them then ive got no choice do i i have to work with you i need to learn everything i can about them its the only way ill be able to find a cure for myself you cant do this hes human its murder what are you doing and thats a good thing why in gods name would anyone want to work for them but hes a policeman but he couldve you used me as bait how did you know thats ridiculous no ones that powerful i can go to the police i have blood samples back at the hospital i can show them i cant just leave i have a life here a career and you honestly expect me to believe all this what happens then why youre joking im sorry i but then i remember what an asshole you were and im snapped back to reality sometimes what you havent started in on the internal organs five minutes not a second more and i dont want to hear a word about us i thought you promised to give me some distance curtis its three in the morning im really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes the red blood cells are biconvex which is theoretically impossible theyre hypochromic theres virtually no hemoglobin in them look at the pmns theyre binucleated they should be mononucleated i dont know look at this blood smear this isnt human blood get away from him blade youre a monster but you use blood banks theres no need for any of this your condition can be treated whistler and i were working on a cure when you lamagra what happens then how many of you are there what happened to the power on me yes on blade im not so sure the problem is blade didnt contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did he was born with it the irony is i could probably cure every vampire but him with a retrovirus its injected into the bone marrow cells it causes the hosts dna to mutate theyve been using them to treat sicklecell anemia basically youd have to rewrite the victims dna alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin then vampirism is a genetic defect just like hemolytic anemia all right lets start with the basics why do vampires need to drink blood ill take my chances and now youre using blade to exact your revenge how did you escape he killed them why do you hunt them no offense whistler but youre not exactly working with state of the art equipment here you might have missed something what happens if he doesnt take the serum why didnt you tell me the truth about him whistler youve been listening in the whole time so thats it you guys just patch me up and send me on my way so what do you use then a stake who are you people what yes sir everything wont say says he must talk to you why yes im sorry it seems fine yes sir anything wrong you wont regret this sir ive taken the liberty and had inspector thompsons office searched as i believe you instructed all clear now sir they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories poor man the chiefinspector thought you might need a hand im

honestly dont know how i would have handled all this if i were you thats not true what oh baby when tonight started what what did you say well then i do apologize but what im most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what shes feeling who cant admit when shes wrong and who cant forgive when shes not listen if if theres a part of you as parent that that takes pride in your child that you can look at them and see something youve accomplished as well if thats wrong then im sorry but it wasnt my intention i dont push for me i do it for you so you dont waste half your life feeling like you dont know where you belong i dont deserve that i have never looked at you as a disappointment if im on your back to do better if i push you to try harder its because i want you to be the best you can be what how can you im sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much but i happen to value having someone to talk to especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say its wrong and no matter what i do its wrong im sorry im such a disappointment to you stop it why cant i talk to you look i just wanted to say i think its great

right about telling liz to put him down have you decided about pilgrim grace i put it on the table near your i brought it to you in the hospital its still early whats your next class you are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself youre going to get up and youre going to figure this out grace listen to me your body is just healing you have to give the rest of you time as well oh well what are you going to do you have to go to school honey i mean what oh honey what happened dadll pick you up today all right why dont you go lie down liz is taking care of him the doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can uh yes sure david what the hell does that mean how much more do i have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me oh come on this is such bullshit the work is getting done david lucky keeps me on top of everything exactly david he signed an agreement that he wouldnt talk to the press and hes libeled me by saying i faked the figures youre not going soft on me are you yes were suing everyone working overtime just for you david where to i have so much to tell you mmm i made good time pilgrims in the back i found a new stable but they cant take him until tomorrow what do you mean hi um there doesnt seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for tubab who might to have a place for me

stay in the city or go up to connecticut lets not talk about that now no its okay believe me there were plenty of times i didnt know what the hell was right you dont have to explain you have every right to come youre allergic to hay oh i didnt look at my faxes today we left before sunrise about what fine actually today was a good day you should have seen her everything all right oh robert im sorry we were so tired from the branding grace barely made it to her bed and i didnt have the energy to take my clothes off night i know we miss you too okay you know i just asked that myself tonight he doesnt know yeah but nothing i cant handle lucy tells me she thinks gottchalkss plotting but what else is new well its good that youre there yeah she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch which is why i said yes to this move but whenever its just the two of us i dont know anyway whats happening with the delco lawsuit no thats not what i said im not a dictator if you feel you should come then come just do whatever you think is right she will if you think she should robert were losing her were losing her i dont care what the doctors say the truth is they dont know anymore than we do less when it comes to grace this may not sound sensible or logical but nobodys suggesting anything better i cant explain it robert i just have this feeling this annoying bloody feeling that if if somehow pilgrim can be made all right then so can grace i just know it i dont care what he says we have to do something robert i cant sit here and trust everythings going to work out just by pretending it will i cant say hes been all that effective with her why im in charge i went back very soon after the accident they didnt expect me for a couple of months ill just take that time now i can still oversee things from montana take my fax my computer hell be sedated i know horses robert im the one who taught grace how to ride im not asking you to ill do it no i was just researching calm down ive called liz they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim i thought wed stay at motels along the way robert grace isnt adjusting to school and she cant sit in this apartment all day i think it would be good for her he did but i think i can change his mind about us going someplace warm someplace gracell have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses no yeah why did you go how was the dinner helping all the time running to her every time she trips or falls anticipating her all the time youve got to stop doing that do you do you really aw thats so sweet you can hardly get your arms around me how depressing youre so early sing it to me frankie oh right ill call him okay were very lucky no ill go you stay in case she wakes up i should go get some of her things what did he say tch what are you robert you leave it up these people that bags almost empty what about grace yeah bye i dont know well figure it out im sorry about last night i shouldnt have brought it up over the phone sure whats grace up to i should be in by two hi its me what choice its so cruel absolutely i made enough for an army well did you ever think about hiring a business manager oh i dont know you know thats interesting i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak i couldnt taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender i didnt know there was that big a difference between cows ive never been on a cow farm before i must say the bulls seem to have the best time of it just laying around the fields all day until theyre asked to do their work you too diane promise its just one night if i get uncomfortable ill go over to hanks i already know the way and its not like i have a job i have to rush home for between you and me i could use the time alone oh how sweet no no ill go just give me a list is there anything you need im going foodshopping i dont think anybody can make tom do anything he didnt want what sounds like something tom would say franks a good man did you always know this was the life you wanted delayed shock or maybe not i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or go to another magazine someplace just not sure if i want to no its more like a leave of ha ha ha yeah they fired me well i have more than a few days ha ha i uh im sort of not an editor anymore right now first time ive said it out loud you and frank ever take a vacation but uh egypt is well its like nothing else its like going back in time i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age centuries ago walking over that same ground was wondering about or if they had the same problems as me and i felt connected to to time itself almost ha i never realized how hard it was to describe oh god i think it was the fourth or fifth time id been there so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was i was there for that shot actually well i know i should reject that offer but im not going to thank you youre all doing too much i got a little confused though the ranch ellen was talking about thats not this one she calls him tommy where does this go diane its fine comfortable i still cant get used to how dark it gets around here though when we leave the ranch i always hold my breath until i can see the motel oh uh thank you no we dont want to impose uh no were going to dinner is this the way to the pasture would you mind if i did id like to talk to him of course not maybe we should give him another sedative and i can say the same thing about my daughter but she is suffering can you solve that problem i cant deal with this now liz if you need a yes or no right now then no dont do it not until i know grace is all right now please just do what you can okay please i just dont know right now do whatever you can and when grace is see what you can do for him liz listen the doctors here and i just cant uh talk now so well of course right wait uh i i dont understand start again hes alive her leg was shattered so they had to uh remove it she had some bleeding but its under controlgood luck to you annie promise now are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself there are plenty of people round here who do that sort of thing i think im going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave just might be his first broken heart well i am going to go after lunch hes a good man tom is hes got a gift come from heaven above i swear but hes still a man and a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake and still make him think hes on dry land annie im not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so lets just say what it is when you first came here i didnt like you and i was worried tom means a lot to me and this family dont go looking here for whatever you looking for dont make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time yes it does they dont come better but i dont deny there are times i wonder about things i wont have maybe one day ill get to see egypt maybe not but i know if you try too many different lives you can wind up with no life at all i fell in love after that i never thought about being anything but a ranchers wife i never saw it like i was losing some other life just felt like i was gaining one i know thats not a popular opinion nowadays and i aint saying its the right one we all have to find the life meant for us guess you dont have to figure it out until you go home you dont seem to upset they fired you must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work huh soon were going to branson missouri to see my cousin emma married frank loves in there id love to go there one time what was it like i was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the pyramids were you ever in egypt no reason you should no reason you should ill help you with the coffee oh its

when he was two years old he ran off they found him in the barn sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise

business howd you get this number yes get your hands up and turn around now i mean romantically i never thought it made sense though the way they got together so quick with robert redford when he was young you have to be kidding youd probably tell me nothing bleeding on a country road peter finch inetworki yeah she was good faye dunaway it was may 1934 near gibsland louisiana they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving bonnie was eating a sandwich i dont recall his hat but ive seen pictures of him lying dead shot by texas rangers did you know he didnt have his shoes on you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow you know this isnt gon na end well these things never do sure uhhuh you were married all those falls im surprised you had time what do you want me to do scream i dont think it would help much im just gon na sit back take it easy and wait for you to screw up of course i am i dont have to i dont rob banks i know the difference you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary ive delivered people there so basically youve spent half your life in prison it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor thats funny how many was that why are you famous so whats your name itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway buddy thats his given name must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this you wouldnt have time anyway we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me i believe it youve ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me in my bag in the car for your breath you could use it squirt some in your mouth if i could have a little more room im a federal marshal and youre under arrest both of you guys if i didnt know you glenn by tomorrow youd be in jail or dead look at it that way go on but listen glenn if youre lying to me you want to get out of here run itll warm you up gee i wonder why not but you say he hasnt shown up you think he backed out whys that and is foley a part of this ripley you mean the wall street guy but i thought the whole thing was your idea whats going on glenn for the car for aiding and abetting a prison escape and conspiring to do whatever you came here for glenn i know your life history who your friends are where youve been and now it looks like where youre going put your hands on the wheel the two guys you were with that one that isnt maurice miller is it ive seen snoopys mug shot and that didnt look like him youre not another one of those days huh nothing seems to go right glenn are you trying to steal this car glenn take the exit take the next exit wait ihavei you helped him glenn at this point technically i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive so you still have a choice you can help him and risk going down again get cuffed and shackled hope to god you pull a reasonable judge not some hardon or if you want to play it another way look i can understand if you and foley are close foleys not going to make it and if he goes down glenn you go with him do we have a gun in the car last fall i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse twice youre glenn michaels i never forget anyone ive cuffed and shackled no thats not what im thinking you dont remember me do you glenn ill send it to you at glades oh hows it going he took the week off so

problems my problems not yours not his mine promise what norman tell me but i have to norman its not me beth its not me it cant be im not doing anything just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle im not scaring you am i norman i hope im not frightening you the last thing i want to do is frighten you you feel okay dont you when you were in that sub and that squid was attacking you are you sure it was the squid that was attacking do you know i cant get beth on the radio im in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean all alone surrounded by all this water was it really the squid that was attacking you norman or was it something else one of your fears you never really saw what it was did you no it isnt your name is norman but your younger brother what was his name the one who was stung when you were younger the one that died the one you couldnt save what was his name mommy were going out to the ocean to go swimming but i dont want to go swimming norman im scared cmon harry itll be fine itll be fun you heartless fuck thats why youre so scared of the water isnt it is it you remember before you picked him up when you looked up at the sphere you remember that when the sphere opened thats right but you cant remember going inside can you no of course not harry couldnt either could he like everythings on the tip of my tongue he said you dont remember you did but im sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry dont you you remember that am i or am i making so much sense that youre going insane did i or was that you when you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened didnt you terrified like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor you did that norman one lonely terrifying sea snake and the snakes you want to know about the snakes you saw one outside earlier didnt you when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified am i lying are you sure are you absolutely sure im lying then explain to me about the jellyfish earlier why did we see jellyfish harry doesnt fear jellyfish you do theyre your fear arent they cmon what yes someone did but it wasnt me norman it was you you manifested the snakes you think i manifested the snakes no he cant no he isnt same reason i put explosives around the habitat for defense for the power to protect myself whats the phrase keeping up with the joneses if i was then i wouldve had to have gone in the sphere wouldnt i dont you you tell me am i afraid of them not during the day sea snakes are diurnal when the suns out they dont bite fortunately for you i had on my watch this is quite good snakes what do you mean exactly i did do that didnt i you dont think i put something in it do you its getting cold are you whats wrong norman oh yes my watch i almost forgot what was that i couldnt hear you hows harry what do you mean different in the sub resetting the timer why what is it norman youre not sorry youre scared youre a psychologist norman you pride yourself on knowing when someones lying to you not telling you the truth and now youre scared because youre not sure you can tell anymore for what only lab rats here you ever given an injection before look its either him or us norman another attack and we go down with this place to be on the safe side i mean its an idea what if it takes 20 minutes norman what if it takes an hour and he can fight it off we cant afford that how fast does it take effect ill just boost the doses how long does it last used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride causes sleep its a soporific how do you spell it antibiotic antihistamine for bites and may also cause bizarre halucinations tranquilizer causes drowsiness nothing about drowsiness a synthetic opium analogue ulcers its for motion sickness something for burns why would harry go back to using a code and thats the part of harry thats being manifested his dream you cant control your dreams and you cant control your fears can you but why is he doing it which i told barnes was attacking how can the sphere do that but how you think in the sphere what do you mean a part of harry what manifested squids what damn it norman hes lying dont you get it there is something seriously fucked up going on here and hes causing it why cant you believe me you think its me you think im saying there was a conversation when there wasnt damn it norman i swear i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up you dont believe me no it wasnt i swear none of this was here none of it you think he hid it earlier he mustve hid it none of this was here before wait a second that wasnt in there before the refridgerator fixing it but i fixed whered you get all that whats harry doing with your suit in there you get it straightened out deserts you harry said hed take over for me getting food we were out of food whats wrong you sound mad what do you mean im in the ship still clear you cant counters at 10 minutes you dont have time yes norman i did youre just nervous whats the matter still clear the subs a 100 feet in front of you you see it you press a button norman its not brain surgery here go ahead you only have 15 minutes to reset it go on norman you dont trust me i fixed your suit i dont trust harry to do it you should know how it works just in case maybe you should go to the sub get the helium out of our bloodstream we go to the surface now wed pop like a soda bottle we cant the storm the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here and we have four days of decompression when we get up top you me and harry hes asleep its also our only way out of here it holds three people and theres only three of us left now dont bother me norman i have to reset the sub no i should stay calm like you say right norman stay calm yeah okay sure norman you bastard you did didnt you you told him about me you said something to him didnt you dont tell me to calm down hes not just a navy captain he works for the fucking pentagon in edmunds things although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft signed barnes usn fuck you norman its right here so who was barnes talking to at the last minute nobody yeah he told you think what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose he was on the phone except that cable is a thousand feet long norman they wouldve broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out he lied to us he left us down here eggs norman she was crushed feel her skin its like sandpaper i didnt do anything wrong i didnt mean nobody said norman what why are you looking at me like that what wait dont why are you i mean im not i wasnt absolutely sure if they what why yeah why what they have six tentacles a new species and the squid too they had no stomach normally id say no everythings quiet now no ships no divers no electricity makes sense but whats curious is these arent normal jellyfish what about you what happened to you my gosh norman a bad one it was the only book in there norman come here look at this the library it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas norman good theory ted such a gentlemen when youre scared shitless youre next norman isnt there a psychological term for that dr johnson just keep your mouth shut alright this could mean everything to our careers you know that dont jeopardize this well lets pray thats the only mistake you made have you said anything to barnes about this well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here in the ocean 70 percent of the earths surface is water norman thats first grade geography what do you expect for them to bring it up here to the spacecraft to investigate because when we get down there do yourself a favor norman are you listening dont tell anyone what you just told me thats quite a secret ive read it twice norman its brilliant i love secrets who says its a he norman wheres norman im a woman i dont theorize i only deal with facts i dont

through another nightwell were fbi agents i think you better tell us youre not supposed to talk about it who told you that do you live around here no they dont what is it you find incredible agent mulder i hope to were working to develop this evidence nothing completely conclusive yes i know that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen so their deaths and the reason for them wouldnt have to be explained yes i apologize for making you wait ive brought some new evidence with me i cant go any farther where are we cold ive got no allergy something this mulder i think i think you should call an ambulance no its my pulse feels thready and ive got a funny taste in the back of my throat somethings wrong im having lancinating pain my chest my motor functions are being affected im i think something stung me why was i assigned to you to debunk your work to reign you in to shut you down you dont mulder youve never needed me ive only held you back ive got to go im contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers i have i did its done youre on the verge mulder please dont do this to me i can mulder i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew i already gave skinner my letter of resignation salt lake city utah transfer effective immediately whered they go what are you doing yeah i hear the humming like electricity high voltage maybe cool in here temperatures being regulated any thoughts on why anybodyd be growing corn in the middle of the desert this is weird mulder what do you think it is pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope only to find myself standing right where i am right now at another dead end i dont believe this i dont fucking believe this yknow ive been here ive been here one too many times with you mulder mulder what do you mean by haul what are you not telling me here they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks they dont haul viruses in tanker trucks of what exactly ive got to be in washington dc in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas chasing phantom tanker trucks this is great this is fitting i dont know why i think they went right weve got two choices one of them is wrong about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction thats the first question to answer if were going to find them i dont know mulder all the equipment is brand new it looks pretty green for this climate no it didnt show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests the bone was porous as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it i dont see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite not even a sewer or a storm drain he didnt mention a park that i dont know but if its through simple contact of blood to blood and if it doesnt respond to conventional treatments it could be a serious health threat something i couldnt show to anyone else not without more information and not without causing the kind of attention id just as soon avoid right now the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat ive never seen before what it did to them it did extremely fast and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain it survives very nicely outside the body i wasnt planning on it particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen mulder i cant im already way past the point of common sense here ive got a hearing tomorrow mulder i dont know evidence of a massive infection i cant really talk right now mulder this is going to take some time and somebodys going to figure out soon enough were not even supposed to be here im in serious violation of medical ethics youre saying the bombing was a coverup of what you knew this man didnt die at the bomb site before we got here i dont know what killed this man im not sure if anybody else could claim to either and theres been no autopsy performed theres no y incision here no internal exam theres some kind of cellular breakdown its completely edematous and youre looking for this is one of the firemen who died in dallas mulder what are you doing go home mulder its late i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting is that before or after you got the idea to come here are you drunk mulder no theres really no reason left for me to stay anymore maybe you should ask yourself if your hearts still in it too theyre not doing this mulder i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau i felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself but it hasnt turned out that way and now if i were to be transferred to omaha or wichita or some field office where im sure i could rise it just doesnt hold the interest for me it once did not after what ive seen and done because they wanted me to invalidate your work your investigations into the paranormal but i think this goes deeper than that i think you must have an idea they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment they have divided us mulder theyre splitting us up all i told them was the truth mulder get in the car mulder move away from the door were coming through it hang on im gon na get you out of there mulder tell me this is a joke nice try mulder where are you mulder scully something sweet i just did youre buying i saw your face mulder there was a moment of panic oh yeah had you big time had you now what youve got to quit looking for what isnt there theyve closed the xfiles theres procedure to be followed here protocol i know youre bored in this assignment but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now jesus mulder mulder mulder when a terrorist bomb threat is called in the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror if youd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device if we dont act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it lives could be lost i know that but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street ive just climbed twelve floors im hot and thirsty and im wondering to be honest what im doing here no i havent im on the roof mulder its me tomorrow we are getting married tomorrow so wheres that leave us well oh what does that mean money my god do you love me do you love me you put him down or dont bother coming back if you dont tie up all the loose ends itll never be over you and moore move the bodies and bury boyd with them in fact put moore in the ground too move the bodies the only proof is those bodies like how what

then youre not her grandmother and the child was there ever any kind of investigation she still work there actually i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette i was wondering if i could ask

ask you something here when you say it hurt was this the first time a man was inside you was there penetration did he put himself inside you i understand take your time i know you do how are you kelly would you like to take a break for a minute suzie you could tell me where you were last night ray thinks she was murdered she didnt cone home last night we found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket suzie toller is missing werent you a little worried about her did you call anyone did you call her house to see if she got home did you call the masons and when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car id like that its homicides job now ray let em do it ill tell you something else theres more to this story than you know ray if suzie is dead i think hunter may be on the right track hes leaving the country and i dont give a shit im tired ray im going home and if the teeth arent suzies youll give this up ray you heard him we dont know that ray her grandmother said shed been threatening to run away and i found the car at the miami bus terminal wheres the body two kids couldve gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth if you want company you have someplace to be ray we dont know anything yet she could be anywhere we all have you could say that which she might have saved if she hadnt set out to destroy the mans life whered you come up with this stuff anyway eliminate the competition this ones got you working overtime hasnt it so what about the girls suzies poor but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother surely her father why you ask me lombardo had it pretty good already nice job in a beautiful setting popular an active social life hes gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what youre describing unless what maybe lombardos attorney was saving the affair for the trial lombardos settlement thats what they called it when i was in juvenile its a pretty dismal place you mean camp sixtynine the skinny brunette you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark you know what you get more bark and more bark theres no core trees not good tar anything but sucking up water and now they cant get rid of them theyve tried poisons nothing works they dont die all im saying is we let sandra van ryan push us too hard were going to wind up looking stupid we failed to mention the mower guys a drunk that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house so he cant say how long she was in there same with the kids they saw her running down the street but thats it with no physical evidence what do we have her word against his same as him they saw her come they saw her go they saw him follow hunters making it our job because sandra van ryans got a bug up his ass you know that as well as i do were gon na trash this guys life and i keep asking myself if its really necessary all im saying is i think we should go slow here back to the land of grownups what was that at that point were you able to fight him off did he come in with you so you were alone and when he arrived at your house was anyone there he dropped jimmy off first we need to tape the interview suzie no one will see it but us now when was this that mr lombardo gave you the ride why is that that bothers you you know what that will mean for lombardo i worked juvenile in dade county for three years we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks maybe a year ago the family kept it out of the papers that doesnt make him a child rapist theres something else this girls had some problems wrecked a couple of her moms cars ran away i think shes acting i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her i think maybe shes upset that he didnti know one thing he said it was when when he took himself out and was standing up he said dont worry i didnt come i cant forget that he said no little girl can ever make me come not at first he was still inside but he wasnt moving or anything he said we had this secret and that now hed be able to help me because we were close something like that i dont know its hard to remember exactly he kept
