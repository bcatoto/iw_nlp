was i didnt tell dell neither he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didnt see the point somethin terrible happened to him though six months ago it was my cousin dell done it his folks

uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in myrtle beach they still got way too much traffic there for my taste and another thing baby that government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space one hundred twenty decibels head on collision of a 54 ford pickup and a 64 chevy station wagon no survivors balls of flame and grinding metal just you uncle pooch never acted strange or different after and he never did anything else to me i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry well sure but he was supergentle you know i mean he raped me and all but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes i didnt exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didnt seem all that terrible it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich he was short but powerful with hairy arms anyway he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used we did it there on an old bed no he picked me up uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know where i was makin a jelly and banana sandwich i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter well mama was at the busy bee havin her hair dyed and i was alone in the house i said you can be too crude sometimes i dont think i care for it youre terrible crude sometimes sailor you know thats true uncle pooch wasnt really an uncle he was a business partner of my daddys and my mama never knew nothin about me and him thats for damn sure his real name was somethin kind of european like pucinski but everyone just called him pooch he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away i

misery remember ian did ride for dr cleary at the end of the last book but his horse fell jumping that fence and ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor so there couldnt have been any experimental blood transfusion that saved her life misery was buried in the ground at the end paul so youll have to start there he didnt get out of the cockadoodie car i know that mister manthey also call them serials im not stupid you know anyway my favorite was rocket man and once it was a nobrakes chapter the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned andi was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe i was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was rocket man trying to get out and here came the cliff and just before the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered but i didnt cheer i stood right up and started shouting this isnt what happened last weekhave you all got amnesiathey just cheated usthis wasnt fair thats rightwhen i was growing up in bakersfield my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays paul what youve written just isnt fair paul its not worthy of you throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me you can leave that in im

n was one of the letters in my favorite writers name dont worry about that youll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work i expect nothing less than your masterpiece yes it will be a book in my honor for saving your life and nursing you back to health ill be the first one to read it oh paul youre going to make me the envy of the whole world i know you didnt mean it when you killed

ill set everything up and look what ive got for you an electric razor so you can shave yourself now see isnt this nice yeah well its a theory heres your novril how does tuna casserole sound for dinner i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year people say it has something to do with the ozone layer what do you think as long as it does exist your mind wont ever be free i think you should light the match paul oh paul this isnt about money its about decency and purity its about gods values i know this is the only copy paul when you were twentyfour you wrote your first book and you didnt make a copy because you didnt think anybody would take it seriously but they did and ever since youve never made any copies because youre superstitiousits why you always come back to the silver creek lodge you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago so youve indicated do it then light the match paul i know this may be difficult for you but its for the best yes yes but this time i thought clearly i asked god about you and god said i delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way ill get you everything you want but you must listen first sometimes my thinking is a little muddy i accept that its why i couldnt remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in denver youre such a kidder i have a big surprise for you but first theres something you must do what are you doing on the floor its my fault if id had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened here let me help you back in i know this hurts but itll only take a

dont tell me id love to stay here and chat but im right at the end and i got ta find out what happens it boils down to respect people just dont respect the institution of marriage any more they have no sense of real commitment dont get me wrong im not against marriage per se but it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again no problem done i just kept reading them over and over i know when i finish this one and ive only got two chapters to go ill just turn right to the front page and start reading it again i dont know about you but what i did to get through it was i dove into workdays nightsnight shifts can be lonely at a hospital i did a lot of reading that was hen i first discovered misery she made me so happy she made me forget all my problems course i suppose you had a little something to do with that too for a while i thought i might go crazy yeah that and miserys childthose are the only two divine things ever in this world im on page threehundred now paul and its better than perfectits divine whats the ceiling that dago painted this farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me but when i got misery here everything changedshe just makes me smile so yes i told you i was your number one fan i thought it was time you two should meet paul say hello to my favorite beast in all the world my sow misery thank you so much i knew it i knew it wasnt true boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that i dont mean to pry but ive read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials and i said it cant be true paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that no no it isnt its oh pooh i cant think of any words would great be insulting i made you my specialityscrambled eggs a la wilkes and im on page 75 your agent said she would tell her you were okay but im afraid youll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself its like a visit from my oldest dearest friend well mines still out but the ones in town were working just fine i called that agent of yours oh paul i peeked at the very beginning what a wonderful first pagejust to read the name misery chastain the one to town is but thats about it i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon i told him who you were and what had happened he said as long as theres no infection youre not in any danger and as soon as the road to the hospital is open theyll send an ambulance for you they had it at the store paul there was a whole batch of them there as soon as i saw it i slammed my money down i got the first copy oh im sorry i didnt mean to wake you it has no nobility the swearing paul there i said it well its brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant oh its ridiculous who am i to make a criticism to someone like you nothing oh like i could do that whats it about whats your new book called youll never realize what a rare treat youve given me if you wouldnt mind it shouldnt be too much longer once the roads are open the linesll be up in no time if you give me their numbers ill keep trying them for you could i ask you a favor i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and and i wondered if maybe and youre very brilliant and you must be a good man or you could never have created such a wondrous loving creature as misery chastain like a baby all done lucky for you i did lucky for me too because now youre alive and you can write more books oh paul ive read everything of yours but the misery novels dont move nowwouldnt want to hurt this neck well the other afternoon i was on my way home and there you were leaving the lodge and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming well it wasnt any secret to me that you were staying at the silver creek seeing as how im your number one fan and all some nights id just tool on down there sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin and id try to imagine what was going on in the room of the worlds greatest writer no it wasnt a miracle at all in a way i was following you of course you will and your arm will be fine too your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly but i finally popped it back in there but what im most proud of is the work i did on those legs considering what i had around the house i dont think theres a doctor who could have done any better your legs just sing grand opera when you move dont they its not going to hurt forever paul i promise you the blizzard was

knowwhen your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine theyre not going to say ooh good paul sheldon can finally write what weve always wanted an esoteric semi autobiographical character study no no misery chastain put braces on your daughters teeth and is putting her through college bought you two houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she get you go
