youre a virgin just like that nun and im gon na rape you first ill put your uptown in the spoon then to make it more exciting im gon na add some downtown they call this thing a speedball honey but then you must know that first time shooting up then cmere i got something for you cmere you got some good blow right who why ok ok fine but do you believe in god you believe that man is the beall and endall that jesus christ was the son of god and he came to die for your sins im not talking about the fucking church fuck the church but tell me do you believe in god its horrible they burned her breasts with cigarettes christ susies not a virgin anymore i cant get over what those guys did to her i just cant who said anything about the fucking street ive got more connects than you have lieutenant its nothing this is new york man oh i forgot bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers its a good investment man she could make serious money im gon na need some bread man this aint fair im always here for you and you cant even take decent care of me my landlord is bitching like a motherfucker youre two months behind on the rent lieutenanthe wants to know who brought in the chalice are you all right honey yes yesthrough a rental agency ten days ago you know i hate to say i told you so but i warned her coming home at all hours of the night a young girl new to the city this neighborhood aint what it used to beyou couldnt find your dick in a wind storm it isnt him frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this remember eventually revenge is carefully have you tired juxtaposing the words he was with me it doesnt make sense because we dont understand it now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious what do you mean stand out a few people maybe youre reaching a bit i think sanderson should be in on this theres a reason why the killers calling him sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing but who called him today hes one of the best chess players in the world who better to play a game with you werent mad at him for picking up the phone i think your mother knows that now why dont you put the knife down put it down david i know but this isnt going to bring her back yes i do i found your file i know what happened this isnt going to help david youre mothers dead you cant undo it yeah thats what weve always thought but what if he wasnt what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here come here why did he he already did once im just nervous sorry how come the police never had a record of sanderson before this doesnt come out of nowhere there has to be a history i just cant believe it fuck off dont patronize me you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didnt warn me the same type as the girl who got killed jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath you could have been honest with me for starters we work together i have to be able to trust you oh well we wouldnt want to disturb your guests would we youre damn right im a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer nice meeting you how do you know that did he say something of course thats only because you dont know where to go you like hiking fishing sailing what do you like so are you having a good time on the island is your dad here im kathy you must be erica ive got a room at the institute i use when i stay late no he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist it was peter you dont have a shred of evidence this stinks you want to know what i think i think there have been five murders and youve got shit to go on you need to blame someone and hes the easiest choice and what if hes wrong if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you wouldve arrested him if it is someone else then hes going to kill again tonight and youre sitting here ignoring the message what does that mean what are you saying that im seeing what i want to see that im protecting a murderer what about a quarter to one as large as castles each of those grids represents almost a square mile he moves around a lot why i thought that homesearchers was a dead end well i think you have to play to his ego he thinks hes superior the more secure he feels the more chances hell take peters right captain hes got to be forced into making a mistake i know that ive seen the photos his home would be mount olympus meaning i would think its some type of clue as to where hes going to kill next yes why disguise your voice if no one knows it that would indicate hes playing out a fantasy powercontrol killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them once they become a reality though they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it but in all the research ive read on serial killers ive never heard of one moving so fast its as if the game is the catalyst for the murders not the other way around well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim but we heard him edmonds i know you lost to karpov in 82 didnt you i see youre still having problems with your openings im busy right now what do you think he did only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case youre working on whatd he do im a psychologist frank not a psychic whats this all about anyway well what i told you this was a stupid idea you cant learn anything from someone in a few minutes what are they please could you please do me a big favor in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess could you look and tell me what they are sara this is doctor sheppard i called you earlier about a book thank you im at 6397393 hi sara this is doctor sheppard i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future theres a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you you made a difference you beat him yeah ill be there later youre going to be late for your match of course not he didnt tell you either no he didnt how did you know it was carefully it could be anything maybe youre afraid of what it says why not why of course it isnt its always difficult when someone you love dies but you cant feel responsible because she had a car accident then help me to understand i want to understand youre wife died you cant feel responsible for that thats still no excuse you treat everything like a game peter i want someone i can get close to i dont know if thats possible with you im not looking for an apology peter hi because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid what but what does he mean by a fierce magazine violent for emphasis peter peter you have to admit nothing i tried again and got through theyre not delivering im going to go pick up the pizza the line was busy ill try again would you settle for pepperoni what do you want on it im hungry you can turn everything around so easily this is not just another game is it i said i didnt plan on getting involved youve got to face the things you feel then show me who you are does anyone nobody could attack you you set your life up like one of your chessboards youre impregnable but at the same time youve become trapped behind your own defenses youre cut off from everyone around you im just trying to get to know you peter yes you are youre playing word games have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games and you it mustve been very hard on erica im sorry i dunno wheres erica mother no you were talking about chess you always want to talk about me what about you im sure you are can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it because i think hes wrong no you know andy thinks youre doing this how could you unless you were there how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw no im not involved and i plan on keeping it that way no because i work with them of course you have to win every point dont you youre projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did thats not fair i think its best if we dont ask too many personal questions i want to keep things on a professional level lets change the subject of course thats true but the emotion is still there they just learn to control it how can you look at it so clinically this isnt a game another kind of game does whats going on bother you at all or are you just wearing your game face you sound like my mother i dont think i could what if she isnt where are your priorities you have to think between someones life and a chess game the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage she could be dead after the game but youre the key the one he wants to play the game with we need your help they couldnt break the riddle nothing i just came in for a steam well i think ive had enough well i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play krikorian you do you always open quickly i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess are you disappointed that i wont answer you thats a very personal question but you enjoy being the stronger one you like the control sounds very violent it seems like such a complicated game ive always wanted to learn how to play chess i dont have the patience for it when did you start playing are you one of the players are you with the tournament because i love them but they drive me crazy you know how parents are i love this hotel i stay here every time i visit my parents is this your first time here its alrightwhats the first street what are you talking about itll take hours you cant make me

to prison mister bernie i know that scares you but so you can call me naive mister laplante well as you like to point out mister laplante im relatively inexperienced my naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance i was inspired by the hero how he stuck his neck out for others how he took a chance i took a loan on my car and my computer mister laplante i really want to help you but crazy stories are only going to make it worse the da is asking your bail be set at twentyfive thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail the angel of flight 104 youre telling me youre the a uh i know youre having financial difficulties mister laplante but i wonder if i mean the money i loaned you i think you should visit your son and try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job you need to create the impression of a responsible decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once its november how recently i understand how often do you see your son are you pretty involved in his upbringing and a son by your exwife joseph we can hope you still have your job right i think our best course right now would be to focus on the probation officers report he means prison mr laplante i got your bail continuedmister laplante bernie i just for a few moments i want to be a human being not a reporter im somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and i looked up and some man came out of the smoke his face smeared with mud and soot and and he saved my life off the record was it you why would you deny it if it was because you took my purse why was it you in the plane who saved my life listen mister laplante uh bernie who are you i snuck in well for your childs sake show some decency then rise above your sleazy instincts you may have already killed him well maybe i wouldnt liebut i could tell the story the way i did just now so that people could understand that john is even more of a hero and that you youre the lowest thing that ever crawled your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail you wont get a cent i could deny i had those credit cards on the plane with me laplante all this is off the record chucky because if john bubber lives mister laplante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more misbehavior on his part whats more hes going to apologize in all that smoke and fire john had a moment of weakness hed been down and out destitute living in his car it was just an impulse stealing my purse you think i havent figured it out just because the cops arent on to you yet doesnt mean youre home free im a veteran reporter ive seen your kind before the underbelly of crime a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet blackmailing a national hero he had one tiny uncharacteristic moment of weakness thats not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime yes everybody is in love with john bubber the whole country in fact and theyre not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little moneygrubbing lowlife fence if anything happens to john bubber mister laplante im going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law here here ten thirty fifty bucks how much have you got chucky give mister laplante your money if youre not in the car in ten seconds ill have the cops pick you up for gods sake tell him im on my way lets go chucky a police escort is gon na pick us up en route you too laplante whats your scheme mister laplante what are you forcing john bubber to do what are you how did you acquire this mister laplante camera chucky are you bernard laplante sir what is your relationship with john bubber no john youre too hard on yourself ive got the creep here the guy whos john i know all about it its no big deal it just looks better carrying me oh you mean because i wasnt carrying my purse at the time i just remembered you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing there like that kind of uh sexy you can support me anytime john youre doing fine you didnt actually lift me though it was more like you supported me now you help me up boy you seem taller it must be psychological now that i know you saved my life read it itll be fine you were very inspiring goodnight john i know the truth john im flying in some guys from your unit in vietnam tomorrow interviewing them live on network hookup no i dont have the right youre a news story you did save my life and its me id be taking advantage of you im a reporter john an experienced professional i i i know that john years there are going to be lots of opportunities uh if you could just uh support uh a small airfield john im sure she could support just about anything i think ill see you to your room a sort of bodyguard make sure no harm comes to you youre a celebrity john people are going to want to please you or use you or both unworthy of the adoration we all do instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody youve known john bubber all your life youre used to him you know youre the same human being you were before all the excitement so you feel like a fraud all the adulation it makes you feel like a fake doesnt it you were saying you dont want a million dollars because he was a real hero chucky he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency not out of some ego thing he didnt expect the media to lionize him he didnt expect a million dollar reward he saved fiftyfour people because something inside him some fundamental love for his fellow man made him rush into that plane when good sense told him otherwise he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante for how much laplante a couple of bucks did you give him enough for a decent meal and sold it to mister laplante the fence whos now trying to blackmail poor john for excellence in the pursuit of truth thesilvermikeaward this sofa is a lethal weapon the springs are the springs what youre lucky chucky you ow maybe maybe not i have a feeling this guy is important somehow whatre we talking about reach out for what did you get it jesus did i say that hell do it you reallyshould have talked to him first there could be problems with something like that mister wallace what if a mystery guy not a passenger who you said all the passengers were accounted for would the station put me up at a good hotel the story behind the story the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire the dirt you mean you just cant bear the idea of good news it would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical hardbitten newswoman besides it wouldnt be a bad story would it newswoman saves suicide i havent won it yet i notice youve got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony i said i wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him i didnt say i thought we should have saved him hello mister wallace hi chief you like the suicide i wonder if youd mind if we waited for him here mister winston shouldnt we have buzzed him to let him know we couldnt find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox but were from channel four yes wed like to find reporters have to rise above their hormones dont be ridiculous im a reporter hes pretty remarkable look at the guy he just saved fifty people now hes going to disappear who is he nobody stole my credit cards they burned up

what a lovely name las vegas well i dont care who she is we cant sing without her an entertainer yes two men and they had guns we cant sing without her what should we do its no use she just isnt here mary clarence dont be silly youre an example to us all youve taught us so much were singing for the cardinals and then who knows maybe the choir can travel to schools and nursing homes ice cream its brought people back to the church its better than springtime id rather sing than do anything hes decent that was exciting mary clarence has a background in music thats what reverend mother said is this like your old convent since mary clarence came to st katherines ive been shot at kidnapped by mafia hit men and ive tasted beer is that enough experience yet for final vows reverend mother las vegas shes here somewhere she said they were from her old convent i dont understand where is shereally perhaps well thank you oh dont push it perhaps not perhaps we can all use a little spandex you have evidenced great maturity mary robert we shall have a serious discussion very well i hold you responsible for all of this for introducing a lounge act into my convent for utterly disrupting our way of life and for placing all of us in mortal danger thankyou im a christian oh saving you move good day i am sorry mary clarence i seem to have misplaced my tambourine good day mary clarence you and i know that life is not so simple there will be disappointments rude shocks and you will have vanished how fortunate a part of what mary clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday you have raised the sisters expectations you have excited and confused them they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party indeed after how long a few weeks i have been here thirty years and yet it would seem i know nothing i must go where i can be of use i have submitted my resignation to bishop ohara privately i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible really well that makes two of us you have a phone call the majority has spoken of course mary clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole a membership that i am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program i believe this can be settled by a simple vote the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church they command the utmost respect your more secular entertainment would be wholly out of place and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best and i am refusing as of tomorrow mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir out of the question through blasphemy you have corrupted the entire choir and what next popcorn curtain calls this is not a theater or a casino the choir mary clarence go for the gold youre my olympic event you will sing and you will sleep that is your schedule until you depart as almost no one attends mass you will be unable to cause further damage you have i believe some minimal background in music therefore you are to join our choir you may stay but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task mary clarence perhaps you are correct clearly you have learned nothing and you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself mary clarence i have given you every opportunity to change to make a decent life for yourself mary roberts life was in danger your behavior was inexcusable i dont believe we have anything to say to each other months of work and the loom absolutely ruined good mary patrick i need you in the office mary clarence carry on how to put it ah of course mary clarence no pain no gain do your recall the words of saint peter in ecciesiastes 127 he spoke unto a wastrel youth he said take up thy task and know ye the path of contentment you are correct sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation such as your own for example how do you feel about physical labor we are nuns we seek solutions through prayer this is a convent not a clinic we offer moral guidance not hardware a balloon and a banana tell me mary clarence what were you thinking mary clarence come sister girls this is sister mary clarence shell be minding you until sister mary patricks return mary clarence please assign a biblical passage do not attempt discussion am i understood from all ive heard just about everything your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead im sure if i were you i would use this time to think about my life and its direction or lack thereof it is nine pm pleasant dreams your cell is more than adequate and whom would you call useless distractions our lives are simple we have little need for material possessions your cell your room this shall be your cell mary clarence yes until breakfast no food not until sundown a fast to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat as a new member of our order i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast until sundown surely you are familiar with this practice mary clarence only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence and the vow of chastity the vow of obedience the mary is in deference to the holy mother the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola there are three vows that every nun must accept the vow of poverty as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all while you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun only i shall know who and what you truly are you will not disrupt the convent you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk you will draw no attention to yourself in any way excused open the cabinet to your left you will find appropriate attire would you like that before we do you might like to freshen up and youll certainly want to change of course but its almost lunch check your drivers license absolutely not i mean the wicked the heedless and their las vegas concubines and all those like you i joined this convent some thirty years ago at that time the world knew some measure of peace and hope our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise and as the years have passed i have watched that promise destroyed drugs gangs spandex and so i have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls it has come to pass your cigarette out miss van cartier sit down i see the reason you were unhappy st annes very well enough joking your name what is your full name your christian name however we can also pray for other things all right its a beginning las vegas nevada she shouldnt have come back she knew she was in danger really mary clarence how is your weaving progressing i need to see you at once girls please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments mary clarence sister mary patrick yes mary patrick yes but where but she was a showgirl she didnt have an old convent calm down think clearly mary robert do you have any idea who those men were her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her pull yourselves together but bishop surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood i lied but bishop were a small convent bishop surely there are more appropriate shelters but shes been exposed to the underside of life she is
