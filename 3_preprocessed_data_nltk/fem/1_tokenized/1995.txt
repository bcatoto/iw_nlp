clipped her where was that house the one in la i mean years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western the guy was polite and didnt argue about the price he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room the room had a bed and a dresser he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up i felt kind of guilty because he hadnt come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and began dressing when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car i remember being relieved that i wouldnt have to work again that evening shall we go away for a couple of days ill be back home around three if youre back by then we can watch tv or something i guess what im saying is that i hope you are back when i get home please be careful they wouldnt know do you want me not to go tonight yes ill give you that i dont understand any of that what was that all about your color very creative now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers be careful heres my speech i know this shouldnt be acceptable to me but it is dont ask me why i sense that your trouble is very big and im scared for you and so im doing what i think you need me to do falling down in casinos is little stuff it doesnt bother me it has nothing to do with us you were ok for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but i think even you knew that wasnt going to happen we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though i told you that we had plenty at home in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change i asked you if you knew it was a hundred you said you did so i let you do it we got here you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home i also promised that we would never come in there again i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me but more just waving me away security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street but i talked them into letting me walk you out well i was prepared for worse but it wasnt so bad we were sitting at the bar talking about blackjack you seemed just fine a little drunker than usual but nothing really strange but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then wham you swung you arm at me and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress you smashed everything on her tray it was a real mess you kept yelling and yelling how are you doing i expect some kind of loyalty here just because i fuck for money doesnt give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly well then i hope we dont run into any tonight tomorrow night as a matter of fact i am planning to go out and do some work then come im going to change watch tv ill be half an hour do you want to go gambling tonight we could go out and play for a few hours nice talk

sorry about getting on your case earlier i just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper and i anyway im sorry ok he asks about you all the time its been weeks since youve seen him sure now youre really getting paranoid thats where it gets a little strange okay so hes a freak who thinks hes sane pretending to be a freak the point is he was a hitter somebody wanted to shut her up but why not

to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor i know it makes me crazy no isnt it interesting though i mean look at us in this room or yesterday when we were walking in

doggies doing their business my jewish friends grandmother did i simply can not stand that tone you said it in that tone like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch well why dont i just say black so you can say white dont be surprised to find your brother hasnt changed an iota he hardly ever talks and when he does its in that tone you should have heard him at lunch not two words until the bill came and then he says worth every penny well thats a long time boy it sure has been a long time michael doesnt understand people who make the kind of money my brother makes dont carry money on them they keep it all in various accounts no we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife she told me all the dirt i forgot how interesting things

not need instructions from you to bathe i knew youd do this i knew id come all the way here and be shut out as usual i came to be here for you i didnt have to come lord knows i was never much welcome in this house before apparently dead or alive nothings changed no treasure maps huh how bizarre eeeww i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what ive doneno you can have them aw betty no oh just a old letter from a friend mr peterson are you sure mama wrote all this i know i dont understand it either im sure you havent done anything have some iced tea how are the kids youre right that is sick for over twenty years because thats what i was taught you stick with it normal people dont get divorced i cant remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe for christs sake quite frankly i dont think he ever did and now i find out in between bake sales my mother was anais nin what gets me is im 46 years old ive been in this crummy fucking marriage did we want to was this during betty i never knew that you never dated kathy reynolds i think i better between the book and the coffee im this close to raping the busboy boy all these years ive resented not living the wild life in some place like paris and all the time i couldve moved back to iowa are you drunk you mean she didnt like sex yeah but i thought she died have you called betty maybe you should and do what live alone go back to school find someone else start a magazine for confused woman what if i cant do any of those things oh dont feel sorry for me please no ones forcing me to stay i dont think so not yet anyway and besides something like that doesnt make you a bad person he reminds me of steve in a way steves weak immoral and a liar but hes still a real nice guy he just shouldnt be married at least not to me you getting hungry im hungry oh he did not hes such a nice guy stop it i want to read them if you dont want to then just leave but dont you push me around like im some mule you paid for i already got a husband well id like to read them what are you doing its all there in the three notebooks read them in order if you dont want to i suppose thats okay too but in that case i want you to know something i never stopped loving your father he was a very good man its just that my love for robert was different he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before or since he made me feel like a woman in a way few women maybe more ever experience sshhh after going through the safety deposit box im sure youll find youre way to this letter its hard to write this to my own children i could let this die with the rest of me i suppose but as one gets older one fears subside what becomes more and more important is to be known known for all that you were during this brief stay row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were its easy for a mother to love her children no matter what its something that just happens i dont know if its as simple for children youre all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong but i thought it was important to give you that chance to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was no i dont think so i i cant believe she never told me we spoke at least once a week how could she do that dont say that my lord it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny i dont know im completely in the dark here thats what i get for moving away 82 that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge that would be some trick hes already dead thats what this other letter is from his attorney he left most of his things to mama and requested well he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him she could find him through the national geographic magazine he as a photographer he promises not to write again then all it says is i love you robert going over and over in my mind every detail every moment of our time together and i ask myself what happened to me in madison county i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing were on separate roads but then i look through the lens of my camera and youre there i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you its clear to me now we have been moving towards each other towards those four days all our lives come here a minute michael i remember a mrs delaney but mama told me years ago she died well theres a problem hes not coming i have some sandwich fixings if youre hungry moms ordersno leave it ill do it later listen maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday im sure richardll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all no no i just didnt sleep well im not used to sleeping alone and this heat would you mind i dont know i woke up a little dizzy i didnt sleep well i think i need to lay down madge please somethings happened ive met someone ive fallen in love in a way ive never thought could happen my entire life its our last day together i feel like im going to die when he leaves please help me madge robert if that happens youll have to decide i wont be able to no dont do this i dont know please i want to keep it forever i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life dont you understand well lose it if we leave i cant make an entire life disappear to start a new one all i can do is try to hold onto to both help me help me not lose loving you robert please you dont understand no one does when a woman makes the choice to marry to have children in one way her life begins but in another way it stops you build a life of details you become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move and when they leave they take your life of details with them and then youre expected move again only you dont remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long not even yourself you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you we are the choices weve made robert no matter how much distance we put between us and this house i bring with it with me and ill feel it every minute were together and ill blame loving you for how much it hurts and then even these four days wont be anything more than something sordid and a mistake youve got to know deep down that the minute we leave here itll all change no they dont say much but carolyns 16 shes just about to find out about all this for herself shes going to fall in love shes going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone if i leave what does that say to her his familys lived for almost a hundred years richard doesnt know how to live anywhere else and the kids for anyone theyll never be able to live through the talk richard will never be able to he doesnt deserve that he hasnt hurt anyone in his life no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind it doesnt seem like the right thing what makes it different robert what does that have to do with it why you wont be made to feel period youve carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time youve touched our lives well go to hell it isnt human not to feel lonely it isnt human not to afraid youre a hypocrite and youre a phony no ones asking you to fine more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time i dont want you to say anything i dont need you to say anything you have no idea what youve done to me do you and after you leave im going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here if anything happened at all and ill have to wonder if you find yourself in some housewifes kitchen in romania if youll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group i know you what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesnt need meaning who goes with the mystery who pretends he isnt scared to death gee i dont know i guess im not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time yes absolutely you have this habit of not needing and that its hard to break i understand of course in that case why sleep you dont need rest or for that matter eat you dont need food to do what be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular i mean what would be the point would you pass the butter well what is this well i just want to know the procedure i dont want to upset your routine do you want any jam well these women friends of yours all over the world how does it work do you see some of them again do you forget others do you write them now and then how do you manage it good more coffee robert i hope you dont mind my asking but i feel like i should sleep all right no long day go to sleep where was she youre right you know we dont have much time just that its been a perfect day and that id like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this what what were your parents like i just wondered why were you trouble what were you like when you were younger but you dont mind why do you say that i bet you could do a book on that one is beautiful look at their expressions as if the camera werent on them at all as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling i sat there once it was hot like today id been shopping i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by where near the doorway or the near the front of the church and arraccinos and zeppolis yes i know it why because im having thoughts i hardly know what to do with i cant seem to stop them i just feel like im getting a little out of control thats all its kind of frightening oh im sorry yes yes tell me about the day you got off the train yes right now tell me someplace youve been someplace on the other side of the world anywhere but here take me somewhere are you hungry no i cant not yet yes thatd be nice sure actually no ive got everything under control id like to clean up myself a bit im going to take a bath dinnerll be ready in about a half hour fine theyre all having a good time how many more shots do you have sorry im late richard called i want you to come i understand thats very kind of you i think hes running for town crier next year oh i guess you got the whole story oh oh hi look im running a little late but ill still yeah see you later no ill drive myself i have a few errands ill meet you there oh sure great wonderful uh the light was fading huhhuh no i was just no yes hi i feel like somethings been spoiled now listen im sorry i i thought we were just having a conversation you seem to be reading all this meaning into it meanings i must be too simple to uh interpret or something what made you ask such a question just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesnt necessarily mean theyre hypnotized just because ive never seen a gazelle stampede doesnt mean im asleep in the world no im just saying but its not the same but no one in particular but how can you just live for what you want what about other people do you ever regret not having a family do you ever regret it the divorce i mean why doesnt it scare you you really dont need anyone woman friends too you must get lonely at times so what happened do you mind if i ask you why you got divorced what yes what no ill do them later umm i dont know i can look it up what no im all right its working when smells like dirt you drink bug repellent well its kind of buggy out there my god how id love to see that no its all right i just meant it might be a little dull for you telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere i dont know ive never thought about it what was the most exciting place youve ever been to unless youre tired of talking about it my children and richard didnt like my working id like to think so i know one of them went on to medical school i didnt mean that the way it sounded i dont think youre normal you sound like an artist why do you think making pictures i like that you really love what you do dont you you ought to write these stories down oh you then what happened oh my god youre blushing what okay help cook would you like to stay for dinner there arent many choices in town and anyway youd have to eat alone so would i but i we dont even know each other i feel so embarrassed i think so much yes very clean no i mean yes hes clean but hes also other things hes a very hard worker very honest very caring gentle good father hes very clean richard was in the army i met him while i was living in naples i didnt know where iowa was i only cared that it was america and of course being with richard why i guess except im one of the people it frightens oh michaels 17 and carolyns 16 about a year and a half my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair my

know what he wants whos going to catch him you and if you do therell be another one and one after that ah if you knew that youd be half way to nailing him serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex hes playing a game with us who will he imitate next maybe hes doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers hall of fame just to prove hes better than all of them they got caught he didnt its what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex thats a product for cleaning with is that it there were needle marks but no drugs in her blood please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night ruben that little winona ryder manner youre more convincing as clint eastwood have you got a warrant get the hell out o here this is the only space i have left in the world why cant you leave me out of it i turned it off its like an open window he can climb right in youre saying its the same man but hes changed his style that doesnt happen these men are robotic the murder is like a ritual the method itself is part of the pleasure then what do you need me for thats no surprise hes going home he slept over because i was a little anxious because im his damned pinup girl his all of them they know me theyre in prisons with libraries they collect clippings im their worthy opponent you keep my name out of this its anybody connected to author ity they write they even knock on your door theyre fans it thrills them to flirt with getting caught she probably let him in the door without a thought where are their mothers where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight maybe thats why you cant catch him i know what she looks like the redheaded woman in my computer i am not going to look at any more pictures theyre like a disease they get into my head i cant get them out show what its gone he wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it then it erased itself gone do you remember what you saw one officer already got killed trying to protect me please just take it all away leave me alone its too big a file to copy to a disk look at the bottom of the screen you see the icon with the arrow pointing left click on that twice if you knew why you might know where to look for him i dont envy you this hes not done hes going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush now ive done what you asked me i sent andy out on murder missions for gods sake its the boston strangler alber desalvo he used their own stockings to strangle them tied in a bowknot where are the stockings he strangled them with the bodies have been carefully arranged different positions but somehow the same the positions are brutal yet quite artful its like a signature hes proud of his accomplishments there are early picassos and late picassos but you always recognize the hand he wants us to recognize his hand ive seen this hand before what are you hiding he felt remorse he covered her it was a lover or a husband someone close somebody who knew her and cared about her is it an ongoing case will you go andy make them go inspector halloran that is so much bullshit you dont like or admire me but the beautiful part is i dont give a fuck thats the upside of having a breakdown oh my god no im a clinical hysteric with panic syndrome and anxiety neurosis agoraphobic im afraid of everything real and imaginary i never leave this apartment now nobody ever comes here i just wanted to get your attention i write and i used to lecture on these crimes but im not competent well lets thank god you and inspector goetz are on the case then yes i did poor impulse control the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man but you kept announcing they were unrelated youll never catch him that way you dont admire me no police admire me i got one of you killed why dont you say right out what youre here for what calls i havent made any calls if hes not out why are they here is he out i think this is number three youre calling me a crank who is this what else they taught me at the fbi i was very good at it it scared me i liked it he

going to attack me what i m rally afraid of is all in my own head ruben are you always so bold you and maryjane arent lovers that would be much appreciated thanks maryjane you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night i did once but you know how hell get caught hell have an accident or some cop will get lucky you cant catch him by being intelligent and working hard or the worst there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark and then one day there are no more what happened did he just stop get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more did he kill himself did he die in an auto accident or a fight or get sick and die its like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth and you never know but you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back i know halloran whats the rest of it hes brilliant this one is brilliant its gone the files not here what did you do its a game they like to play berkowitz son of sam hung around the crime scene talking to the cops this ones probably watching you laughing at you he can get into my computer any time he likes this is exactly the kind of

hospital when he found out louisa was dead jesus had nothing to do with it if hed been involved he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did dont put words in my mouth what im saying is she drove off in cyruss car and went to the fivespot lounge with him for a drink what im saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive but he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple his left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off small punishment for what he did if you ask me his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born louisa was henrys younger sister and she and the baby moved in with us four or five years go by and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue tail between his legs wanting to patch things up with louisa i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door theyre both big men those two and if they ever started to tangle youd see some teeth jumping on the floor i guarantee it so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet and the poor girl never came back and nothing thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said i dont have a father as far as im concerned that sonofabitch is dead i figured he had a right to know well one thing i suppose but i dont think it has anything to do with this a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said shed spotted thomass father working at some gas station outside of peekskill no thank you hes in trouble all right but i dont have any idea what it is which brings me back to my original question what was he doing here in the first place his mothers dead and he hasnt seen his father in twelve years he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn i always knew that boy had an imagination but now hes gone and made up a whole new life for himself do you mind if i sit down hes been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby and we dont live in manhattan we live in boerum hill in the projects his parents is that what he told you his parents i just want to know where he is and what was he doing here in the first place thats what i want to know whats a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for are you some kind of pervert or what

fresno and he says three billion people are going to die he was fully sedated i said it was bad judgment what else do you want me to say okay it was bad judgment but i have the strangest feeling about him ive seen him somewhere and i didnt think i was being defensive i was just no thank you yes please you said he gave a name that would explain the bruises i guess the struggle you have him in restraints hes been tested for drugs what what did you say tight my watch says 730 nine thirtytwelve monkeys honey guess you folks didnt turn on your radio this morning on your normal mornin okay plenty a time but today got ta take inta account your armyofthetwelvemonkeys factor might be tightgot it i dont set policy you have the key i need your help there is no way parker killed those guards no way captain im afraid of how smart sid 67 is but im even more afraid of whats hes becoming im not sure my guess is thats what sid wants us to think i should have told him until we know what new influences are affecting him we cant be sure any sign of lindenmeyer the man played judge jury and executioner with eight peoples lives he lost control and is capable of doing it again letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse at some point he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous whats the assignment ms deane you wanted to see me then fix it talk so i can understand turn it down show me his physical sensory level whats wrong with parker what do we do now duck i couldnt tell you lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had i dont know my guess is dead more or less you okay thats why im asking youve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon you stopped sid 67 and youve got his module youre free to go ï½ï½ right now why are you going to do this can i ask you something find out anything thanks im not sureon the bridgethe guy at the payphone that or living through him if we find sid lindenmeyer wont be far behind sid 67 isnt grimes the rallys a little obvious as a target dont you think i was wrong and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid i should have told you i wont make the same mistake again youre not capable of it how did you find out about the toxin he didnt know about the neural toxin i did we know you didnt kill those guards no grimes isnt back hes only one part of sid sid 67 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was get a hold of yourself parker ï½ stop stop dont make me shoot youï½ï½ which way you could have just flashed him your badge you know its not just sid 67s performances that are increasing stars need bigger and bigger audiences whatever sid is going to do next its going to involve media i dont know yet what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale not decreasing whatever it is he isnt finished whatever he was doing here was only the start im doing the best i can this isnt a game parker enjoying yourself what did you do to those people what the hells going on dont get out of the car i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them dammit i hate sounding so clinical all the time all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well but then i you know considering youve only been out of prison for seven hours youre reï½adapting quite well wait i didnt mean that the way it sounded i meant what i do know is that whatever hes becoming sid 67 is going to be even worse than he was before now that hes in the real world there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality sid is going to evolve sid 67 is no longer bound by his programming i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes thankyou her name is karin i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life how did you get your hand out and im going to make sure of it give me your wrist give me your wrist in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory we need to get a look at sid 67s final profile as a matter of fact it is but rather than selecting pieces from each individual he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain hes part of the mix sid 67 is a composite who said that i am impressed i am the demon from the bottomless pit the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids brains im still working on it this lindenmeyers a real piece of work checking my pulse its elevated you enjoy frightening me dont you youve got a problem with me carrying a gun every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers stay here he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 all he did day and night was play the violin ive spent over 50 hours interviewing him charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate after seeing the blood bath on television he wanted to show them how it should be done the question is what does charlie have to do with sid 67 whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better ï½ï½ to improve upon what was already done he was reï½enacting charles mansons labianca murders you ready for this you all right it wasnt a lie what you need is a collar i need to know what snapped in you what made you capable of it you have to make me understand it was just like before wasnt it wasnt it but you are making progress instead of killing seven people to get the one youre after this time there was only one other person involved you didnt see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger but i did you kind of liked it didnt you that thrill of going over the edge again of taking out an innocent bystander or two as long as you got the target what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy thats not true parker i know i was there i saw the whole thing if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation in other words par for the course how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you how you feeling today
