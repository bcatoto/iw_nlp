Well, look at them. Do you like this, Salieri? Yes? Really? Of course not. Oh? Why not? I don't think you understand me, Court Composer. Well. There it is. You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea. Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart. And the result satisfies. Yes? I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view? Good morning, Court Composer. This is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth. Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue. Well, I'm glad to hear that. Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say? And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri. Ah-ha! Let's have some fun. Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But slowly, slowly. I need a minute to practice. Delightful, Court Composer. Would you permit me to play it as he comes in? May I try it? What a charming idea. May I see? You are cattivo, Court Composer. I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him. You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade. Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight! I have no idea. Ah, love again. I think you are rather innocent, my friend. In these dangerous times I cannot afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece. Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here. Would you tell me why? It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true? Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true? Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre? Ah! By all means. What is it? Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man. Well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in Vienna. Excuse me, but how old are you? Really? How delightful. May I ask when you marry? Enchanted, Madame. My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect. My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer? Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say? How shall one say, Director? Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate. Oh, yes. Absolutely. German. Unquestionably! Yes, indeed. What? On one hearing only? Ah-ha. Yes, where? Well, what is it about? Tell us the story. Why so? Did we vote in the end for German or Italian? And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you. The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg. No, no, please! It is not a holy relic. You know we have met already? In this very room. Perhaps you won't remember it, you were only six years old. He was giving the most brilliant little concert here. As he got off the stool, he slipped and fell. My sister Antoinette helped him up herself, and do you know what he did? Jumped straight into her arms and said, Will you marry me, yes or no? Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good. Yes, what about him? Well, what do you have for me today? Well. There it is. Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain? Very small pay, I imagine. I'm sure he could be tempted with the right offer. Say, an opera in German for our National Theatre. Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you! Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance. Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully. Sir - Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him. But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding. So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time. And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day? But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of! When, may I ask? I see that you're expecting. Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.' She does. She says I sleep all day. Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden. Never mind. You won't have to do anything for me ever again. I'm leaving! I never saw this girl in my life. Is this a kind of joke? Mine? I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. No, really! Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me. Why didn't you mention it in your letters? You don't have secrets from me. Why not? What's that? Composition doesn't pay. You know that. How many? Yes. How many pupils do you have? They say you're in debt. That's not what I hear. How is your financial situation? Don't you have a maid? Do you always live like this? Is she not here? Am I not welcome? I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.What do you mean? These Viennese certainly know good music when they hear it. Well, I think that went off remarkably well, don't you? Certainly! Excuse us, Fraulein. Good night, Signore. What?? No, she's fine. Oh - excuse me! I'll be right back. What? Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage. No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy. If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me. Humiliated? Why what, sir? Go back to bed. It's killing me. I can't write it! Give me two more weeks. Please. This is my wife, Stanzi. I've been sick, but I'm all right now. Aren't I? No. Don't answer it! You'd think I was mad. I'm not telling you. No one. Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand! Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki. Oh, Stanzi. Why not? Half the house! Half the receipts! Stanzi! What? Salzburg. We were just talking about Salzburg. If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with! Yes, my love? We'll have a little party. Come in. Come in. You know Herr Schikaneder? This is! a very nice girl. Stanzi! Oh, damn! Well, ask her! What does she want? What? How can you be so boring? Tea! Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you? He's not Herr Mozart. Call him Papa. My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter? Yes! Sssh. What is it? Tell me. What's the matter with you? Stop it now. Stop it. I've brought some friends to meet you. They're next door waiting. Do we have anything to eat? They're all starving. Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them. Don't be stupid. Well, don't do that again! You borrowed money from your mother? Oh yes? You always know everything. They'll come anyway. They love me here. Oh, leave me alone. Of course. Yes. Tish-I'm-tee. Tish-I'm tee. What's that? Ui-vol-i-tub! Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram! Em iram! No, this is serious. Say it backwards. Em iram! Em iram! No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards! Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick! Yes, I think it's brilliant. You've been doing it for years. Why? People fart backwards. Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards. Go ahead, tell him. Tell them all. They won't understand you anyway. We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg. Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are? I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back. Thank you, Madame. Come on now - courage. Play me something you know. Who was your teacher? I'd like a little wine, if you have it. Really? Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it? Forgive me, Majesty. I'm a vulgar man. But I assure you, my music is not. Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives. Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it. But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on. On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that? But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love. Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics. Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy. Well, yes, I admit it is. Who told you this, Majesty? Yes, Sire. May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him. Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour? Thank you, Sire! Twenty-six. Well - Well we haven't quite received my father's consent, Your Majesty. Not entirely. Not altogether. Majesty, this is Madame Weber. She is my landlady. Which few did you have in mind, Majesty? I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less. What do you mean, Sire? So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty? And German? It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire? I think so, Sire, yes. Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head. In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio. It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the whole thing is set in a - in a - Because I've already found the most wonderful libretto! Majesty! Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo! Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely. Oh, thank you. Your Majesty! Father - No one calls you that. Papa! Are you playing a trick on me? Papa, is this your idea? But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! This is just a game, Papa. Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa! Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did. Isn't that marvelous? We're delighted. It's too dangerous, Papa. But they're going to love it. Ah, there she is! It's a secret. Oh, let's not talk about it. This one will. I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition. Yes. Pupils? Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie! What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here. It couldn't be better. Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself. She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me. Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see. I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi! Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. She stuffs me like a goose all day long. She's the best cook in the world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, you'll see. Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa! Why are you here? I will. Are you saying that someone is paying you to be our maid and doesn't want us to know who he is? What? That's right. Yes? Well, we can. Because there's nothing to see. No. Yes. What? Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you. Put it down! Leave that alone! No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio. German! Animals? I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it. I liked the horse. Wonderful! He liked the monkey, didn't you? That kind of music should be punishable by death. Well? Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. Sssh! Stay here. Sssh! Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir. No doubt, sir. But I am endowed with talent, and you with money. If I offer mine, you should offer yours. If a man cannot earn, he must borrow. Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead? Really? Perhaps your dear wife might care to profit from my instruction? Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music? Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir! Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose. How long have you been playing, Fraulein? Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg. I'm afraid I am. Madame. And which one of them do you want me to teach? I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me! I am so ashamed. Would you stay with me while I sleep a little? We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa. Do you want to rest a bit? Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now! Do you have it? And that's it. Do you have it? Yes, and on 'dictis'. C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above. Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis. Yes, yes - go on. The Voca Me. Suddenly sotto voce. Write that down: sotto voce, pianissimo. Voca me cum benedictis. Call me among the blessed. Show me. Do you have me? Oh no. Now for the Fire. Strings in unison - ostinato on all - like this. Exactly. The instruments to go with the voices. Trumpets and timpani, tonic and dominant. With the tenors. It couldn't be simpler. Now the orchestra. Second bassoon and bass trombone with the basses. Identical notes and rhythm. The first bassoon and tenor trombone - Fourth measure, second beat - F. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis, flam- mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, fourth beat on D. Ma-le-dic-tis. All right? Sing it back. Third measure, second beat starting on E. Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis. And fourth measure, fourth beat - D. Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis. Do you have that? Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A. Con-fu-ta-tis. Second measure, second beat. Ma-le-dic-tis. G-sharp, of course. Common time. The Fire. So now - A minor. Suddenly. We ended in F Major? Strange! A fire which never dies. Burning one forever? Do you believe in it? So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that? Where did I stop? A Mass. A Mass for the Dead. You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write. But you'd have to swear not to tell a soul. I'm not allowed. Would you? Actually, you could. Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred? He knows. He knows! Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it. The man. He's here. No! No, it's him! I'm too young to be so sick. The doctor thinks I am. But - I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things. Do you mean that? This is only a vaudeville. I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did. You're so good to me. Truly. Thank you. Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa. No, no. I have to get back. I have - What happened? Is it over? No, no! I promise you, I'll give you a wonderful piece - the best I ever can! I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time. How long will you give me? How much? Who are you? What dead? Who is dead? What work? Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri! I never knew that music like that was possible. How could it not, Excellency? How could I not? Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio! Oh no, the honour would be all mine. I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that. It's the best opera yet written. I know it! Why didn't they come? What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all? But what is it they don't like? Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn. Thank you! Oh, thank you. Oh, Excellency, would you? It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work. Oh no! My wife took it out in time. Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry! I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him? It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it. I can't say. Really Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty? Ah. Italian? Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it? I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret. Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe! Do you have a daughter? They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend! How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all! No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why. Look, I must have pupils. Without pupils I can't manage. But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess! Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity. Whom did they choose? Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please! Why? Here is the music. It's here. I am submitting it humbly. Isn't that what you wanted? So you see, this post is very important to me right now. She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know. Your Excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. Here they are. I don't have to tell you how much I need your help. I truly appreciate your looking at these. I have pressures on me - financial pressures. As you know, I'm a married man now. It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree? Did you like it, then? But this is absurd! Love, Sire! A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things. Mio caro Adone. I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours? Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director! What are you doing, Herr Director? But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story. Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding. Certainly, Herr Director. Just let me tell you how it begins. But, Your Majesty - Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care. Exactly. I - I don't think you have, Herr Director. Not yet. I mean, it's quite n - Of course, I'll show it to you immediately. May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that? Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not! Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music! They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid. Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians! Who is on this committee? No, but I'm the best. Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post? Is the Emperor angry with me? Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl. What is this, Herr Chamberlain? Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends? Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous? Baron! Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent! It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely! Oh, German! German! Please let it be German.Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute. No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God! What difference does that make? I poisoned his life. I did. The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands. His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you? Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers! There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture. Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me! All I ever wanted was to sing to Him. That's His doing, isn't it? He gave me that longing - then made me mute. Why? Tell me that. If He didn't want me to serve Him with music, why implant the desire, like a lust in my body, then deny me the talent? Go on, tell me! Speak for Him! No? Was Mozart a good man? Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God. Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray! It was incomprehensible. What was God up to? Here I was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve God's gift and there was Mozart indulging his in all directions - even though engaged to be married! - and no rebuke at all! Was it possible I was being tested? Was God expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense, no matter how painful? That was very possible. All the same, why him? Why use Mozart to teach me lessons in humility? My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man. For the first time in my life I began to know really violent thoughts. I couldn't stop them. He was murdered, Father! Mozart! Cruelly murdered. Do you believe it? And do they believe it? Ah - you've heard that? I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is? Can you recall no melody of mine? I was the most famous composer in Europe when you were still a boy. I wrote forty operas alone. What about this little thing? Well? I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this? Then you must know this. Where? How well are you trained in music? I do not seek forgiveness. Are they? Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you? Leave me alone. What do you want? So? About what? What do you want?Extremely clever. You were sublime. Well, what does it matter to you? What? Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina. You might be disappointed. Perhaps. My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk. A Turkish brothel. A brothel. In a harem. Well, do you know where it's set, my dear? Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one. No. Yes. Oh? News travels fast in Vienna. Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip. Good morning. Madame, I will respect his. He asked me to stay here. No. I was assisting him. He asked me. He asked me to stay. He needs me, ma'am. I was at hand. Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home. What? Then don't. It's up to you. Not to be vague, that is the price. It's a post all Vienna seeks. If you want it for your husband, come tonight. Isn't it obvious? Some service deserves service in return. No? Alone. Come back tonight. Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his. It is miraculous. These are originals? Originals? Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like. Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband. I see. Then he didn't send you? Really? I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe. I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest. I understand. How charming. But why did he not come himself? Frau Mozart? Madame. How can I help you? It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid. Molested, Majesty. Twice, in the course of the same lesson. As a matter of fact, one of my own pupils - a very young singer - told me she was - er - well! I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies. Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician. Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming. Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart. Sire. I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes. Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism. You already commissioned an opera from Mozart. An interesting idea, Majesty. But - Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour! Your Highness. Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn. My pleasure. Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario! A-flat, Majesty. You do me too much honour, Sire. Majesty. It's just a trifle, of course. I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention. Are you sure it's an opera? Opera? Opera! Is he working? Is he working? Where? What medicine? Why? What has happened? Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you? Where does he work? Yes what? Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you? Really? What is it he's writing? Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all? Do any pupils come to the house? Bene. Bene! Bene! Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl? Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my favourites. Give my best thanks to the baker. What have you got for me today? Let me see. Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning. What for? I'm not leaving you. I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try? Oh no. I'm not tired at all. Yes. You go fast! Yes! Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'? That's wonderful! I think so. And that's all? Also identical? First bassoon and tenor trombone - what? Please! Just one moment. Yes. I think so. Yes. What time? Yes. Confutatis Maledictis. Come. Let's begin. Oh, yes. What? Consigned to flames of woe. The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra. Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work? Of course. My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure. Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way? Finish what? What man? Who? Shall I answer it? What? Are you ill? I do. Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me. I would never miss anything that you had written. You must know that. No, please. You mean she's not coming back? Where is your wife? I'm taking you home. You're not well. Are you neglecting my request? Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon. I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well. A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one. A Mass for the dead. I have come to commission work from you. You flatter me. Yes? Did my work please you? Mozart. It was good of you to come. Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang! I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me. I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap? I think it's marvelous. Truly. Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four. I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully. With all my heart, Mozart. But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor. How fortunate. You burned the score? Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours. Really? Why? Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter? I don't think you should become known in Vienna as a debtor, Mozart. However, I know a very distinguished gentleman I could recommend to you. And he has a daughter. Will that do? What exactly are you working on? Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind. Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone. Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly. Ah, how exciting! Tell me more. I'm afraid not. Of course not. How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful. It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means. You don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty? An implausible idea. Between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the Princess Elizabeth. No, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity. Herr Sommer. My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late. I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled. Why didn't you come to me yesterday, Mozart? This is a most painful situation. Yesterday I could have helped you. Today, I can't. I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course. So you are. How is your pretty wife? Herr Mozart, what brings you here? How could I not? Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations. Yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, Majesty. Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that. Ah! Really? Yes, in the third act. Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera? About the ballet. Incredible. Never mind. I've seen the manuscript. Yes. Exactly. Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera. I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director. Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes. No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him. I agree, Baron. Come with me. And stay in the room. What does he want? Show her in. Then go to bed. Excuse me, my dear. Who is she? Yes, indeed. Goodnight to you all now. It was perfection - truly! Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb. Bene. Of course. Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest. Well, he's sleeping now. Better not. Yes, I am looking after him.In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat! Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height. Who the devil are you? What do you want? You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi. Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem? I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous! I'm paying these people. Do you realize that? Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting? I hope so. I need it immediately. Where's our friend? Am I interrupting something? Ah. Well. Ah, I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts? So let me see it. Where is it? Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes. Why not? Can I see it? What? The vaudeville, what'd you think? Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished? What is this? Wolfi! So there you are. What do you say? Of course! What else do you think they speak here? I'm serious. You write a proper part for me with a couple of catchy songs, I'll guarantee you'll have a triumph- de-luxe. Mind you, it'll have to be in German. I tell you I picked up a snake in Dresden last week - twelve foot long - folds up to six inches, just like a paper fan. It's a miracle. 'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those. Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a bundle, that horse, but he's worth it. I tell you, if you'd played Don Giovanni here it would have been a great success. I'm not joking. These people aren't fools. You could do something marvelous for them. Yes, well, it's all good fun. Sublime! Utterly sublime! What did he say? What did he say? Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi! Oh, by the way, give him this. This is his share. That should cheer him up, eh? I'll call tomorrow. And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times. Well, tell him we were here, won't you? But he's all right? Can we come in? Herr Salieri.Oh my son, my poor son! My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it? But not his body. No, you didn't! Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him. Yes. What? I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should. My son, no one can speak for God. God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know. You cannot say that! Did you try? Do you hear me? Should I? Is it true? All Vienna has heard that. Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing. Oh, I know that! That's charming! I didn't know you wrote that. I regret it is not too familiar. I can't say I do. What is it? Here in Vienna. I know a little. I studied it in my youth. My son, there is something dreadful on your soul. Unburden it to me. I'm here only for you. Please talk to me. Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness. That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes. I cannot leave alone a soul in pain. Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely. In the sight of God that is a sin. You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you? I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters. She's mine! You've had it. I'm gonna get you. Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be. Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone! Low mileage... Handles like a dream. I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie. I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap. I love that car. Great car. See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche. I'm ready to make you another deal. I don't want any trouble. Rick, I want to talk to you. He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would. Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools... Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart... Seventy-five hundred. Five thousand dollars. You dump her and I'll give you cash. I want Debbie. And... Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere... Yes I did. Mr. Thomerson. Yes, sir. 1002. The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down... Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir. Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise. What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you. Thanks for the advise, sir. But how can I do that? I've tried to change her mind. Yes, sir, I am. Thank you, sir. Sure have... Hi, everybody. Am I late? I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy. That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me. You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy. You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me? You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough... It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas. Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh? Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.Fine. How's everything going? Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is? Hello?All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself. You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes. Take hold of yourself. What room are they in? Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened? Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling... Shut up, I'm talking here. Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage. Well, tell the asshole to shut up. So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game. Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me? Keep me informed. If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed... ...I'd take more persuasive action. It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there. Cole, I don't want you to give up on her. I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick. Nice shot. So, Cole, you been practicing your game? Not at all. We're just finishing lunch. Any time, Al. Great bathing suit. A real turd. My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch... Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am. Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable... No sob story is going to change my mind. Rick! First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life... Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions... Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes. Rick, I want to cut through the b.s. Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it. All right, who serves? No, Brett, I... The phone made me do it! The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck. In a second... And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words. No. Let's at least finish the set.I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes. Chulo, one thing at a time. Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living. What? Rick's got an important announcement to make. Good. Is that all the coke in the place? Larry, you and your wife got problems? So, Larry, how have you been? I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons? Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture. Mrs.? How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...? You got it. What's with her costume? Debbie. Guess who's here? Another surprise guest. Reach out and snort someone. I'll stop him... You stall him. What are you going to do about it? And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree... Hey, you guys... Take care. Very. Still drawing a blank. Got me. I don't know. I'm proud of you, lad. How'd it go? That's the old Rick! Right in there, pal. I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please. This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet. Rick, I'm concerned. I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now? So long, Father. The best table in the house. My gift to you. C'mon. I insist. Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody. This isn't right. Then it's on to the real thing. We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"... What's the matter? Where the hell is he? Where'd she go?Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro. Okay... This is it... I'm getting married. I've decided not to run for President. We're going for a little liquid refreshment. Fan out and look for them. Cole, what the hell are you doing? Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy? Maybe it had something to do. So does Debbie. Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie? The car for Debbie? I'm very happy for you two. The best. Ooh, be still, my heart. Oh, come on, just a little. Ah, Cole. I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service. Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now. Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away. What is this person's story here? I'm marrying Debbie. Not interested. No. What's Debbie's blue book value right now? Cole... Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding? Bond... James Bond. This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout? Are you okay? You're on. Great. Now, what do you want to do about it? See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand? You don't believe me? Okay, fine. I am committed. I love you. I don't want that. I want to be with you. Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly. C'mon, I knew it was you. How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker. Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap. Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her. Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave. Did I promise that? I don't remember that... Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady. This is it, lady. Last stop. Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're... Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness. Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland. Good... C'mere. I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right. About what? What's the matter? Oh... I got something for that. Huh? Wha... Oh, those. Why do you ask? No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home. Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however. Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think? Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me. Don't worry... it's supposed to do this. It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished. But a fabulous cook. This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on. Gary, how we doing, big stallion? I didn't know you were into that. Hookers beat you up? Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you. Guy paints a beautiful picture. It's true. Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner. Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will. Because I love her. What can I tell you? All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is. Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody. Gary, you're quite an animal. It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful... Hi, guys. We brought back a friend. No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party. Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up. You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor? What the hell are you doing? Really? You okay? Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean. All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest." C'mon, Larry. Be good for you. What do you mean, it changes? Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while. Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck. Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid! I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job. What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later. Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002. Are any of those right? Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E. The end. Oh, no! Welcome, welcome, one and all. Feel free. Mr. Thomerson, I... I'd love that. Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience. Can't I just maim it a little? Oops! I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom. My Debbie? Who? I'm saved. Let's party! What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing. How about this, a Trojan donkey. Who's your friend? Now, don't get into any trouble. C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business. He look familiar? How 'bout this? What's this? Who was that? Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister. If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics. Oooooo. Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens. About what? I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure. I think you'll enjoy this table. Under the table! What the hell is that? I'm not really hungry. Don't you love it when old friends stop by? Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican. Olivier's in that, right? Nothing... Let's get crazy! Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight. She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce. Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing? Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help. Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect? Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break. That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood. Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay? True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already? You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky. Right... Think it over. Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book. You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak. I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.Then she must have run out of the room and you found her. When she saw the insects she passed out cold. I carried her back to her room. She was sleeping when I re- entered the tunnel to look around. I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me. Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat. Makes you wonder what these people are... Something magical. A sacred rock. The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive. You're hanging on better here than you did in America. You think so? It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him. No. But I am interested in the occult. And this is a kryta. Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood! Yes, I understand. That was a misunderstanding. The newspapers exaggerated the incident. I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones... When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them. Sorry, I thought we were just talking about folklore. You know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them. Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace? Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil. I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard. Yes, very fine. But not all of the pieces look old. Some were carved recently and look like images used by the Thuggees to worship the goddess Kali. I had a question, Mr. Prime Minister. I was examining some of the Maharajah's artifacts. We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning. Lost? No, we're not lost. We're on our way to Delhi. This is Miss Scott -- and Mr. Round. My name's Indiana Jones. Now what about the antidote, Lao. What's that? Next time I'll cut off more than his finger. Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat. I don't like to show off. Lao She. Let up on the brake! Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks! Come one, what's wrong? Why? Legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow. The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones... "Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth." Okay, Shorty... see you in the morning... I'm going to have a little -- word with Willie. He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one. No. You don't like him do you? Just a statue. That's it. Pankot Palace. Nope, you got a little surprise over there, Shorty. It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story. Okay, Shorty. You got the tickets, Short Round? Step on it, Short Round! You're betrayed Shiva. Mola Ram -- you're about to meet Kali -- in Hell! That's far enough! Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination. That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for? Two are still missing. Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village. I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here. But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone? And it had three lines painted across it? The lines represent the three levels of the universe. I've seen stones like the one you lost. Was the stone very smooth? It was probably brought here from a sacred river. Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by -- What evil? I don't understand. What's happened here? Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857? Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi. It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen. Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond. The last Sankara Stone. Not quite. Yeah -- this time you're gonna help! Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them! Go! There's got to be another way out. No... they won't kill me. Yes, they believe you. Yes. I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation... You've got to go to sleep now. It's okay. You're all right now. Maybe... someday. Not today. I'm not leaving without those stones. I'm going down. Quiet! No... the heart's still beating! It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction. Willie! That's it -- the release lever -- look inside! A fulcrum release lever! GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around! Willie, open the door! GET US OUT OF HERE! WILLIE?! Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!! You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner. Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that! What -- the bug? You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door. Don't catch cold. I think you're too used to getting you own way, Willie... You want me so bad, why don't you invite me? You're talking to an authority in that area. I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" -- Wearing your jewels to bed, princess? No -- real food. Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way. Maybe he likes older women. I've always had a weakness for folk dancing. Any more complaints? He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants. Couldn't keep away, huh? I think you should sleep closer. I meant for safety. Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers. It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva. The drawing shows a priest named Sankara who lived centuries ago. Maybe... Yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years. Fortune and glory... I'd like to find one of those myself. What about the future? By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai? Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets. I met Short Round when he tried to pick my pocket. I know the feeling... That's good -- you're doing fine. What's happening? Keep stroking it! Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it! Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae. Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake. Can you move your arm? Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now. Don't let it curl around you! Don't let it pull you deeper! First of all -- don't panic! Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea. A what...? Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it? Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off. I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water. Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now. It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed... And then they took their children. It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village. That's more food than these people eat in a week. They're starving, too... He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down. The old man saw it in a dream. He told me they knew I was coming here. India... You all right? Get over here, damn it! Short Round, come on, grab onto me tight! Oh yeah? Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll? Siam. The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left! Poison never agrees with me. Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge! Don't get your hopes up -- where's the antidote? Relax, I've been giving him lessons. Look out, damn it, I need that antidote! No, Wu Han's an old friend I brought along. So, the game's not over. Put the antidote on the table, Lao. I like the service here.Meanwhile...? You crazy? Hit him with what? What!? I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway. Me? Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream! How you plan to do that? Bring him out of what? Me!? Why would anyone want to kill me?! You do? Who? I heard your ma went ape at the security store today. You look like the Prisoner of Zenda or something. How long's it been since you slept? Oh. Hi, how y'doing? Hello? Well what you reading it for? 'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'! I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens. They turn their back on it. Takes away its energy, and it disappears. Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song. They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills. They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right? You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming? Used to. Not anymore. Whenever I get nervous I eat. Yeah. So? Jesus, it's dark in here. Okay, okay. I think. Uh-oh... I believe in you, me, and Rock and Roll. And I'm not too sure about you lately. One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it. No. Slept like a rock. Haven't slept, have you? Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet? You okay? What the hell's going on!? Who was scary? Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway? So we'll guard her together. Through the night. In each others' arms like we always said. It's just a stupid cat. Jesus.Sir, the shields... Non- responsive. Nothing on my scanner, sir. For an instant... A scout class vessel. I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it. Still no response, sir. Admiral, there is no response from the Grissom on any channel. Aye, sir. Nothing. As before. Sir, Starfleet calling Grissom again. A warning about us. Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir. Sir. Commander, Starfleet on emergency channel. He orders you to surrender this vessel. Message acknowledged. All units will be informed. Shall I alert Dr. McCoy? Will we get another ship? Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there. An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...Thank you... Sir ! Not from here, no. Why don't we beam it up? I don't believe it... It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...! I'm sorry, sir. Just don't surrender. Genesis doesn't work! I can't believe they'll kill us for it -- I went wrong. It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours. Hello, sir. It's David. No!... I'll do it. Give me your phaser. Whoever they are, they're getting closer. I still don't... I don't understand. Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable. I'm sorry. The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now... This planet is aging in surges. If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never! My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands. It was the only way to solve certain problems -- I used protomatter in the Genesis matrix. Not exactly. Why don't you just call for help ! How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet! You mean, we're stranded down here?! Saavik... My god, what happened to them? Later. Let's go... What is it? Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise. They were fruitful, and multiplied. . .. Spock's tube... We're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms! I'll handle that later. Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've got to find out what it is... There shouldn't be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix. Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement. Short range scan. A photon tube...! There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan. Underground deposit? It's a little early to celebrate. All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk! It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic! Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four. This is where the fun begins, Saavik!Scotty...? Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu. Could be Grissom. Patch in the hailing frequency. U.S.S. Grissom, this is Enterprise calling. Come in, please. What did you see, Chekov? Bones... Can you give me a quadrant bi-scan? Keep trying, Chekov. At regular intervals. What's Grissom up to?... Will they join us, or fire on us...? Chekov, break radio silence. Send my compliments to Captain Esteban. Response? You did great, Bones... Just great. Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now. No reply, Chekov... Continue on course... Calm yourself, Bones. Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge. Yes. He has a long journey ahead. I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait. Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed! Mr. Chekov -- ? David, I don't understand... David!... What went wrong? David... Sorry I'm late. Bones, help Spock! Everyone else, find a station! How many more? What's wrong? I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks -- Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up... Good shooting, Scotty. Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass. Mr. Scott, all power to the weapons systems -- Scan for vessels in pursuit! The doors , Mr. Scott! Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott. Gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. Stations please! Mr. Scott? Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally. My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not. Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas. Be tolerant. Mr. Scott... Your reputation is secure, Scotty. Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters. Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four? Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again? My God... And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock? But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for! What? What are you saying? Goodbye, David. Is there anything we can do?! What happened...? This Vulcan -- is he alive? Saavik... Is... David with you? You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?! Yes, yes, Spock... Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many. You would have done the same for me. Yes. And I know you. Mr. Sulu, you're on manual. Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in. Best speed to Vulcan. Mr. Chekov, take the prisoners below. Go, Sulu! Come on! What about surface life signs...? With some on the planet... Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey? Fire, Mr. Scott! Red alert, Mr. Scott. Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say? That distortion is closing rapidly... Opinion, Sulu? See! That shimmering area. What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov? Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott? Mr. Scott: as good as your word. Warp Speed, Mr. Sulu... FULL IMPULSE POWER! I'll need it, Sulu. The word is no. I am therefore going anyway. She's to be decommissioned. Very well. Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please. Will you be able to handle that...? Good evening, Commander. Everything ready? That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd stay there... They say it's exhaustion... We'll see. My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs... Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control. Hmm.. Very odd. Scotty. Progress report? Uhura, any response from Starfleet on our Project Genesis inquiries? You're right. Thanks for the drink. Yes... I hear you. I just had to try. Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, please ! I can make them understand!! Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship. As surely as if it were my own! Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help... Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility. Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage -- May I ask why...? Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began! But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis... Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise -- Indisposed, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral. Don't be a fool -- give me your hand! Give me your hand and we both live. If we don't help each other, we'll all die here! You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself! Beam the Vulcan up -- And we talk. But, why? You should take the Vulcan, too. No tricks. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Kirk out. Commander, Klingon vessel. Stand by to board this ship on my next signal. All right, damn you! All right! Give me a minute to inform my crew. Wait! Give me a chance -- David?... David! Who is this?! How dare you -- Torpedoes coming in -- ! I say again: Grissom, this is Enterprise. Admiral Kirk calling Captain Esteban or Lieutenant Saavik. Come in! If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul. What I have done, I had to do. What about Spock? What you ask is difficult. What must I do? Bones!... Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?! Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way! But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated! ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes. ... Spock... ... The needs of the few... ... Yes... Yes... Of course...! Then, how -- Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me! But -- why? Yes, I was... I -- saw no future -- Then you know how bravely your son met his death. Sarek... I would have come to Vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies... Ambassador, I -- I had no idea you were here... I think you know my crew...But at what cost? Your ship... Your son. I am not sure. Only time will answer. Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is -- You will find a way, Kirk. If you honor them both, you must . You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace... One alive, one not. Yet both in pain. Yes... But -- how...? I see... and I understand. Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn. Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near. I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper! ... Or the one. ... The needs of the many outweigh... He asked you not to grieve... ... He spoke of your friendship. Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind? He would not have spoken of it openly. Because he asked you to! He entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. He asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his Katra. His living spirit. Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan. You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him. "Met his death"? How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future! Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report. I will speak with you alone, Kirk.It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters! The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir. We are clear and free to navigate. If I read this right, sir, we have full power. Close... There -- Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly... About a dozen officers and men. Klingon Bird of Prey, sir! She's arming torpedoes...! ... A cloaking device? I think it's an energy form, sir... Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in. We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant. Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed. Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space. Aye, sir, Warp Speed... ... We have cleared Spacedoors. Count on our help, sir. The word, sir? ... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise? On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit. Recognize this? Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground. We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? Shermin!! Shermin!!! What? No deal. You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us. No, we don't. We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear. You're not hearing me. Washington thinks it's too late for that. We have a new directive. I'm taking over. Shermin... You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy. Is that what's affecting your performance? So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that. I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air. We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions. I'm gonna be here if you need anything. We don't know what else to do. We need results. Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed? I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk. Oh shit!!! Clarify that. Why did you let it get into a populated area? It's in a green Mustang? When can we expect containment? You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck. We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time. We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for. We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact. Contain it and get back to me. I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need. Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin. Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken? There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure? Watch it. They're coming out. Okay... You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now. This is George Fox... Mrs. Haydn...They must have picked it up in space. It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes. Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? You have no conception of this, do you? Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. I'm telling you they're probably friendly. Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything. It was a man though... right? It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it? Yes. Twenty-eight years. It was only an accident that we discovered them. We better get it into the box. Come on... I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be. After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive. No, sir. Radar. We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared. Wait'll you see it. No. Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going. Very beautiful country up here...I just retired. George... Do you hear me, George? I'm afraid we can't let you go. You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that. Then you're going to have to do it without me. That's the chance we have to take. You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him. I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you. We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time. What's all this for? Hello George. I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it. Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is... George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal. I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared. You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay. It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... I don't like it, George... You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over... The extraterrestrial now looks like this. It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband. It's taken on a disguise. Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere. Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang... George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial. Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone. That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us. Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming? Then it's not an accident that they found us. What do you mean by 'contain?' Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing? We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here. Neither did I. None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva... I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and... It's real, George. Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells? Mrs. Haydn... Do you know what you were kidnapped by? Marc Shermin. Get a highway patrol unit over there. Is the man who kidnapped you there now? You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home. This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn? You get that, Lyman? Tell him I'm not here. Doesn't make sense. Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed? Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature. Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that? Give it a rest, Lyman. Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. Get Fox. It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman. The police think he was high on drugs... Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'... How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet? I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday. To the same woman? You married, Major? I know, but... There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident. Oh, Jesus. People have made mistakes in these situations before. It could have been anything. Was there visual contact? There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then... Can you see under the faceplate? Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that? This has always been my favorite time of day. We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now. I wouldn't think so. You saw that? Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that. Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George. All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you. We can't let you do that. Hello...Thank you. It is beautiful. No. No. Eh... yes. I make maps. I understand. Goodbye. Tell the baby about me. No. I love you. What do I do now? I must go. Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. I will wave to you. The yellow one. There. No, thank you. Many, many days and nights... You want the baby to laugh at me. If you want to keep it, you can. I will say that we can be friends. Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions. I understand. This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this. Yes. Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know. I want to get money for you and the baby. I know how to gamble now. I understand. Thank you. I want to gamble. May I have twenty-five cents, please? The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling. You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. They are beautiful. I gave you a baby last night. I understand. Do they talk?! No. Horses. What? I do not get cold. You are cold. I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go. I used the last one to jump off the cliff... You can stop. I will go on alone. You promised. You promised you would get me to my ship. I can't stay on this planet. The cook. Asshole!! I feel better if I move. I must meet my ship. I don't want you to be hurt. I will go. But not you. If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back. I told you goodbye. Why are you here? Are you angry at me? You can have one. The machine gave me two. Should I put one back? On the radio they say it's good. But I have never seen this before. I am not complete. You liked my singing? I am not a good singer. I do not want to. Yes. Not all... but it feels like a kiss. I like this music. Why? I am your friend. Are you my friend? He will. What is hell? I understand. He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship. I don't understand 'friend.' The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed. We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship... Yes? We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars. No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and... It was a mistake. I was afraid. What? Please stay. Jennyhaydn. Goodbye. Go? Yes. Can I have the gun? When do I get to Lathrop Wells? The car will stop? 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' Yes. 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? I do not speak English. But I speak English. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? But I must go here. Why? Why? Do you have a baby? A baby is a new person? Is that a baby? When we get here. No. No. No. I need you. Three nights... two days. Yes. Day... night. Yes. I do not understand. My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home. I will see it next time. It was yellow. What? Horses. Shit! I want to try it. I... What is... ...Coke? What? Money. No. You. Mouth closed. No. Who? Shit... shit... what shit? Shit? I am husband? Who? No gas. Gas. Space? From? I am... Jennyhaydn. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you? What? Closed? Go. Gas good? No gas. Minneapolis... good. Minneapolis... Minneapolis... What?! Smile... good? What? Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money? Money. What? Pancakes. What? What? What? That way. Good. Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard... Police... What?! Dashboard. Gear shift. Steering wheel. What. Ah no. What. Please... Please. Please... No. I don't understand. I don't understand. Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English. If I talk to you, I will miss my ship. I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home. I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.There's another one we owe 'em. Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car. You wanna take the chance, Casper? Nothing to apologize for, Casper. You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight. Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--? They'll be worried. There's a Harley behind those bushes. Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula. We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it- Arachtoids. From Planet Ten. It's an antidote. A formula. Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises. Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it? I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look... Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks. Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor? I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case. Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher. See 'em? They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield... We will, old fried, we will. Arachtoid. Just 'grazed' you, huh? You okay? I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne. The deuce you say. That crate! That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals. Go back to the bus and reroute the call. And his soul black as the Ace of Spades. Have you warned Professor Hikita? Then what? Same one you had yesterday? I'm starving...somebody, help. All accounted for? Where's Penny? Whorfin? Does he know we're coming? Dead. Damnit! What is it, Tommy? It? Who does? Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body? Let her out. In my custody. I'm sure we'll find out soon enough. Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay? Not really. This is pretty important. Anybody we know? Now! Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we did it! Pull up! Does this thing have guns, John Parker? At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--! The door's locked. What is this thing? A fighter? These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker. But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow. And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out... Got a casualty list? John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall. Don't shoot! To get my guns. Stole his body? When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What else? Orson Wells? What about Doctor Lizardo? What? How do you know that? Figures. Anybody seen my scope? Penny--?! Are you all right? Stay here, I'll be back. It's too dangerous. Absolutely. Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself. Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right. I gotta go. We're on borrowed time. Never. I wish he was. He's real enough. She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night. You don't wanna know. Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here! Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight. She was killed, Penny. Open up or I'll shoot it off. You keep an eye on it. Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have... Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me! Another 'you'? Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody? Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you? No, I don't. Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance? I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me. She was the Queen of the Netherlands. Who? Pretty terrible shot. Who were you really trying to kill last night? I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness. Everybody okay up here? This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck. He offered you money? Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong? Did you say..."Peggy"? Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name? Raise your hand...where?Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar. It's unusual, but no cause for alarm. Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem. Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command. They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed. No, sir. I think the flint...I'm not surprised, the company you've been keeping the last ten years. I own the place. We don't seem to be communicating-- ...So what're you doing tonight? So how long have you know Meurice? You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is. Listen, I got tickets for the Oilers and the Rams next week in the Astrodome. Ever sat on the fifty yard line? Give Debra here another drink, and give me the usual. You've got a very sophisticated palate. If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra? What're you, a fucking marriage counselor? ...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing. Then what'd you come here for? Fine. Suit yourself. ...Having a good time? I don't particularly want to talk to you. What "what"? ...Count it if you want. Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways. ...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine. Of course. Jesus, I don't believe it... ...What did you do with the bodies? Dead, huh? Got something to show me first? Listen, what is it? Is it done? Yeah... ...What? Yeah. Is it... ...What? ...There's a big-- For the money. So, uh... this wouldn't interest you. What do you think? I didn't say that. Well? Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here. It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get. It's not strictly legal. Got a job for you. Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over. No. It just made them feel better. How long did you watch her? You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for? What did you take these for? ...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar. Meurice... No. I think I'll stay right here in hell. The point is we don't serve niggers here. That's not the point. This. What's this? Deuce in the corner needs help. Don't throw that out. Pour that back. Red Label. What's this? How would I know? Has Ray come in yet?You don't look too good. You sleep last night? ...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead. What?! Did Ray tell you that? ...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved. Abby... ...For you I answer the door. If you wanna stay here, that's fine. But I'm retired. Well I do... Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink? Abby. What's the matter? Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday. It won't? I am? Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from? What night is it? Hold it, hold it. What's tonight? We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty. Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty? ...I thought you were dead. Going home? Where? ...I'm very careful about that. What's the point? Jack Daniels. Don't worry, I'm paying for it. What. Right. Right. What. Right. Sorry. You said the usual-- I don't know, didn't he call? No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night? Yeah, I know. Pour 'em short. ...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility. You shouldn't have taken the money... No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar? For what? Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office. Wasn't too busy. You missed a good one, though. This white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... I tell him to get lost, but Marty's sitting here listening and I can tell he's thinking that maybe it ain't such a bad idea... Howdy stranger. Tuesday night is ladies' night. All your drinks are free. Tuesday is ladies' night. What day is it today, Angie? Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT? Enough to light Las Vegas for how long? How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but-- Where was I?I think someone's watching. With your gun?... What do you want to know? Isn't that what you want? In the trunk. All right... ...Who? ...What was that? ...That's what's important. ...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker? Abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you're gonna shoot him. And when you shoot him you better make sure he's dead... ...Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart. I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important... Yeah. ...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads. Yeah. I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right? I said you're bad. You're bad. Abby-- I don't know. I better get off now. I don't know. It's early... I love you. Abby... you all right? ...You ever get tired? ...Mm-hmm. Thanks. What'd he say? Uh-huh. ...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly. Yeah? What happened? ...Well I'll be damned. ...Huh? Door's locked. Nothing there. You wouldn't be putting me out. You can sleep on the bed if you want. If that's what you want to do, then you oughta do it. You, uh... you want the bed or the couch? Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he? On the phone. Was it for you? Who was it? I just gotta see a guy. See a guy. You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there. Why d'you wanna leave all this? Your husband. Yeah. I want that money. If you wanna tell me something, fine-- You owe me for two weeks. Well... if you're not gonna fire me I might as well quit. Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What? What's that? ...Why? Got a problem, Meurice? Thanks Meurice. Is Marty here? Meurice. Sorry I didn't show last night.Nah, I trust ya. ...it's too damn risky. I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder... Nobody knows you hired me? Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful? It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better. So it would seem. Just the ten thousand'll be fine. ...What kind of fish? Ya catch any fish? Ya catch any fish? Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money. I want you to go fishing. The money. Yeah. That's a right smart of money... I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you? I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple. You're an idiot. Well what? You want me to kill 'em. ...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret? Yeah? Well how irritated are you? If the pay's right I'll do it. ...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it. ...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love-- ...Anything else? Now that don't make much sense. Most of the night... Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit. ...Just doin' my job. What do you mean...The Emperor's blade. Let him stand free! Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives. Let him stand free. Don't you trust your own eyes. You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck. Things have been so serious here lately. Would you really have drawn my blood? Is this what you seek? What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck. I'm sorry Gurney. Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood. You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan. How little you understand. Yes... Someone started another thumper.... We're not alone. I know the secret. The worm is the spice... the spice is the worm. Cinnamon... the spice! Do you smell it? Run! Remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper. It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come.... I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows. Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them. You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach... I'm something different, something unexpected! I'm a seed. I am so much more... You don't begin to know me... You carry my unborn sister in your womb! The spice! It's in everything here. The air, the soil, the food... It's like the Truthsayer drug..... It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness. I can see it... I can see it. Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/ Where are my feelings... I feel for no one... The South Polar regions... the forbidden area. We must make it to that rock... I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock. Maybe that small rock. Remove her gag! Don't touch my mother... What does she fear? What about my Father? Liet? Spice!... pure un-refined spice! Why do they come? Always? Will we see a worm? No one. It... seemed the proper way. No. He's hiding something. Are you a Fremen? Long live the fighters! We surprised a band of smugglers. My own name is a killing word. Will it be a healing word as well? The most lethal poison in the Universe. Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream. A treasure. Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib? What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon? SILENCE! Don't try your powers on me. Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But... I will never be yours. Did they try and fail? MOTHER! Tell me! Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die! I've heard enough of my safety... What about my father?... I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he isn't! Did they try and fail? I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried... Where? What is it? Not all of them... I know which ones will. I see the truth of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER Could he be the one?... Maybe... but will he be ours to control? You know when people speak the truth? THE PAIN! I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling. It burns. Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal? The Voice again. What's in the box? I know. But if it is a trap then why are we going? The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor. -- THUFIR You will make a formidable Duke! My father sent you to test me. Music then? I'd know the difference. I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.Maybe it was just an accident. Is this Nigel's doing? No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains. Western Europe. I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.She's right. They'll string her up. No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs. Turn it against her. It's her shadow-self! Her dark side! She has hostages. Yes. Just one kiss. For old times' sake. Before you go... Wait. Don't leave me. In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there. I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring... She'll forget about us eventually. Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available. Hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. And maybe something might. happen again. What do you think? But what if---it wasn't real? You think so? And now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike... What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song... I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it. I'm not mad at you. Hi. That makes it worse. Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said. Away. From you. Like turning off a light. I don't love you any more. She said it wouldn't last. Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and--- You can't just abandon me. Alone. It's paradise . We could be very happy here. Terrific. If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school. You're not afraid are you? Let me kiss you. There's one sure way to find out how you feel. What do you feel about me? You don't like me? You hate me? Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e. Why not ? I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives. I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news. Let's talk about us, not her. I used to work here summers when I was a kid. Come on, let's ride. I'm sorry, I don't understand. Where Superman's from? Krypton? Like it? They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre. This is my favourite place in the city. I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower. My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms... That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you. You're alive! She didn't kill you! When can I see, you again ? Don't leave me. Let me out. I have to talk to you. What's happening? Wait...don't leave me in here... I did. I'll mention it upstairs. A little. Hmmm? Why the empty cage? Well...I guess I can't. Supergirl? I don't know. You seem afraid. Yeah. You vicious-- If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again. I'm wise to your tricks, lady. No! I don't want your help. Nurse! Help ! Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion. Why should I believe you? I know it. They think I have a concussion. Oh no, not you again. I'll drink to that. Well, just one. What is it? What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire. I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service. Well, there's several ways to go .What? Me? Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner? No plans for the weekend, Linda? Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here. What can I do for you? Don't you believe in knocking?Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much. It is beginning to rule your heart. You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power. You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena. Nothing's wrong with my skin. ...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that? You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft. I have to talk to you. You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning. Balefire on you, Selena! You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate. Cigarette? You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over. You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville. You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations. You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months. It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them... It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three. I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other people come second. It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff.... I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone. You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon. It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you. You see, a tree is a living thing. Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this. Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in outer space. And we're in inner space. Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school? It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went. It's going to be a tree, I think. Goodbye... Too late. Too late. Save yourself. Yes, mustn't stop. What's that? Never saw anything like that. You can use the wand. Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring! Going to try. Didn't say I could. Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they? Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth? Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question. No, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. A thing like that. No. Sure you don't want a sip of this? It's delicious, I think. No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it. But it's impossible. There is a way. No, that's not true---there's well...no-- There's no way out of the Zone. No one's ever escaped. That's why they send the criminals here. Of course, my dear. What can I do? Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad. The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools. What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time. No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness. What? Palace? Hardly. Criminals. Well, nothing we can do about it. Come into my house. You can stay with me, until I build you your own place. I expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people. It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces--- Shouldnt've done that. Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself? This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?Compared to me she is. How come you're not at the cash anymore? They catch ya steal- ing? That's none of your business. What's it to ya?Cover...our footsteps... Sarah. I don't think I like this. What are you doing? Ticklish? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said... It's better that way. Pain can be controlled. You disconnect it. No. Never. Someone? Good fighters. No. I'm not. If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one. Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed... Not possible. My whole life has been combat. Hot dogs? That's good. Now, seven more like that while I make fuses. Make sure there's none on the threads, like this. Now screw the end-cap on...very gently. Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable. I learned howto make it when I was a kid. Later. I'm going out for materiel. Keep this. Is this enough? I'm wrong here. I wasn't meant to see this... Let's go. Time to move out. That's not my mission. Tactically dangerous. We lay low. That's the way it was told to me. Molecular-memory. What about it? Why? What's that? Bag some Z's? About what? Sleep. It'll be light soon. Good field-dressing. John gave me a message for you. Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you. For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will. You must be stronger than you imagine you can be. You must survive, or I will never exist.' That's all. You'll learn. Ow! No, it's okay. It's better tight. I'm sure. It was an honor. A chance to meet the legend. Sarah Connor. Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid. When you were in hiding, before the war. I volunteered. John never said much about him. He dies. Even before the war... You trust him. He's got that strength. You'd die in a second for John. What? It's okay. Forget it. I caught one, back there. White light. Pain. Like being ripped inside out... slowly. Like being born, maybe. Kyle. Come here. You cold? Hunter Killers. Patrol machines. Build in automated factories. Most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal. Didn't see the war. I was born after, in the ruins. Grew up there. Starving. Hiding from the H-K's. Defense network computer. New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination. --everythingis gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here. There. Nobody knew who started it. It was the machines. There's so much... Listen. Understand. That Terminator is out there. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead. Right. One possible future. Four your point of view. I don't know the tech stuff. No. Not yet. Not for about forty years. Pay attention. The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy. But these are new. They look human. Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him. But outside, it's living human tissue. Flesh, skin, hair...blood. Grown for the cyborgs. No. But you will. It's very important that you live. I'm here to help you. Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416... Do you understand? Who is in authority here? Then why am I talking to you? Get out. You've heard enough. Decide. Are you going to release me? Most official records were lost in the war. The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother. Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures. The Terminator was just being systematic. Surrounded by living tissue. I didn't build the fucking thing. You go naked. Something about the field generated by a living organism. Nothing dead will go. Can't. Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me. ...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence. We captured the lab complex. Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through. They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it. Yes. SKYNET. A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics. A modified Series 4800. With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
