Yes? Yes, Courtney? You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. I never knew you smoked. You and...Luis? Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. Maybe. See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! Why? It's a plain end, see? So? Oh Jesus. I'm going home. It's a plain end. I think. What do you want, Courtney? I'm ignoring you. Is it a what? Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him. Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely. Yes, dear. Yes. J&B. Straight. You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump. Is that Donald Trump's car? Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember? Eight? The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight. Nice? I'm thinking Dorsia. Courtney? Dinner? Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed. Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York. Pumpkin you're dating an asshole. Pumpkin? Am I confused or were we talking about tonight? You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when? On a lot of lithium? Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight? Listen, what are you doing tonight? It's not that nice. Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. Here. Really? So, you're looking great, how have you been? Nothing like last time, promise. Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap. Do you take American Express? Do you want to come to my apartment or not? Would you like to see my apartment? I haven't seen you around here. I have to return some videotapes. I'm just leaving. I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. You're just not terribly important to me. We never really shared one. Yes, I am. I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them. I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. It's over, Evelyn. It's all over We need to talk. My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs. I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. It's not. No. I'm not. Why should I ? He has a great body He's good-looking. He's rich. Why don t you just go for Price? Hi. Pat Bateman. Because I...want...to...fit...in. I don't want to talk about it. No-I can't take the time off work. Is your Evian spiked? Evelyn? Do...what. Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?" No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the fifties. He was an interesting guy. Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality. How did you guess? I know her. I knew her. Nice. That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail. Picked them up from the printers yesterday You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . I won't...don't worry. But I think...I want to know what happened here. No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here? Are you sure? Doesn't he live here? I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place. No. No, you...didn't? Why not, you stupid bastard? It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible? Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very, very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can't make myself any clearer No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer. Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true. What are you talking about? Bateman is what? Carnes? Wait. But wait, Harold, what do you mean? What exactly do you mean? Yes, naturally. Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. What? CARRUTHERS I'll call you. I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes. What...is...it? Jesus lives, Luis. Commes des Garcon. No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken. Your compliment was sufficient Luis. Uh huh. Lucky, I guess. I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now? Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? Don't tell me...merchant banking? Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? Don't, I'll drink it. Leaving what? Ask me a question. Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card. I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine. New card. What do you think? Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand. Calm down. Let's do it anyway It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay. What? Maybe it's just the light. I'm not sure, guy, but I don't think dyslexia is a virus. That's not Paul Owen. Paul Owen's on the other side of the room. Over there. Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? See you then. Two at nine? Perfect. Oh really? That's great. Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock? Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight? Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps? Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! Just...say...no! ...to the office this afternoon. I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. What are I doing? Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch? Jean-I'm not- Hello? Jean, I need help! Jean? Hello? Jean? Thanks. It slipped my mind completely. If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you. You don't want to get hurt, do you? Yes. I don t think I can...control myself. I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special. Jean? What? What...No! Put it in the carton. Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun. Forget it. Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? Growing. I'm glad you said that. Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. Interesting. Do you have a boyfriend? And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway. You can always he thinner. Look...better. I'm on a diet. But thank you. Jean? Sorbet? They know me. Yes? You're dressed...okay. Dorsia is...fine. Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go... Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere. No, come on. Anywhere you want. Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want. Well, isn't this a coincidence. That is...if you're not doing anything. Would you like to accompany me to dinner? Jean? Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence. Can you bring Mr... Tell him I'm at lunch. Who? Ye-es, Je-an? What is it? Come on, you're prettier than that. I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something. Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? Just...say...no. Negative. Cancel it. When? I occasionally box with Ricky at the Harvard Club. Anyone else? Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages? No. I really don't. What? That's...that's too bad. Oh really? DAISY He said... He said you gave him bad vibes. Welt...it depends, why? I m into, well, murders and executions mostly. No. Flattering, but no. What do you think I do? Oh, can't, I'm afraid. Matin�e of Les Miserables. Listen, I've really got to go. I'll-Oh...Christ...I'll call you. Next Saturday? Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time. Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I've got to go. Thank you, uh... Victoria? Listen, if you could talk to them I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes. Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup? Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere. Well. Hello Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening. Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. No. Paul Owen. You're at Paul Owen s. Don't tell him you're here. Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. She's from...France. She's my...cousin. What do you mean, she was a hot number. Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. So who was he with? Where was Marcus? Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? He does? You're sure? Well, does Marcus have an alibi? But Marcus denied it? Marcus? And? But how? Where do you place Paul that night? I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet? Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them. Not in the mood, I guess. I'll be there. No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. Great, yes, I'd like that. Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. Well, I could he wrong. Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? What? I had a date with a girl named Veronica. God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes. Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a suspect? Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man. Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know. Don. Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. Call me Don. Absolutely, I'm 100% with you. Uh, no. There's one...down here. You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes. The earth just opens up and swallows people. Nothing. That's so typical, isn't it? I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right? Had his apartment been burglarized? Have you consulted a psychic? Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and- What? Oh. Hmmm. But...has anyone seen him in London? Well, maybe he did, huh? Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints? We were both seven in 1969. Don't you know this? No, he just hung out there. Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places. Hang...out? No. Not really. I hope I'm not being cross-examined here. He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet. Yeah...Yale thing. I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know. Well... No problem. No, I guess it's okay. Bad habit. Who do you ask? Thanks. Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building. Harvard. The Harvard Business School. Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October. Shoot. You sure? I can always get you a lime. Understandable. Lime? Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything... Not on "Page Six" at least. Well, what's the topic of discussion? It's no problem Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle- Perrier? San Pellegrino? Coffee? Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? So, what's the topic of discussion? Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... Just joking... No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that. You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry. Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. Shhhh...it's okay. Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. Speak up. Come on. Listen, what's your name? Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. You're not what? Qualified for anything else? Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? Gee, uh, that's too bad. Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job? Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? It's cold out, too, isn't it? Yes, it is. No, Owen. Yes, Owen? You like Huey Lewis and the News? Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. Another Martini, Paul? Cecelia is, well...you know So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it? Nobody goes there anymore. Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello. Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here. Oh yes. I'm very lucky. Oh well, you know. It's...it's...all right. I've been great. And you?I can't...I can't find a shelter Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. Al. Al. What am I gonna do? I'm hungry. I'm hungry I'm not... I'm so hungry. I lost my job... I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry.Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and � - you. He wasn't with Paul Owen. I checked it out. It's clean. Yes. Yes. Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure. I've questioned him. According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did? Suit yourself, I guess. But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before? No hash browns? Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. Not a big music fan, eh? And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? Let's see... That you were with- That's not the information I've received. Wait. That's not what I've got. Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December? Not really. I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence. I mean they want to get caught. Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think? 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? So...you hang out here a lot? Great, and thanks for your, uh, time, Mr. Bateman. Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all... Oh really? I didn't know that. Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late? Eerie. Really eerie. People just...disappear. It's just strange. One day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then... No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything. No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it. No. Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing. I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts- Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship? Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so... Actually, yes. His girlfriend doesn't think so. Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London. So was I. Anything else you can tell me about Owen? I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help. And where did he go to school? He had a yacht? Yeah. You know...hang out. Where did Paul hang out? Do you feel that way? What kind of man was he? Besides... the information you've just given. So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen? What do you mean...Yale thing? Yale thing? How well did you know him? What can you tell me about Paul Owen? You sure? Would you rather I not smoke? I know. I'm sorry. You seem...nervous. Pardon me, but are you okay? Nice. Very nice. Your address? Where did you go to school? How old are you? Just some preliminary questions that I need for my own files, okay? No, really. I'm okay. I think his family wants this kept quiet. The disappearance of Paul Owen. Oh no, I'm okay. KIMBALL. No, I'm okay. No. I'm okay. So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. Was that anything important?We're ready when you are. And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today? What's your name? That can be done. Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical. You know what that is, don't you? Trust me on this one. And this is Manray. You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me. Different. First things first. I have to know if Manray is up for this. I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money. No offense. Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. De-la-croix. Good morning, Cheeba. No costume. No blackface. Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan. Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother. I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work. You gotta be professional. How you sound? Mantan!! You have to start getting into your character. I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind. You're now Mantan. I would like to change your name. That's right. Money turns the wheel. Trust me. Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other. Some tap dancing, some singing. EUREKA!! Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street. Can I finish? Thank you. I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. Don't you people get it? We're in the 21st Century. Slavery was over four hundred years ago. All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. Folks always crying, white man this, white man that. Let's all grow up. Yes. And I say yes because who is to judge? Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? Who? Who can play God? Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored. I gots to go, it's my Moms. Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call. Hold on a sec, I got a call. This has to be a big mistake. Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address. Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut. I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from. I will not be held responsible for these revisions. These changes are not the way I want to go. This is an outrage. This is a sham. A violation! Dunwitty, don't leave. In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!! That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything? What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video? Besides, what does he know about Negroes? You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot? I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after. I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy." Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain. We think so. I don't know about that plantation angle. In the projects. Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's." Do we have characters? How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima. Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer. He has educated feet. Negroes would be in an uproar. Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air. Could stop us from ever getting on. Yep, you guessed it. Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire. Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky. Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. The Dusky Duo. Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat. Two real coons. I know we're way out there but it's satire. I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go. It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air. In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium. I know you're familiar with minstrel shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? HeeHaw? I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. It's right and tight. Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan. What is it you want from me? Some plantation follies? Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch? Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads? You want me to go back to the ante bellum days? I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want. I'm an oreo, a sell out? Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show? I'm a Tom? I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think? I've never been given a fair shot. ...to white? I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows. I don't agree. The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom. I would prefer you not use that word in my presence. I understand. But again, in all honesty I was not informed. C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late. That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance. I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator. Four minutes ago. I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until... I love you too, Daddy. Let's get him over to the bed. I didn't mean that, in life. Where do you go from here? Nuthin' I can't handle. The same old, same old. Trying to get my stuff through. Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back? Daddy, it can't be just because of that. There had to be other factors. That's what I'm askin'. How did you end up here? I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped. Daddy, she's younger than me. Pleased to meet you. It's been a long time. It's me, Peerless. I want to speak with you. He never showed it. Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it. So what's up with you? So he drank himself into a stuper? How long has my father been like this? Is that so? Give me the gun. I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU. And that's how you got me in the first place. Otherwise. I trust you know the difference. You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU. The first and only time. A big mistake. I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore. This is crazy. You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody. I know where I made my big mistake. I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you. Light? Do you have to be so damn forthright? Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up. Oh, is he? You getting jiggy with Mantan? That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so. How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out? Why'd you do that? How so? Is that good or bad? Thanks. The Jolly Nigger Bank. For what? What is this? A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing. What would their reaction be? I hadn't the foggiest. Who's side are you on? C'mon. You were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family. You gave your brother a shot. That's all anybody can ask for, an opportunity, a chance, a shot. He got his. Same here. What do you want me to say? Your life will never be the same. Just want to say good luck. I'm gonna slit my wrists. Cut my throat. For the love of Joseph. Which one is your brother? I've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. I'm a fair person, a straight shooter and I don't hold my tongue. Everybody up in here should know I had nothing to do with you being hired. Good morning, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Pierre Delacroix. I'm running things and this here is my assistant Sloan Hopkins. I wouldn't bet against it. My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. It was the principle. Dunwitty had to be enlightened. I was making a point. I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money. My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW. I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer. This is Cheeba. Manray better not be bleeding to death. I need him. After we're done he can do whatever he wants to do, until then, he's ours. And lose out on my money? The only way I get paid is if I get fired. And that's what I intend to do. Good. I'm going to need your support. You getting cold feet? The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons. Dunwitty wants a Coon show. And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air. Hence I'll prove my point. Not yet, but this thing will never get made. Manray was under our nose the whole time. How can this be? You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary. How did you know? Manray! What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this? Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting? David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas? Everybody just talk out loud. This thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. Could Don King be near? Good thing Sloan had my back. She's my rock. This was going to be a whole lot of work. Oh, is that what I'm doing? Hi, Mona. Yes, your name? Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping. You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up. Mantan, we got a show to tape. Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself. Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place? I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity. Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired. You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan. And now is definitely not the time to bitch up. You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost. Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing? What are you? A man or a mouse? Are you a punk? Punking out on me? In time. No joke. Serious. Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal. Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity. This is nothing. It will blow over by tomorrow. So they can be on TV. Not nervous? Relaxed? You feel good, not nervous? Can I kiss you too? Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you. I didn't mean it to sound like that. I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on. Soon. If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan. Not at all? Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called? You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me? C'mon, Mommy. Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done. From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off. I don't even know why you're still concerned over him. Daddy's not with you. I can't go all the way down south. Where is he? He said that? I'll be right over. Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something. To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons? I know what's on my birth certificate. You heard from Daddy? Mommy, please don't call me that. It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show. Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot. C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff. It looks delicious. Good luck, Jukka. Do a good show. This is a travesty. A debacle. This is a TV show, not a music video. How did you get this gig? Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES. I'M A NEGRO. Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!! A fiasco. A disaster. A boondoggle. An abomination. Yes, I know. Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before? Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before? Finland. Where are you from? Nice to meet you. If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news. I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice. The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier. From the gitgo, from jump street. They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together. Yo, DeLa, I just got the news from the CNS brass. They saw some clips from the pilot and they're rushing it onto the air. Yo, we're a midseason replacement, ordered 12 shows. We're on in 3 weeks. Didya hear what I just said, Yo? I seriously doubt that will ever happen. Didn't I tell you I know your people better than you do. But if by some miracle you're correct, I'm gonna invite them inside my house and we'll have a sit down, discuss it like civil human beings. We just punched it up a bit. Made it funnier. Calm down, please. I'm gonna leave you two creative geniuses alone. Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough. Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it? Do you want it that much. No!!! Just meet the guy. That's all I'm asking. Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director. You can have that. If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot. Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless. I just want you to meet him. Keep an open mind. I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video. To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job. Sleep 'n Eat, what do you do? That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout! He's off the hiz-hook! What are you talkin' 'bout? It's the move. Stay wid me now. We're movin' fast. What does everybody else think about this? And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity. Make us feel good to be alive. Ya first bad move. Projects been done. That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired. Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation. In Alabama. We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one. What's the setting? Who are the other characters? So what. We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that. No such thing as bad publicity. So what. Earlier you said singing and dancing. Let'em try. I will kill to make this happen. This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy." And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? Exactly! What are there character traits? I want you take it there. All the way to the edge and back. That's a great handle. Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose? Which one is Mantan again? Don't worry about that, that's my department. Now who do we cast? We need a star. Can Whoopi sing or dance? I'm feelin' dis'! I'm lovin' it. You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister. The name of the show? Word!!! Go on. Good so far. I'm wid it. Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right. Yes! Yes! Yes! I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week. I want advertisers dying to buy on this show. I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you. You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you. I need a mid-season replacement and pronto. It will be on the fast track. That's exactly what I think. I want you to create something that people want to see. Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans. You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles. This is a golden opportunity now. These idiots have to be led to the water. You got your head stuck up your ass with your Harvard education and your pretentious ways. Brother man, I'm blacker than you. I'm keepin' it real and you're frontin', trying to be white. Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk. The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave. The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter. The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son. And so on and so forth. It's too clean, too antiseptic... I'm telling you it's not. The material you've been creating is too white bread. White people with black faces. The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary. But that's dead. We can't go down that road again. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. NIGGER. I understand Black culture. I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix. Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word. I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word. I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right. Nigger is just a word. If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I. Forget it. I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff. You're hip. You know what's happening. I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me. I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting. Do you know what C.P. Time is? So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you? Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone? I'm sorry I'm late. ...exactly thirty-two minutes ago. Yes you! Let Myrna finish. We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing. Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy. I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings. Through the roof. But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead. I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.Always keep 'em laughing. Baby, you treat me so good. Peerless, you're a good son, I love you. You never gave me no trouble. In life? I'ma keep on living, having a good drink, got me a good young woman, make a couple of dollars and make people laugh. Haven't I always tol' you all nigga's are entertainers? The question is what are you gonna do, Peerless? Three nights Charleston, South Carolina. The truth is never let them seeya sweat. You do that, that's half the battle. Dem white boys giving you a hard time? Enough about me, what's happening with you? All I know is what happened to me. All that other mess I just file into the "life's too short" category. That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic. Because I had too much pride. Too much integrity. I wouldn't lick nobody's butt. Some material I refused to do. How did I end up at the third rate chittlin' circuit greasy hole in the wall in West Hell, Virginny? Is that what you're asking ya Daddy? I did. I'm not an alcoholic. I just like to drink. Purely for medicinal purposes. My game is still strong. No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic. Good woman. I trained her right. Pull up a chair. Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT. Son. Good to seeya. Good to seeya. Go away, unless you got my money. What do you want?Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent. Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players. Damn skippy. Good. I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. Meaning? What are you talkin' about? Why they gotta make my nose so big? Sloan never told us she had friends like you. Must be the pressure. You ain't happy about the green light? You'd try anything. I got first dibs. You get ya own stuff. Seconds and thirds, too. What's that? Certified ladies' man, huh? It's that bad, huh? It's all over my face. I'm not smiling. You might be right. My name is Manray, goddamnit. I don't believe it. Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met. What you did is dead wrong. Yeah. Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece. No. Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me. That's some big shoes to fill. Same thing Giuliani said. You sound like the media. Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready. I feel fine. Naw. I'll take the zero. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way. That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life? Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure. I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time. No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better. Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game. Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins." I'm more comfortable around my people. Tavis, thank you for having me. I feel a song a comin' on. Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time. And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather. Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter. My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother. My father's wife also became the mother of a son. He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter. Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. I don't know who I am. Dat's yo Uncle Ben. That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately. Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me. Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you? Using all dose ten dollar words? I slept too near where I fell out. I fell out of my bed last night. ...like fried and chicken... ...like macaroni and cheese... ...perfect... ...then what about... Around... ...not that time... ...yes she did. Oh, because on our first date, she let me... I heard ya lady is wild. I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner. ...dat's too much money. I can't 'ford it. I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... I thought you got rid of... ...to big. The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose. Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy... She hates dem. Tomorrow is her birthday and I want to get her something really nice, like a... Not her, the one with the little... Y'know my lady Lucindy? Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE! Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows. Go to your windows and yell. Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents. I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes. Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's? I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat. Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. No mo' "city slickers." Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton? To come back to our roots. We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem... This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat. I wuz leaving anyway, for good. I know I won't be your puppet. Don't try to change to the subject. So you say. Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top. I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP." I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass. Aw, c'mon. Did you ever sleep with DeLa? Oh, you gonna make me say it. Stop playing me Sloan. And? You leave something out? How did you get this gig? You look beautiful like that. Y'know what? My people love me. For what? He left. Not me. We can look out for ourselves. Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me? This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this. You down with Delacroix. Maybe I need to do a lot of things. Never read a book in my whole life. No, before my time. Gots no intention of ending up broke. Just a little something' somethin'. Sloan, I got it like 'dat. What else? The good stuff. So what's up with you? A lot? Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.A song a comin' I feel. Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper. Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle. How be dat? Ain't Jemima on the pancake box? Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut? You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity. You slept too near where you got in? ...like grits and butter... That's what I like about you and me. We git along... ...too late, maybe around... ...too early... So when are you comin' to pick us up? ...I heard different, thought that was... ...no, she didn't... No. That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. We should go out on a double date. ...aconite get it dat cheap. ...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round... Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for... That'll work. I just bought one for myself. Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose... Too bad. How 'bout a dress? No, not that. How 'bout... Oh her. The one with da big... You tellin' the truth. Give or cousins some of dem educated feets. Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan. Our Alabamy Home. Now we're getting countrified. We is Bama's. ...the big apple, New York, New York. And this is my very best friend Mantan.You can't make it. Then we've just got shit. What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day? The next day we just start over again. Nothing out there but ocean. Look again, asshole. It's a mirage. You are. It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot. I float. You sink. End of story. They're always on autopilot. Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave. They'll never see you. They're never going to see you. You're just another piece of trash in the ocean. What are you smiling about? They'll be back. Thank you for fucking up my life. Yeah, sure, what? That's death knocking, knocking on your door. Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door... Die tomorrow or die today. Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move. The sea is lovely, dark and deep. Look, just slip off the raft. The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm. Take a little swim. Sleep. I'm lost. Goodbye. They'd eat you if they could. They're laughing at you. Listen. You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die. What are you doing? You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft. Water water water -- Get water! You're putting off the inevitable. You don't know where you are. You missed the shipping lanes. If they can't see you, what's the point? No. No. No more water, you said. Going to die anyway. Do too much, I'll die. No water, no work. Thirsty. Can't. Need water. Feels so good to lie here. With what? There's nothing to fix it with. This rope comes undone, you're going to drown. Shit! Shit! Shit! Catch another fish tomorrow.The failures they remember. It's the successes they forget. Worse than Warsaw. So how are we going to get this place shaped up? It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles. And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what -- Sure. No. that was the last one. To tell you the truth -- you did. Well, not really, I -- Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient. Well, I do a little drawing -- They're harder to do than they look. Possible. So you did those wings? Okay. Sure. As much as anybody. No. There was an unavoidable delay. So do I. Yeah, a long one. I had it on the island with me. Had a package to deliver. I didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled. You too. It means a lot...that you came. I don't know. I really don't know. Great. Really. That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway. I didn't know what really being alone was. No one back here does. Not when you have no choice. Cliches, mainly. Don't take anyone for granted. Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last. The tide came in, the tide went out. I survived. That's the headline. I survived. The plane went down. My friends died. I washed up on an island. Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am. That about sums it up. What was inside? There was a coffin? My epitaph. Yeah, well...couldn't be helped. That's my sea anchor. My second one. Made it out of part of the sail. It keeps you from capsizing in a storm. In theory. And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day. Is that Jango? You have any children? I would have done the same thing. I know. I thought you might have. A few things came up. Or went down. Hey...hey...it's okay! A week, max. Okay? Okay? Malaysia. They're holding the sweep. Look, we'll do our trip as soon as I get back. I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt. No, it was great. Maybe a little overkill -- Yes there is. It's our dog. It belongs to us. I can't take him to work. Could you watch Jango? We're a little emotional here. It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting. I have to. Look, I love the puppy. I love you. But I have to go. You did? I have to go. I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub. You know, for when you travel. And for you -- I can't even keep fish alive. He is a cute thing. Hey, look at you. Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better. Four four. A record. Not if you work for FedEx. What do you want me to say? That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit? That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did? Got to follow the paper path here. I thought I did. Cold. Let's take a look. You smell like formaldehyde. Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you. Anything else? When's the next Jumbo? Terrific. Yours? I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg. Doc, I'm not on the island. I'm not on the raft. I'm alive. I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you. I just want out of here. Not to mention on me. Yes, yes he did. I most definitely say I am. But all that's behind me. I'm fine now. I am one lucky guy. Which I didn't have. All I ate was fish. That's solid protein. Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache? My favorite doctor. What's the verdict? Yeah. Sure. I used to drive one of those. A long time ago. No. Need some help? Just don't count 'em before they hatch. Really? True enough. No sacred chickens nowhere, so far as I know. But chickens? So did I. Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord. Amen. The tide saved me, Mom. I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next. I've got all this back pay coming. Why don't you let me get you a place in town? I wanted to come here. When'd you start working here? Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me. The place is falling apart. Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here... Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream. Look, I help take care of the place. You got my check, didn't you Mom? It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me. Mom, meet Jango. Can you find her? What about the sender? Kamal, you're breaking up. Can you hear us? Who's in charge then, where is Chinn? What's going on down there? Who is this? Where is Kamal? Thanks. For everything. I need to do it. Deliver this package. Then, I dunno. Not just that. Take your time. Use it. Live it. That's what it's about. Take your time. Digital laser readers. Wow. Terrific. Believe me I know. To life. What's it all about? It's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about. Hallelujah. To Wilson. I never thought it would end. Then it did. It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing. Forty-three days. Time I had lots of. I braided them. You should have smelled me. Want to see my raft? This is Amber. Her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack. I beat the odds! I'm most definitely not dead. And as I recall, you're the sick fucker. It's me. Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland... Right. Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia. Talk is cheap. Are we on or not? A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month. This was nothing like Warsaw. I held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal. You are one sick fucker. For the third time. That's why you're a gambling man. I'm from Arkansas. Tell me a story with Robert E. Lee in it and maybe I'll pay attention. Forget it. And never take. It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered. Baloney. I do see the damn "big picture." Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point. I was making a point. You fucked us over. Jesus. I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team... I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up. You what? Great. Terrific. The good guys won one for a change. Borrowed. I borrowed it. No please, join me. Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on. As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself. May I ask, where are you bound? Permission to come aboard, sir.Shut up. I don't feel like dying today. It matters. We do the best we can, that's all we have. Let's get a second opinion. Wilson? What do you see? It's real. Jesus. What's so damn funny? Shut up. I'm serious. I'm always going on about me, me, me. Enough about me. Your turn. Damn it! Don't be so negative! They're on autopilot. I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel. With Kelly. You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. Thank you God. Grow up, stop being such a baby. Other people get through a lot worse. If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize. But I have promises to keep. And miles to go before I sleep. And miles to go before I sleep. Got to fix the sea anchor. Use the sail. You quitter you quitter you quitter. No! Why do they have to die for me? Can't kill another one. Can't. Can't kill my friends anymore. You're beautiful. Marry me. Fix raft first. I'm putting it off. Moon's too bright. Polaris, where are you? Maybe I'm too far south. Survive today, that's the point. Wilson, do you believe this? Take the damn water. Take it, damn it. Take it. Do too little you'll die. Okay look, I know you're tired, I know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more. Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it. You've had today's water. Get up, damn you. Get up. Stay calm, identify the problem. Problem, rope fraying. Solution, fix rope. Save some for tomorrow.No sweat. Finish what you started. You haven't changed, Chuck. It's still you. You want that delivered, we'll deliver it. That's what we do. What, then? Deep, real deep. Being patient. Don't rush things. I get it. What? Digital laser readers. That's all there is. To life. Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke. I'm serious. The burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon... You've been over the line and you came back. You've been saved, hallelujah! To Wilson. When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles. You were how long on this? Must have taken a hell of a long time. Cool ropes. This stinks really bad. How about we go somewhere else? Hello. You beat 'em to shit, pal! Jesus! You're fucking dead! God damn! God damn! Chuck, it's you! Hello? Malaysia's tanking. We're meeting in ten in operations. We're on. Ninety five percent? Just give me the money now. I'm trying to help you here. There's Warsaw, there's this -- Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow. That's FedEx, that's women, that's life. That's why I'm running foreign and you're not. That's why you're not married and I am. We're warriors, not desk jockeys. We've got to be bold. You always want all your ducks lined up. But nothing's 100 percent. It's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. Hell, I'd take 40-60. Then roll the dice. You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right. Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while? So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go. Look, I'm sorry about your plane. But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis. For all those vacation days you got coming. I didn't know we had sailboats. You know what your problem is? You just see the packages in front of you. You don't see the big picture. What? Let Paris hold its plane? Let Memphis take care of it? Let somebody down the line clean up your mess? The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection. I'm touched. But I might not have. It was fifteen minutes late. How'd it go? What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?I'm accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property. Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance. I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion. Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins. I wish she was beneath me. Well, now there's something worth dying for. What do you think? They always say that. These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see. They love Reed and his inquisition! I think they hope to share in his disgusting profits! It's becoming the American way! That scum Joseph Reed... they're calling him the 'King of Pennsylvania'. The man's a budding Cromwell. He condemns rich Tories to death and then 'appropriates' their property for himself. Naturally, the pig hates me for every Tory I've saved. I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed. There, then, you can have sort of a normal life. Gates? He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack. George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain. I think you need to entertain more. Seriously! Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt. That can't be. Same old story. While they're strung out? Well, George, who were you? Well, truth be told? I was a pharmacist. Alexander? After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses! Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table... Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you. Your own aide! Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is. It may come down to us, or them someday. You or them. Cicero was right: was is 'a time when the laws are silent'. The army can survive without me. What do you think, George, shall I resign? It's what they want. It is. Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee. The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief. But trust you to do what? One side in Congress wants compromise; another glorious battle; some surrender -- some, of course, just want power and money. But if you don't mind my asking, George, what are your plans? Oh, they have reasons... there's a lot of confusion these days. Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring! Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion. Even John Adams voted against it... I've come to report that we've had a bit of luck! It comes down to leaders. If our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe; if they go into the forests with the troops, eat what they eat, fight with them, perhaps to die? The most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation. And a French alliance? Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then? Exceedingly. Besides, if I had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to Philadelphia for this congress, I could move a whole army to the moon! Over three hundred miles. I capture Quebec leading an Army by river fordings through Maine... If we don't do it, the British will come down Champlain, take back Ticonderoga and attack us in the spring. We've got to attack the British! Now! Have they put you in charge yet? Do we have an army yet? What is happening?Congress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods -- probably their whores! What does she see in them? Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid. Some say that Hessians are invincible. That's why the people trust you George. Without someone at the convention, who has the people behind him, everything will fail. Will you do it? George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them. Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention? Yes, I believe so. March on Philadelphia! Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war! Get them all! Sweep them aside! He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress. George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America. Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne! George, you must declare yourself with us or against us. George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold? No one knows... Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions. I am not conscious of it, sir! But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part! Sir, Arnold is a traitor. Sir, I think no such thing. Yessir. General Greene is here. There are two other divisions here. What are we going to do? They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant. Then, they start coming back to us. Are you going to keep him, sir? I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix. But, then I went to King's College. It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for. But it's what he said, just before they killed him: "I regret that I have but one life to give to my country." With pleasure... and an honor. Did you hear about Nathan Hale? General Washington, is there actually going to be a compromise, I mean, a 'deal' with England? Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear. Therefore, retreat. Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel? Delighted, sir. I'll be twenty next year, sir. We've got powder but no ball! Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!Unofficially, General Greene. Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army! The British army, sir! General Lee is detained captain... No officer is going to get these men to fight! They had the life crushed out of them on Long Island. At the most, perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost, then retire to protect Congress. Did God ever make such a pitiful army? If he isn't, then he's stupid. Well, I shall deny him to you! He is evil on earth! The man is a traitor! Understand? You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind! And, Hamilton? Greene? George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold... But the Hessians are there! No one can beat them! That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor! They are invincible! No, I did not. Really? Well, what the hell is a deist, precisely? What do you mean you're not a Christian? Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians... To assert the rights of our founding fathers! This country was colonized by Christians! This shall become a Christian revolution. Surely as a good Christian you understand that! A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see? Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man. That damned Arnold is here, isn't he? Did you know he lost all his ships? Outrageous and completely unacceptable. George! So good to be back! I understand, George. What can he do? The British have massive superiority. Spies from Quebec confirm that the British are sending an entire fleet down Lake Champlain...I feel the same, sir. General Lee, sir! My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette... Like flowers after the snow melts. Yes, I will write him and tell his ministers and the court. I rode here, on my horse. Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France! Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets. I only meant... I am. Then, I understand you too serve without salary. You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening. I expect any time now a ship load of supplies... Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take. I am serving without salary. I... they look both the same. Uh... none just now, but... Sir, please accept my commission from Congress... and... You must see this portrait of my beautiful wife, Adrienne, we had the most perfect little baby girl just before I left. Her name is Henriette... But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere. However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England. Vive la France! Vive l'Amerique!What's the difference? We already have black soldiers in our army... The British Army is right back there, across that river! Sir! I think it must be something else that detains General Lee. Detained by what? I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!? These men have suffered but I believe they will fight. I doubt Arnold will be afraid. If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country. They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country. It is; we need you George. Yes sir, it's a wise idea... Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform... I'm honored, but, reluctant to leave you. What the hell are we doing? Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again... But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner. Sir. No. We're all of us after something. It's easy for me to fight for the common man. My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday? And what of my daughter or son? I know what I'm after. But now, with all this talk about compromise? It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope. Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all. I mean, why would you want to win the war? You're not after glory, like Benedict... You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army. They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine. It's their nature. I'm with Captain Hamilton. You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer. Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me. Maybe I will let you down yet. Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long. You're being a little hard on them, don't you think? Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history. And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal... Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army. I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now. My father is an ironmaster. As was I. I was born with a limp, sir. The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway... I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir. Colonel Washington? Colonel Nathanael Greene, Rhode Island Militia. Yessir! We're leaving them?Cut those men down. Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial. Benedict, trust me to handle this. You go too far, Benedict. Couldn't you have appealed to Congress? The point being: he's also a candidate for my job. If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me. Have you heard? The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee. As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move. Perhaps Martha will join me this winter. There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga. There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships. And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God! Benedict, it says that I have gone mad! They're ready. Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything. Of course, we get nothing from Congress. They need boots, coats... we desperately need food. Exactly. We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard. It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half. Our plan is to hit them as they leave. I? You all know my history. We're so damned important! Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this? I hope I never have to believe that. Then, I need you. We all do. Without your victory the men would have no hope at all. The army needs you. Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict. Is that a fact. Go on... I want to hear everything. We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low. Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops. I've ordered him to join us three times. In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate. They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it? Sam Adams never did. Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that? After all you've done, it's unbelievable! Damn-it! You've given us a whole new season, Benedict! And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada. Arnold! Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns. Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British? They died well. Otherwise, they didn't do much right. But if we have war, the British will surely send their best troops: right now they have no other enemies. What's your frank estimation of the British? You seem pleased by the prospect. You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness. Patience, Colonel Arnold. Active personalities terrify these men. But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga... Well, what have you thought? Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth... You'd have money every year, so you wouldn't have to work. You can stay at Mount Vernon as long as you want... Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand? You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter. I want to free you, Wil. I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought. Wil... Yes, William. I am apologizing. What? What are you talking about? Misunderstood what!? None of the servants is to touch a gun! You know that! You are never, never to touch my guns! Do you understand!? Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer. Marquis! Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left... Who is that!? What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals! They are not cowards, sir! They are not afraid! What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!? Lafayette will not be happy... General Lee, welcome back. I'm happy you've decided to join us. You're asking me to be president of a republic, not king? Not a dictator over subjects? But it's more than just that, am I right? I'm not sure. Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there! Tell them I will give them my decision then. I want to address the officers, all the officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess? What's your advice, Alexander? Is this a coup? Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree? To hell with Arnold... This is a declaration of insurrection! Who wrote this!? What is this? I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect! Don't lie to me, Hamilton! If I had not court-martialed Arnold... Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair? Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!? You realize what would happen if this fort fell? The whole Hudson would be open to them! Colonel Hamilton. Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north. I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold. Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can. All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us. It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating. We better, Congress invented him. To learn to shoot cannon? They're among the best divisions the British have. No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers. That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy. Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness. It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on. And is that the most horrible thing in the world? I'm so inclined. No one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than I. But if victory is remote and there's any hope for a negotiated peace, we must keep this army intact. I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton. For Christ's sake, have a bath. How old are you, Captain? Then use rocks! Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross. Who the hell knows? Everyone's giving orders. It's all very democratic. The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill. With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it. Horatio! Horatio Gates, of course you know John Adams of the Massachusetts Delegation. Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went? Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand. What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here? Who are those people in there? The fat ones in silk? Lafayette is my friend! He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child. But he would have died before he would have let me down. If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them? Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent! I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief. I don't know: delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things. And, if he's popular with his men... As does your ability, Horatio. We must talk further, when it's more convenient. Well, John Adams, your cousin has a marvelous gift. Are you all going insane!? Benedict Arnold! The man who stopped the British on Lake Champlain! Who carried the day at Saratoga! Goddamn-it, Joseph, you own two mansions, ride in an expensive, Tory coach! You are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs! Arnold is indispensable, do you understand? I need Arnold to help me win this war! How can you say that? Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold. Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me? I accept your resignation. With regret. You have leave to return to Philadelphia... They help me understand why we fight. How many generals do we have like Arnold? He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights! They are also very religious. So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas. One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader... I mean, I'm a Deist. A belief I share with the likes of Tom Jefferson and Ben Franklin. Surely you knew that. No. As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. A grand scheme? Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges. In my opinion he saved my army. Colonel Reed... If we have any hope for a compromise or truce with England now, we have to hold on here: our men must believe they can win -- the British must believe that somehow, in some mad, impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them. My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold? He's up there. A fleet? Any word from Canada? I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York. Get these men back in line! My God! Who ordered this retreat?! What is it, Marquis? When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers. Because, if the British got off their asses and came up here, now, we would be smashed. And the revolution would be finished. Tell King Louis, it's that bad. Chose another. Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses. Well, we will accept these charming little gifts. When we see them. Meanwhile, please, take your pick of a horse. And how rusty are these muskets? These supplies...? 'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur. You must be very rich. No, please; an advance on your salary. The one with 'Philadelphia' spelled correctly is the counterfeit. 'Continentals', Congress' paper money. It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless. Can you tell which one is fake? Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress... Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis? What I want to know is sir: where is your daddy? We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with. I want you to see our hospital. Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people. Martha! For God's sake! Our 'kind'? What is that supposed to mean? These men are all I have left and they stay because they will fight! They desire it! They seek it! Of course Virginia is terrified! For my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the 'upper class' from the face of the earth! Should I tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me!? It is impossible for me to imagine that Negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free! If we win this war they will own this country too! Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending! What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't? To win this war I need an army. Martha... what? What else? From Virginia? I think I heard that. That's right... When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven. Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart. I was drunk on something then... "Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans? As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days... But, as usual, it will not go well for... them. Martha, you must trust me. Everything. If we force Britain into concessions it will open up the western lands -- and that would be a boon for our family. We already have more slaves than we need, but we need more land. The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule. Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small. The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy. Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long. You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize. Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen. I'm very aware of that. The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear: a classless world. Not a very real expectation. Of course, if it were that simple. These people? They're after something else... Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend. Surely you knew this was coming. It's another demonstration against the king. This is the wildest yet. You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire. I don't need to be in government. Well, this must be about something! They're for my bodyguard. I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated! It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think? Nathanael, I'm sending you to Virginia to head the southern army, to harass Cornwallis. Marquis, you must go with him. You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in! It's all right boys, I'm here! At one time I could have chosen not to be. I will not betray you, Nathanael. You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism? You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton. Yes, I thought that's how you'd feel, Nathanael. General Greene? I certainly didn't mean you. Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman. Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs. The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each! A horseshoer? But, you do come from a military family? It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene. Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight? Yes, yes, happy to meet you. They're finished, they can't help us anymore! They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours! We can't take them. Are you all right? Really? Which precious homily was it? I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world. I'd throw everything away for you. Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am. That's a lie! But not more than your comfort. You know very well who it is that I love. God damn you, Sam Adams! You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British! That? I hear a mob: unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs. Are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war? You know why I don't trust revolutions? Because each of us is who we are: we make speeches, print pamphlets, and we never change. The world is not a philosophical abstraction, Mister Adams, it's us. And, I don't believe you can ever change human nature. I see... Who says so? Just because they are born? That land belongs to the strongest.That's good... who? I'm lost in ecstasy! And dost thou love, Thou charming maid? They can use their imaginations. You're out of your mind! What are you doing? I think I will disappoint you. What else should I become? There's no difference between Virginia and England. I must be educated if I'm to take my place in society. My father couldn't afford to send me to England for school -- he made a shambles of our fortunes. Everyone laughs at me. Well, we must be who we must be... It's the freest land on earth. I think America suits you. I always though London was the place to be: capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth. Then why are you teaching me...? What do you really think of the minuet, anyway? Cranes? Who needs to walk like a crane? Or, 'civilized'. Sally, our slave system is a British law... Slavers capture them and bring them here. Africa, of course. William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff. Juba was a Numidian. This, this is life indeed! Life worth preserving, Such life as Juba never felt till now. Though, sometimes we get frost and that can cut the season.What have I got now? It's exactly as if there were two emperors. Because of this the people have two minds. He is their champion. Damn him! I should have killed him on the front -- I let you talk me out of that. Lykas, pick a man. Someone who will look good. Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action... Send them out! I am their hero! I want that bastard dead! Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger. Yes? Go on! But I get what I want, always, don't I? Now that we're done with that infatuation forever. Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena. The Gods know, I'm tired. Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating. What is that... wailing? You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers. Where have you been? I have to come back. If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward. Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand. Do you understand? Tribuus... tomorrow. Kill him! Tribuus -- execute that bastard. For the gods, spit it out! How about in the forum. Right in front of the Senate. It's disgusting! Animals! I had to come here under armed guard. Slaves -- get this junk out of my sight. I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house! If it's worth something then sell it! Let some time pass... then ask, quietly, without anyone knowing it comes from me. Did Narcissus die today? Wasn't this his day to die? I should at least have you, don't you think? They hate me, they really hate me don't they? Why? Then they'll notice when I'm gone. Well. I'm making a public appearance aren't I? Quite so. Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome... Oh, stay... Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory? Just remember, he is a married man. More wine, sister? Surely you can drink more than that. Will you please get back in your wagon? And stay there? We're nearly there, Lucilla. Endorse me in public. Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates. I know you would give anything to be outside again. Endorse me and you will be free. Think of it. What would you do with your freedom? The army is a problem. They love you. You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you. And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that? Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried... Cooperate and they will be returned to your estate. I could have executed you. They won't break this one. I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube. That this illness has clouded his mind. Being as close, I'm certain you've noticed what we all have noticed. You and my father have become very close. Perhaps one day I may say the same for us. Do we really need to repair this fort? It seems like an expensive undertaking. I propose we burn it to the ground. That way if the Germans cross the Danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position. I would say there's nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what 'right' is. Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political. Not a Republican by any chance? Or perhaps into a new one. But here's to your God and the courage of our legions... Then you'd be out of a job. That's difficult to say, general. Of course, but not now. However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me. Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas. My father sends his heart felt praise. Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather. I wouldn't know who to bet on. Take grain away from the army? Give away food? So am I. Maybe it'll crush Gaius. Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum. If it's my father they want then give him to them! At the opening of the month of Janus, I will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship... Gods of hell! This must cost a fortune! How many days is this going to go on? Ignore that?! The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better. How can they? Who else is there? I have no heir... Quintus will tell the army that you are being called to Rome to celebrate your victory. They will hear that you are living in luxury. He will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life. And soon the army won't even remember your name. Underdog! How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time! I'm the emperor why can't I kill him? He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident. This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power. I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans. He left us at dawn. I'm certain father will be in better humors by then. Now, honor us with your presence at dinner. I'll join you as soon as I see my father's physician. We need more statues -- perhaps I should open medical clinics. For the poor. Citizens only, though... Tribuus! Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia. Jerses -- tomorrow... Why isn't he dead? Damn you, you promised me he would be dead! Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed? Where is my father?If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you. Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again. On what charge? And my army would have thrown your body into the Danube. Where is my family? Apparently my opinion wasn't needed. Forgive me, Caesar, but do two Senator represent the mood of the whole Senate or the will of the Roman people? Besides, every truce we make with the Germans they break! We have to stop the Germans now! Caesar? You flatter me, Caesar. But they're not destroyed, not yet. The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care. I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician... Gladly Caesar. Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say. Do you expect Marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience? Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report. It's time for you to tell the Citizens that Commodus stole the money allocated for defending the German border. It's time to tell the citizens everything. Will you write it? Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company? The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates. He was born on August thirty-first, you know. My birth sign is Water Bearer, twenty-fifth day in the month of Janus. That's their job, isn't it? To argue. So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action. My only visits to Rome, Senator, have been through books. But the war's over, time to close the door of war once and for all. I've read of it. I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory. Thanks to Marcus Aurelius. The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome. God of my ancestors. I hope you live to see what I believe... The Senate too? We all know what right is, Senator. A republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes. At the core he's a man who believes in doing what's right. I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire. You don't know how wrong you are. I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing? When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen. You're hearing about somebody else. They can't... if this is Rome... Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial. Why you? Where are they? He killed his father and then my family... Would that Marcus had lived. "But what if I wish to be purple?" To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman. Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night. My beautiful daughters. Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something. If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something! These men here are butchered for laughs! Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line! You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist. Yours will do! I don't believe that. He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron. You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany. Why do you play at being drunk? I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job. Sneaking around with your brother? Only from a distance. No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day. I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power. They fear me. Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me. You're too hard on him. He is a strong young man, with you as his guide... So I understand. Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn. He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow. There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well. I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light. I will, Marcus. But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself. The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable. On my honor as your daddy... As soon as I can. Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can. Much more colorful than the ones we wear. And, of course, less dented. Can you stop that slaughter?! Can you free these men? Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators... Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate! It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons. You brought the army into Rome. On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here. The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me. I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort. Well, they die for it! Rome is going to pay tribute -- like a defeated nation begging for mercy? Have you told your troops that? What deal? Centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the Germans will try one last offensive. They've got nothing to lose and it's so very like them. Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation. What the hell was all that about? Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders. That's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm going to do... They'll have me. Teach them. Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans. Teach them, who we are! I'll never die. You tell the girls that. You honor our ancestors and I'll be there. Every night. At the table of life. Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered? If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you. How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power? A month? Half a year? Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time... When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family. You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia. What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done. Me? Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other. Quintus is overly idealistic. I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me. I'm a soldier -- we're at war. I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves? Very fancy. Did you design the bottle? This is our oil from our estates? If you win, you know, you have to stay. It's the losers who get to go home. Besides, I'm not so sure it is over. Centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines. I can see that... Of course... What about their philosophy lessons? Greeks? He's very realistic. Commodus must hate you. Free your gladiators and come with us. I want nothing to do with the arena. You were a soldier, and then a gladiator, weren't you? I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink. Before they leave, get gold. Then get a large cash advance. No. Tell them I'll do it. But I want more posters all over Rome. They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time... How much money is involved? Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth. Take my advice and make that bet. Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting: if this were a fair fight where would you put your money? Pressures on, eh Proximo? There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window? Spend my days beheading country bumpkins? I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home. As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!' So I pretend I'm dead. You get gold, what do I get? What the hell are you talking about, Greek? Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich... Lucky it didn't step on his head. Proximo, if this is her doctor he's an assassin. Alive... I'm alive... What would the poster say: "Narcissus would kill for a taste of Golden Pompeii Olive Oil?" I didn't get killed and everyone else did. I'm not a gladiator. I refuse to fight. I refuse to be your slave. I refuse -- Take your hands off me animal! Death is a very light thing for you. Thank you. What is going to happen tomorrow? Exactly? Impossible! Every citizen has a right to trial -- this is Rome! Condemned? Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned? Who the hell are you? I killed too many barbarians.You know there were riots last night. Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division. You understand what you are doing... AGH! Please! He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime. Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to? And don't tell me you don't know! Commodus... he's a gladiator... is he mad? This is Cos, this precocious young man. A scribe for the Daily Action. I've invited him to write a small piece about you... Are you mad? With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night! Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business. Something else, then. Do the chariot races interest you? Let's talk about this later. Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia. From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum. It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean. Rich soil. Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak. Was I? So, things change. The government has moved to the circus. You're going to fight last. And Commodus is going to fight first. I'll do it! Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything! Right, right, what am I thinking of? Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer. I don't want to get sued over this. Fantastic! Wonderful! But posters are very expensive. I can really rape them on this! Can I at least tell them you'll think about it? A great deal. They designed and build Tiger's chariot... Oh, shit. Take your time! Don't get suckered! This man is a murderer! In his career he's killed over a thousand gladiators. Please, just take the fall! On you! Of course! You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen! It's absolutely not like that! This is for your own good! Come on get the rest of your armor on! But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third! When I get paid... just take the fall! You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer! The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life! You get to come alive again in the country! You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood. Gushes out everywhere! It's really impressive. Fantastic! Better than the real thing! Tiger's challenged you and Jerses has made me an offer, made us both an offer: you take a fall. No more bad luck now! The people are anticipating you! I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman! The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome! It will be good luck for you to wear that helmet... It belonged to Cimon of Smyrna... he was crushed by an elephant. Don't be ridiculous. General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight. A fan sent them to you. Think about it! Just think about it! At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company. Small, but profitable. They asked if you would endorse their oil. We could get some very nice posters. Make some very big money... That's one way to look at it. General, do you realize what happened out there today? Then, you'll die... Just, know this: because you asked I asked: I'm sorry but... Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions! I'm proud to have you in my school! Now, show them what you can do! -- to fight? We'll see... Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here. I know what you're trying to do: kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands. The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual. You make me feel good about my investment! And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you. Both of you have clamped mouths! But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family. And about you. That I promise. Chain him. Death is... everything for me. Now you have to go to your cell, and I to dicker with Jerses... you'll be fed well. I want you to be fit as you can be; I want you to win for me tomorrow! I want all my gladiators to win and be happy! Besides, I've never owned a Roman general before. You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining. Romans like to mix their metaphors: laughter with their executions, you know? If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator. A gladiator at least gets a fair fight. General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen. I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate. I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me. I own this school and everything that's in it. You're in it! But why? What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets. Please, I separated you from the others because... ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons. I'm a Greek, thank you. And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians. Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white. Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend. You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...? and you act like one. What was your crime?That's what we want. Reaction. And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em. Let 'em riot, we can handle it. We'll be ready. I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that. Over the edge, in fact. What do you think? Dick likes it. We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by. They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing. We're called SDM. Sonic Death Monkey. We're not as bad as you think, Rob. No. We need the gig. We're getting that anyway. Laura said we could. If we helped out with the posters and stuff. And we did. And we are. HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector? I heard you, man. Don't give me that "what" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them. What the fuck is that? Yes way. It's really... The little skate-fuckers. Oh. Right. But I'd forgotten about that. I wasn't biting the idea. Haven't seen it. I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want." Whatever. Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it. Ooh. Drag. What's up? So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that? You're not even coming? How many tickets can I put you down for? That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But -- They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea. I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments. Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it. The band that found me and asked me to join. My band. Hey. Suck my ass. Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some. Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name? Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all. Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock. I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now? Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass. How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie. ...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it. Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to. Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone... "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you -- I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say? I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you. To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century. -- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit -- Ooh! A kind of recent record! Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that? Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all. Dick, did you hear that? Ehh. What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about? What are you snickering about? What? We can take your car. We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us. I didn't know it was classified information. I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy. ...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes... I wanna date a musician... Yeah. Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? You're going soft in your old age, Rob. There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. You're right, Rob. I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club? He offended me with his terrible taste. Bullshit. The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway. Why not have a little fun? Big fucking deal. "Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular? Oh, so what's the point then? We didn't even really have it. I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny. Rob. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's. Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins? "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?" Well what's the point in that? Great. That's the fun of working in a record store. Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it. Since when did this shop become a fascist regime? "Little Latin Lupe Lu." Play it. Don't you want to hear what's next? But it's my new tape. My Monday morning tape. I made it last night just for today. Public Enemy! All I'm trying to do is cheer us up. Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care. What are you doing? IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER. NO--! That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television? Do not get ahead of yourself. They always seemed what? They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed. They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums. I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane. Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain? It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD. Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables. But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album -- Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma? Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time. No, you can't. Oh yeah. We got it. -- It was Dean, you fucking idiot. Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean... He's not worth it! Anna Moss. Mossy. The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing. Is she all green and furry? Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda? Who are you going to see? Why? We work there! On Clark Street! You can be and are wrong. No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album. Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?" Bullshit. No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers? What? No. The Righteous Brothers. Holy Shiite! What the fuck's this? Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all. The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment? Oh, hi. "Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his -- Don't do it, Rob! Anna Moss. Anna. Nobody. I can't go to the club tonight, guys. You'd love it! A couple blocks! About six! He's got one! It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The." But I could be wrong. That's what I said. She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile." Nothing. I just prefer the other one. Nothing. Oh well. Nevermind. Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels? It's the new -- It's Vince and Justin. "Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one. I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's -- Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob. Well we rang $900 today. Do it. Do it. Rob --! Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now! Rob. I want a tape. Yeah. Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing? Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that -- I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously. Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight. I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good. So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing. I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff. 'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him. Are you all right? Can I help you? The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it? Well, I'll just make it for you. 'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though. I'll tape it for you. Yeah, OK. I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl. The one on Testament of Youth. Never released here. Japanese import only. Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me. Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate. You gotta be kidding me. Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high... Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend. Alison's. Do I know you? You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night. Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey. Sonic Death Monkey. You couldn't be. Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums. How are you going to cope with them? 110%. That's my final offer. I'm not kidding. That's how much it means to me not to hear you play. What is she doing? Okay, 20%. I'll give you 10% of the door if you don't play. Like fuck you are. So? You even said they're good. What? No way. Not really. Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat. Because it's in The Big Chill. Fuck off, Barry. It was Jan, and it was a long time after-- Laura. Her dad died. Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window. Of course I'm not coming. Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? Where is it? The fucking Bucktown Pub? Ha! None. Christ! Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there. Isn't it? That's why you got the gig, isn't it? You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown. Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance? You are not in a band, Barry. You are not a musician. And no posters. What band? What the fuck is that? Terrific. Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday. Shut the fuck up, Barry. How do you know about that? Ha. Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours. Why would they care? But in your opinion, would I definitely go? Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it? Just listen to me. If I said to you -- No, but would you think, from that one sentence. That I was going to see it? Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think? Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?" -- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean? There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. Yet. What does "yet" mean, anyway? "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean? It means you're going to go, doesn't it? Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer. "Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind. Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash. I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy. What do you mean, "what?" It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great. That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry! What did you tell her about the shop for? I wanna live with a musician. She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes. But now I kind of like it. It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's. What did he ever do to you? Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop. I don't want you talking to our customers like that again. Not the point. You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry. Nice, Barry. We'll do it next Monday. Since you brought that bullshit tape in. How can it be bullshit to state a preference? Say it. What's next? Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier. I don't want old sad bastard music either. I just want something I can ignore. I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now. TURN IT OFF, BARRY. Haha. Right. It's no problem. I love making tapes. Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape? Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them. Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there. Instead of "Sin City." Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl. Yeah. Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. So... I should really put a James Brown in there -- Sure, but is that it for the list? Is that it? Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone. A bit controversial, I know, but... Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so? What do you mean, four more? OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home. Oh boy... In the club, or at home? Pardon me? Yeah. I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it. What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young. You don't. You don't look old either. You look just as old as you are. A bit younger maybe, but not a lot. Not much. Just right. Huh. You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in. You must have only been about sixteen. Oh. Okay. Right. Why? Uh. That's me. May I help you? Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you? C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell? Huh? Why did you break up with me for Marco? Hey Charlie. Uh...yes, at the moment. Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you? Yeah, sure... Who's that? What is this. Can I do anything? You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it. Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole. Yeah but more than that. I'm happy because I'm proud of us. Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage. I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux. -- FUCK OFF! Liz, hold on a second -- What? Let's not. I always hated this song. I understand, Dick. Fine. Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that. Hey. Didn't you steal that one already? What's this? Okay. Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one. No, that's okay. Really. Great. Good weekend? 'Morning, Dick. I dunno. We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever. I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store. I dunno. Yeah. Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now. Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it. What needs sorting out? Can I help you? I'm an idiot. I should have played the record first. This place is about to get burned down. I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing. Shut up. I'm only trying to explain. This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else. I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time. Fair enough. Are you persuadable? I don't know. Right. Okay, then. Shall we go? Would you marry me if I was? Not in love, exactly, but... Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch. I mean it. I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me. I'm going to talk to you. Not really. I know. I don't get it. I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk. I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't. It's no joke. I'm responsible for what happens, you know. Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. I have to put down a deposit for the room. I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them -- Barry? Barry knows about this? That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time? You had no right. Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled? And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?" WHAT? Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this? You did that deliberately. You knew all along I'd like them. It was a trick. Ha. Oh. Well. We don't really get along. Paul and I. Where? Nothing. Hi. No use. You're being stupid. I'm alright. Harder. You're tougher. And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and... But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be? No, but... Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger. You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't. But it wasn't supposed to be like this. When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and... Fantastic. The Girlfriend Lottery. Hey, great idea. What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way. Okay. Oh, great... Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway? Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better. Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago? You know the difference. Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex? What it was like. C'mon. I want to know. Okay. Mission accomplished. What about Ian? So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together. Laura... Look, we can do other things. I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used? No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill? You know, with Ray... Hi. I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later. What? When are you going back? What do you want to do? Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus. What do you mean? I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all. Mmnn. Uh... No. Sure. I'll see you on Friday. Yes, of course. Do you want me to be there? Me? No, no. When are you going home? Who the fuck's Pig? Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better. Are you alright? God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed. Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh? Hey, how ya doin'? I guess I am. I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him. Okay, okay. I get the picture. Sure they are. Don't forget your CDs. You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it. You know I'm a good person. This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways. I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy." I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him? I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place. That bad, eh? You still together? Going all right? It was kind of funny. Those look heavy. Where's Ian? Is that the last of it? No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it. I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you. Think about what I said. I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever -- Are you still in love with me? I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are. You're running. On the run. You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him. It's me. You do, huh. I don't have your number. Look, I gotta go. I work too, you know. Nothing. You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff. The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. Ah. Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan. Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings. He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing. I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth. I guess. No, not -- I mean have you, you know -- Have you slept with him yet? Great... That's great. Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home. I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk. I'll look for 'em. How you doing? Hi. The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet. But not even before, when he was living upstairs? Never? I don't know. Of course it is. Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better? Is it better? You won't like it. It sounds stupid. No problem. If I can ask one question. Yeah. Great. Well if you could tell me roughly it would help. Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance -- So we have a chance of getting back together again. Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? It means he might live. Even if it's only a remote possibility. So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together? Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead? Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going. No. So. Is it working out with Ian? What, what? No. I don't know. Just the obvious stuff. I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of. Good. So. Is it my job? Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I? So. Where have you been staying for the last week? Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection? Not really. Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs? But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything. So you weren't interested in music at all? You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection." But don't you remember? Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship! -- Alright, alright but -- -- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in -- How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians. My house? Are you coming home? Hi. Shit! Jeez. He goes on long enough. Well stay for tonight, then. You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever. Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know? I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo. But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know? Enough, Liz. Isn't that how it is for everybody? Is Ray going? You're kidding. A crematorium? Jesus. So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him? Well she -- It's true! What's the -- hey, Liz -- Actually, I'm fine. I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what? Maybe it is time to move on. Maybe we're just not right for each other. Or maybe we are. But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know? Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole. What's happenin'. Rob here. I'll call you. That way. Which way are you going? Would you like me to turn the lights out? Or would you like them on? Yeah. I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it. Oh, right. Alright. I'd better go. I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'. Whiskey. I'm sure it isn't. Yes. You? Nor have you! Exactly! Fucking ex-actly! Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it? Books, records, films -- these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life. What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers? Nobody's heard the Crumblers. Except me. Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... I understand completely. You share a place with T-Bone? Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff? It's a great song. She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually. Hi, Marie. No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well. So you live in Chicago now? Good. Mom! For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married! She is not that kind of girl! To use a phrase. That's not what happens now. It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at. Then what are you getting so upset about? Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out. I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work. Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it? I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you. Hello? Anybody there? She just called. She doesn't even know. It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice. That's weird, isn't it? You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno... How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out. She left. She's gone. So so. Up and down. Great. Super-fantastic. Hi, Mom. Yeah? Oh, come on! Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care. Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you? I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else. Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer. Thirteen hundred. That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that. Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this. Look. Can I pay you properly? You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest. Give it to charity. Or something. It must have taken him a long time to get them together. And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh? But you must have -- These are worth at least, I don't know -- It's the best collection I've ever seen. Nice. Whatever. We're not there yet, Justin. It's rough. But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio. I'll take care of the rest. I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys. Fuck off. Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it. Jesus. That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months! Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free. I can't frisk you but the cops can. I think you have more. Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now? Eno import. Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats. Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here? Are you guys stealing for other people now?That turn you on there, RuPaul? I can't screw. I can't screw. He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid. No. Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth. He superimposed your head onto "Scarface." I think you're looking at him. Look. You were really high. Things happen. The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look. Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind. I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores. You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you. "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make? Go get a soda out of the fridge. You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers. Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil. I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking. Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet. You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it. It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy. Put it in your mouth. That pain is hunger. You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes. Makin' friends already. It's not me, moron. It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone. My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.Sure, pop. Whatever you want. Please, pop, just go back to your room. Everything's fine, pop. Now you're talking. Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that. In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino. I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline. Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here. I got no ears! I can't hear! No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go. Yes, Jimmy. Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle. Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you. You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth. You came through, Nicky. I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything! What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear... Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry. That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them. Son, just do your best. Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here. I'm too weak. The process has already begun. To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way. I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing. This is bad, Nicky. And I also happen to be a Jets fan. I was just playing with you. Who is this, Metal-lick-a? I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next? Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time. The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time. Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me. This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so... Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later. Now everybody sit down. Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?Now will you get in the flask? No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got. Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask. Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay? Let her go. Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him. Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies. Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick. Please, get out of my mind! ADRIAN! Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane. Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy? What is it? A speech impediment? But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me. I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody. Valerie's crying! How did you see me? Well tell her I said "hi" back. Where did you meet my father? How come you're not older? Wow. What... what did she look like? An angel? My mom wasn't a goat? My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis. The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks... This is baloney! I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him. I didn't murder anybody I seem to be in trouble, Beefy. We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass. Release the evil? But those are my roommate's sodas... Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked. What can I do about it? All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early. Well, let's rock and roll. Okay, just point me in the right direction next time. This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people! Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects. I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking! Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'! So far, so good. Now what? I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling... It's freezing up here, Beefy. Oh. Sorry. Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there. I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy. I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home... What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell? I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad. Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me? Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do? Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one. No. This can't be happening. Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers? So go get 'em, Dad! How bad? You're a good devil, Dad. Metallica, Dad. Come on. Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester. Definitely. I mean... tough break. Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool. Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece. Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture. Beast. You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this? That's a pretty brassiere. Coulda been much worse. I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal. I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house! You're not saying it's up to me? So go get 'em, Jimmy! We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas? Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'! Hey... See ya, fellas. No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves. Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts. Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one. Which way did he go? I'll just go to Heaven. Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you. Good idea... kill me. I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here! All right... Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie? Adrian? Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking. No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts. You smell like coconuts. I love you. Do me. From my dad's side of the family. That was Cassius! I have to, Valerie. I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal. East Rutherford. Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine. You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies. ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you. Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad... Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell? That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig. I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice. I think I'm floating. No. Valerie? I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison. Hey. I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that... Your juicy, heart-shaped ass. Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie? Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles. So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store? Good. I was concerned. Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal? What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin? School? I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts. I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though. It's freezing my hands. Uh, it's a deep south expression. Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back! Could I come with you to getting a Gelati? Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'. If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do. My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart. I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them. Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why. The South. You think I'm a tourist? That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that. That just hurt a lot. A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie. If it's Cassius, yes. It looks like the work of a brother... I don't know. Yeah. The deep South. No. Off limits. Yes. What is rent? Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten. I don't know? No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask. Yes. I would like my flask back. Hey...Stretch it out. That's a nice piece of heat right there. Yup. Daddy, Uncle Elroy, I need your help. I don't know, I think I passed out or something. I don't remember. I don't know! Why you say that? That's okay, Unc. I can't swim, either. Y'all never use it? It's cool, but where's the water? You paid cash? Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car? Yeah. Thanks, Unc. Alright, I'll remember that. Naw, it ain't like that. Where you going? I don't know... I think he went out the back. Yes you did. I'm his cousin. Cheeco. Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us. Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight. It's about to work, just come on. It's something in that hydraulic pump. Black magic. Naw, I already ate. What's the green stuff poking out? Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend. Not me. I'm gone. What you mean talk to her? What happen? No I'm not. Shut up. I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin. They're right there in the back. Nobody! Man, Day-Day is my people! I ain't trying to rob you... I don't know. Probably next Friday. Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous. make sure you get that car fixed. You're welcome, Unc. No, man, just wait. That pump was full of money. I saw where they put it. Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it. Wait. Me too. Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over. You go first. You go first. It is easy. You know why? 'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look. What's the B-G's? I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look. Naw. I bet'cha it's something better than air. You see that? Sorry about today, man. I don't know yet. Nothing. This vacuum don't work. Where's the restroom? Still gonna smell it. That ain't gonna work. You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out. I didn't think you smoked bud that much. I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters. You better stop running from that girl. I ain't trying to get in it. What's the matter? Okay, plan B. Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery? I don't know. Did ya'll forget to pay it or something? Yeah, that's why I walked down here. Yeah, ya'll got a notice today. It came certified mail. I walked. What you mean, so? Why? Yo know what? I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga. Who is that? You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D? Damn, you got a stalker. Restraining order? Where the hell you meet this girl? What? What's the matter with your girlfriend? Just a little. You straight? I know, be still. Lay down, Day-Day. Stop moving. Thanks for reminding me. Oh, yeah, where you work at? Man, this a cool house. This my baby. I feel like a new nigga in this car. I get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus. Must be nice. I wish we won the lottery. Come up on a million dollars like ya'll. This you? They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac? Who is that? I know, we had a good time. But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch. I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye's backseat. What's crackin'? Yeah, I'm cool. See you later. Okay. I got my cousin Day-Day waiting for me. Make sure. I did. Is that door locked? I'm sorry to hear that. Why didn't she put'em out? Most of it. I just hate to see you in this situation. Yes I did. Excuse me. I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life. Huh? Most definitely. It's cool. You ain't got to apologize for your brothers. They're big boys. Hell yeah, I remember you. What you mean, you don't know? Just wait here. You want us to give you a ride? Oh yeah, why you walking? Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together. Where you going? What is it? Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers. You want tickets? I don't play for no team. Can I help you? I said hold on! Hold on. Nothing. You too. Yeah, pops! Come on. You see that? Have you seen Day-Day? I'll remember. Hey, Pops, I'm grown. Can't nobody get me in trouble no more. You coming in? Why they got to have the loudest house on the block! It's alright. All damn. Smells like you didn't fall in no mud. I do. Ya'll making me look like a punk. What's the matter? Here I come! I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes! It's a long story. Right now we gotta do somethin'. Nice to meet you? What kind of activity? Yeah, I'm 'bout it. Excuse me?And I can go free? That's it? Anything you need. I will. When can I come visit? You sure you don't wanna stay? What about me? Wait here? So Cheeco can bite my ass off? Tell me where it is I'll do it. What you see? Wait for what? I hope to God that dog is happy. I ain't scared of you. We ain't little no more. No. Naw, you go first. You make it sound so easy. The bubble guts. I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself. Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's. How you know? It could be anything. Yeah, air. I didn't see nothing. Alright, Roach, see you around. What we gonna do? Craig, what the hell are you doing? Out the door and to the left. It works. Blow. Ain't no windows in here. I don't. Big bitches need love, too, Craig. Thanks a lot, Craig. Fuuuuuuck -- U! You already in. D'Wana brought Baby'D up here. $247. It says we owe $3,900...by tomorrow. How can they do this? You know what this is? You walked? If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just remember that. So. Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I'm just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that shit. I know what 'cha thinking. I thought the same thing. But it can't happen. That's the sister. You don't know Baby D. That ain't the worst part. Her little sister, Baby D. She's the one that gets real physical. But I got a restraining order on her, too. I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way. Worst day of my life. Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing. Man, it's a long story. I met D'Wana three months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I'm the daddy! I can't taste nothing. Yeah, I'm alright. Is my face still orange to you? She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper- sprayed me! I can't see! I can't see! Daddy! Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center. I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you. 'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig. Go on and make yourself at home. I'mma go get dressed for work. Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it. Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million. We bought this house and I spent the rest on this. It's the bomb, huh? Yeah, that's me. Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up. Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he's sneaky. Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac. Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall. I know; this a long way from Watts. But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen. Yep. I forgot about him cussin' out everybody. Damn that was fun. You know it's been over a year since we kicked it last? Up at the family reunion. You. Hi, Uncle Willie. Well, you gonna have to go postal then. I can't give you your damn money back on this. Okay, sir...but where's the cover? Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment. I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD? Call me. Thanks for the help. Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach? Get 'em, Craig! Money? Man, we came over here from some sugar and rolling papers. We was going to get high, and I was going to show this white boy how to make Kool-Aid. That's all. What?! What that mean? Ya'll live around here? ...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing. How y'all doing? Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding. All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar. 'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock. You wanna knock? Don't worry about it. We gotta figure out a way to get Craig out of there. He's probably getting tied up now. He's inside the house? Roach...Roach, come on. Butterflies, my ass. I'm about to go home. Are you out your mind? I'm not messing with them S.A.'s boy. You must be crazy. Let it go! Let it go, Roach, trust me. Yoooo, that's it. You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach. I don't know. I hope Craig got a good idea. We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here. I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow. Roach, what are you doing? Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint. I didn't even pass it. Today ain't my day. Are they still out there? What was that? You damn right that's the big one. Don't worry about it, man. Get the phone. Ever since my momma died the bills are always late. Craig, this Roach. Roach, this is my cousin, Craig. Yeah, it was. How you get up here? Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited. But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired. You feel me? Where's Craig? I know. I'm sorry. I got fired too. 20 minutes? Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community. By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations. Why would he take it? He don't even know you. Shhhh! Roach, shut the fuck up. Alright, no problem. We gone. Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar? Nothing.Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course. Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery. Come on, jerky, you can tell me. Got a white wife, huh? Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for? You're not related to the Jacksons, are you? Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for? Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here. Delivery! Delivery!Smokin' what? Nigga, you got knock the fuck out. Two bullets? Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick. I saw it. Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy. Craig, what the hell wrong with you? Where you been? Craig, remember what I told you. No, I'mma go on to work. I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth. Now listen to me, Craig. It's gonna be different living over here. Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit. Understand? 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can't figure that one out. Nice neighborhood, huh? Just hold your breath. I gotta get'em fixed. They don't roll down. What it smell like? Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't smell nothing. It ain't about being a punk, son. It's about this... That nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something! That's why moving wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is the best thing for you right now. I fell in some mud. Now hurry up! Well bring yo' ass on... Hurry up; today is Fri-day! And we gotta hit the high-way! Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff. What's the matter? The skills are still intact. Now tie his ass up, Elroy. Need to lose some weight. I got my mase. Don't get it twisted, Elroy. I ain't lost none of my street skills. You come way out here to get into more trouble. You could've stayed at home. Somebody left me a message. Well where's Craig and Day-Day? You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message? I got your message. Where's Craig? Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.Fuck, what's his name? Dude, dogs hate me. I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along. What about the dog? Me neither. Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do that? Come on, Day, try it. For moms. That's cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite? That's fuckin' poetic, Craig. For sure. That's how I like 'em. You know what he mean, dude. Great moves, Day-Day. I'll do it. Okay, later, bro. Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha. Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money. Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight. Hey, guys, I'm outta here. He's a boy, dude. Bite his ear! Hey, mister Joker, have a heart, bro. It's Friday. I don't know. Hey. And some rolling papers. This is a knock. Go for it. Why did he go in the house? Where's Craig? Try an' hold it, man. Squeeze your ass cheeks together. I say we go over there and kick their asses. I can take the little one. I'm not letting nothing go. They killed my board. Who the fuck is that, Day-Day? I know. Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money. You could sell your Beamer. R-U-S-H Intensely. Sorry, dude. I do. Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day. Negative...they vamped. You don't wanna know. That the big one, huh? What is it? What it say? What up, bro? Did you see that? That was a W.W.F. hit right there, huh, Day-Day? I feel you. I've just been practicing that one move all week. I thought that was it.Don't move me. Thank you. I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing. Me, too. You think they're in there? No. Thought he was with you. Passed out? Can't hang, huh? Boy, I knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They don't make 'em like they used to, baby. Suga! Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman? 'Cause your lips is getting black. I know you smoke weed, right? Good. Never... But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though. Don't need water. We didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim. Cash money. They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan. That's for suckas. They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here. Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig. I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house. Well, let me in. Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. Viagra ain't working. My back keep going out... she don't never get enough. But check this out. I got to lay some ground rules. Your my family and I love you. You're welcome to anything you want in my home. But I don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you feel me knocking? Send Betty my love. Boy you looking good. I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you. You know me? I would've shot his big ass. Hey, Willie, how's it going? Still steppin' in dog shit every day? If you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like Mike Tyson. Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'? I don't know. Sorry, my ass. When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day. What?! Ah damn. Damn. Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I've been pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes. Wet your eyes, boy. Stay in there for about 20 minutes. Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime. I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn. My back. Damn, big bro. You swung that like Sammy Sosa. Shut yo' ass up. What about that ugly dog? Willie, shut up. Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes. I don't know. Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them. Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain! I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message! Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro. He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby! This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent. Ain't that right, nephew? For what? We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow! Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight. I threw my back, again. Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me, girl. What you doing to my nephew? Suga. Go ahead and get us something to smoke on. Okay, okay, that's enough. Go put on some damn clothes. Craig, I want you to meet my old lady, Suga. Suga, this is Craig.No... Friends from the diner maybe? Sorry you had to see that. You were saying? So she did witness it? Could I have that in American? How is she? C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about... GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE? BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT? Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks. Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe. No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best... You gotta go, we're pinned down! We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you. We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish! Fuck you, Roy Ostrey! I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know? Any idea where it is? Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was? That's a nice name for what you need... No, I didn't have to. You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here. I know that... She said she was in Arizona, did she? Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...? Worry about your own goddamn lunch! Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now? What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up? I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this. I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen... No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her. That's right, you have the right to remain silent. You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!! That's it! YOU'RE GONE! 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it. A woman can write a check. So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them? Junior year! Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift... I questioned Joyce about all this... You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work... You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now. They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate. You think a woman did that?! I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy! It wasn't a woman. You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's... ...you are so goddamn weird. Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here! Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there! Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again? Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet. Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway... ...plenty Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me! And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette... It's no big deal, Betty. It's fine. Mind your own meal... Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column? I'll take a refill there, Betty... Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy? So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor? Did... did you really come here because you love this guy? When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword. Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out. Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late. Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back. Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me. If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance... You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE! That's my son! My son is dead! Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now... I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine... Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea... I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think. No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful. Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together. Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language. I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen. Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it. ...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different. ...to see you. Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it. So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty? You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you? Do you know why I'm here? Do you know who I am? No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute. Oh, this is wonderful... Who are these idiots? No, that should be more than -- Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot. How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty... Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there... Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia? Even Robert E. Lee was a loser. Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book. You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory. What part of Dixie are you from, Duane? ...and put them in your mouth. Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours. So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please? Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken. Like what? You did not just say "Injuns," Del. Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh? Is that stupid, Wesley? I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it. You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del? I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck. Could you give us an example? What do you mean? It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here? We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes. If we're for real? I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy... Who's birthday? Oh, yes, with the coffee... You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much... Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon. No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed. No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here -- We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out. What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid? Well, you were right about what that bartender said. You made your point... I was wrong. I said 'got it?' Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it? ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a... She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her... It just didn't fit her profile... Who's this? Wesley... You need to remember who you're talking to... 'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how... I never said that I believed... What doesn't? No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we... That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying. First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her. So you believed the bartender. Why? This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to. What? Where? Where is she? Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American? "When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..." Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you? What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty. One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. It's a very moving experience, trust me. We should go. Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything? How'd they describe her? I dunno... something. Why is she doing this to me? Why?... That was a really shitty thing to do. You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me. Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red! Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional! AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY! AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF! That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island! There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain. They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!! What? They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do. ...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise... Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut! You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay? "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore." It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable. Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too. Very, very impressive... No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary. Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night. Betty, Betty, Betty... You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg. No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn. I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you? Joyce was screwing Del. So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day. I hope you're right... Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this. This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat. How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you... We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember? You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing... What the hell was that, another statement? Wait. Any last words, General Lee? He's telling the truth. He doesn't know. Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond. I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts. Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals. Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make. Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead. Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up. It's not here. Let's go. What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat? I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that? What 'look'? I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts. Never abandon you instincts. I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do. We don't know which Buick, do we? This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is. That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you? Are you out of your mind? You scalped him! I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley? Hold still, Del, we're just talking here... Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off. It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels. You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped. So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we? Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley? Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy. That's what I thought. You better give me another example. I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example? Wesley... Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before? Bourbon, little water, thank you. Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore. What do you mean? Very graceful. Perfect form. Thank you for your cooperation. Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich? I see. May I? But she wanted more out of life, right? Hmm... you two in high school together? ...and how long did she work here?You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are. That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble? You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is? Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for? That is a skill! It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives. They're new to us... And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up... Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres. ...well, then you ain't got much. Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it! Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got? What? All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential. She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather... No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks? Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home. What's so special about it? I ran back in to get the phone. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks? Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God. My socks? I... I don't know... Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit! The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things. All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right? Are we gonna do business here, or not? No... I don't follow... Of what? It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks. Are you kidding me? What's to like? Fine. You got five... You don't exactly look like drug dealers. All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real. Ahh... my wife's. Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup. If you ate at the Tip Top you did. ...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em. Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid. Jesus Christ! You better believe it. It is, if you like idiots... Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up. Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...Thanks... George... I have... did it sound that bad? Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that? Oh. Of course... sorry. You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now? But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her... Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is! ...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on... STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE! Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...? Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot. Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted? Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here. In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show. Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib. Yes... maybe it was. You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life... I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?... Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling... Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know... ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here... No, I mean your dedication scares me... I've never met anyone like you, Betty. Didn't I? Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place. I don't think your friend likes me. At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me. I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute? Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv... What happened when you were twelve? Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago. She's a good person to know. So where did you study again? Yes, she is. You're late, Eric. I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you... I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George? You never gave us a chance... I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del? Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one. Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything. Oh, you mean Fred. That's very kind of you. I beg your pardon? I take it I should. I'm sorry. Good. More than you know. Is there anything else? That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake. Deranged. That would be the right word. What can I do for you, gentlemen? Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot. That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back? What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who... I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened. Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW! No! Let me try this! No! No problem, there is no... What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it! If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to -- Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it... ...yeah. Hmm? Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery. It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here! I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say? Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens. Can I have an evil twin? She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla. She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience. Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party. But... I'd be honored if you'd come. I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him. No, wait... what happened next, Betty?I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there. You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait... I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police... YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some water. -- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife -- That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass -- I know plenty. Little place called "Williams," why? What about it? Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them? Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention! Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight? Well, do something, then, damnit! Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here! Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona. Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters. Tell him what you told me. I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on... We think we know where Betty is. That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect! You're lying! What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed! One question, Doctor, please! You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!! Oww, the arm, the arm! Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden. So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing. You said a woman couldn't have done it. Anyway, so what? ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe... Yeah? You better handle what's in this garbage can first. Bad idea... Did you send anyone out there? So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee? Jesus... Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe... She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman. No, Elden, I need to... I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was... No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out. Oww! My arm, careful! Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow? They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be? You should get the order you want. I thought you said the eggs weren't... You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds... Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be... I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped. You're in serious danger! Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you! You did? Was it anyone that you...? My God... did you get a look at who did it? Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened... Uh-huh. Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few... Hey, Betty. Are you okay? Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to... Hi, Betty. You're looking good... Yeah. Why, you know him? The driver was killed. I think there's a connection -- Names, a phone number, something... Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here... Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small... I should have never come back here after college. You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together... Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case. I swear to God! She's a lesbian. Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges... I'm the one who watched the show... I was...What's wrong with you? It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge. ...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it? Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money. You were right. Del wasn't lying. ...yeah, I got it. Come on, you're stretching out my vest... Man, you have got to get some therapy. I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the... ...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind... Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!! What in the... What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time! A doctor on the show... why? "It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her! I need to get my goddamn head examined. You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me! I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca... No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh? You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman... Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense. I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure... Well... I think I saw her soul. Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!... I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it. I'm not telling. Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway. Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional. Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman... I said, 'No.' N-O. No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night? No. We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her. You know, blonde, thin, whatever... I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it. What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know... I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face. What the hell's the matter with you? Worse... you're in Texas. I know that. They paid us half. They still owe us half... Half. Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch... Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us. ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long. And then we're gonna do her right here. Right? Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch. What time're they coming? Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband? Like... us? So what the fuck's a Finn? A 'Finn?' What is a Finn? Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was. ...among others. You think so? Joyce says she's timid. ...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone. I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry... ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it. So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks? Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck. Should I kill him now? Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him. We can live with that. I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together. ...that's a good motto. I wanted to make a statement. You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this? Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story? That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out... I didn't. You gave me a look! I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth. Well, why'd you shoot him? He told us it's in the Buick. You told me how to do it! IT SURE IS!! A mark, huh? Hell of a way to die. Now, that's really stupid. That is so right. That's right. No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better. Relax, we brought the cash. Hey... you got a fine one right here! Beer, please. "Injuns?" He's waiting... Really? Seems like a nice place. Isn't that the point? What'd you get her? Hey, can you sneak me on the lot? Oh fuck... Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person? Yeah? The sport utility? ...what kinda car's Jasmine drive? What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural... ...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody? Would you say she was ambitious? You lie, motherfucker... Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine? Did Chloe crack? SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you! Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell. Huh? Yeah? Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance? I see. Did Chloe testify? Her show? I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore? Aren't they precious? Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area? Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy. Huh?! Well that was our mistake then. And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth's. I don't know if it's the one branch or all of 'em. We didn't abandon you, Pete, we just thought you was a toad. ...Pete? Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land. Why don't we bed down out here tonight? That's right! We ain't really Negroes! You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher? Gopher, Everett? 'N I'm Delmar O'Donnell. That ain't it! A miracle! It was a miracle! We'll go fetch it with ya, Everett. Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey? Oh, okay. What sat mean exactly, Everett? Everett, my beard itches. 'N turned into a frog - Oh my God! Huh. I guess they'll tack on fifty years for me too. So - where's all the money from your armored-car job? Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias. Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that. Okay, Everett. Not that I'm aware. Uh, we uh- I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him. Course it's Pete! Look at 'im! Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad! Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this! Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George? Yeah, look at me. Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto! Damn! We gotta skedaddle! Izzat right? Five... hunnert... thousand... each. This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett. Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift. You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none. But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed! Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too! Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine! Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo! Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward! Gopher, Everett? Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett. What do we do now, Everett? How'd he know about the treasure?I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene. Our pleasure, Big Dan. Once again we find ourselves in agreement. What kind of work do you do, Big Dan? It ain't the law! You can't do this - we just been pardoned! By the Governer himself! Hang on there - You can't do this - Waitaminute - Waitaminute - Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley. Honey, it's just - Shutup, Delmar - it's just - I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs. Well, you'n me'n Pete'n Tommy are gonna be the power behind the throne so to speak. Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act... He was never turned into a frog! It's Tommy! They got Tommy! Boys, we was chained together. I hadda tell ya somethin'. Bustin' out alone was not a option! I never knocked over any armored- car. I was sent up for practicing law without a license. Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the... Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man! Hit by a train! Truth means nothin' to Woman, Delmar. Triumph a the subjective! You ever been with a woman? Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent! Pete have a brother? We're adventurers, sir, currently pursuin' a certain opportunity but open to others as well. Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him. The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon. These things- You can't display a toad in a fine restaurant like this! Why, the good folks here'd go right off their feed! ...I'm not sure that's Pete. What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar! Whuhh... Well ya know, Delmar, they say that with a thrill-seekin' personality, what goes up must come down. Top of the world one minute, haunted by megrims the next. Yep, it's like our friend George is a alley cat and his own damn humors're swingin' him by the tail. But don't worry, Delmar; he'll be back on top again. I don't think we've heard the last of George Nelson. Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to... Where's Tommy? I left my pomade in that car! Maybe I can creep up! What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete? Four hundred, Delmar. What'd the devil give you for your soul, Tommy? Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear- That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed. I thought you said you were innocent a those charges. Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry- And no transmission belt for two weeks neither. ...but try getting a decent hair jelly. NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT! Fire! I hate fire! Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision- Well sure, honey, but... Yes, but honey - A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey. Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake. Well, I'm sorry honey - You - You said - You said it was in the rolltop desk! Not your... - in the gods - Huh? And you were right about that ring. Any other weddin' band would not do. But this-here was foreordained, honey; fate was a-smilin' on me, and ya have to have confidence - ...Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose. But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end... All's well that ends well, as the poet says. It's just a symbol, honey - Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing - Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap. Where's your ring, honey? Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings. ...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus! I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him! Now Penny, stop that! Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state... It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened - No, this is gonna work! I just gotta get close enough to talk to her. Takin' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip. I'm goddamn bona fide. I've got the answers! Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance- Pete... I do apologize. I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra! Damnit, I just hadda bust out! My wife wrote me she was gettin' married! I gotta stop it! Fact of the matter - there never was! Well, but Pete... Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing... Aw, that's all right. I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us. Quitcha babblin' Pete - time to skedaddle. ...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh... Itta Bena, now, uh, that would be... Pete, the personal rancor reflected in that remark I don't intend to dignify with comment, but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism. Consider the lilies a the goddamn field, or-hell!- take a look at Delmar here as your paradigm a hope. Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really. What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough? Million point two. Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway. And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point. For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar. Pete, don't be ignorant- Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing? So I borrowed it till I did know! Who was fixing to betray us! It was in his bureau. Sell that. I figured it could only have painful associations for Wash. Don't I know it. Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS! Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty! Well I'm votin' for yours truly too! Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote! Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity-two weeks from everywhere! Forget it! Just the dozen hairnets! No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan! Hold on there - I don't want this pomade, I want Dapper Dan. Two weeks! That don't do me no good! Okay sir, but Mert and Aloysius'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write. Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil! Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material. Heck, you're silly with it, aintcha boys? Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar. Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can. Who's the honcho around here?Good Lord, what do we do? Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood. Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys. Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure. No, they never did turn me into a toad. Do not seek the treasure! What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place? Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn. All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust! That's right! You mis'able little sneak thief... We ain't gonna make it walkin'. How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n? That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows! We prayed to God and he pitied us! This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band. Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied - Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum! ...With my added time for the escape, I don't get out now 'til 1987... I'll be eighty-four years old. ...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence... But... But... but... I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say! It's awful white of ya to take it like that, Everett. I feel wretched, spoilin' yer play for a million dollars'n point two. It's been eatin' at my guts. They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty. It was a moment a weakness! ...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of... Isn't it, uh... The hell it ain't square one! Ain't no one gonna pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers, and one of 'em a know-it-all that can't keep his trap shut! Well that hardly sounds like you... An' all my meals for free... A million dollars. Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade. The preacher said it absolved us. Well, I'll be a sonofabitch. Delmar's been saved! That don't make no sense! You didn't know that at the time! To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop. From his loving Cora. Ay-More Fie- dellis. How's this a plan? How're we gonna get a car? We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake! Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st. Today's the 17th! YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS- The hell you say! Wash is kin! Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly! Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?Their names, ranks and posts? What officers? I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war. Sir? Very well, let us move on to... I beg to differ. One is a command decision on your part. The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances. That is a separate issue. Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other. There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men. Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention. Apology accepted. Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable. Thank you. First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me. You are familiar with how these things are done. In fact, I would like to claim aggrieved status. Oh. Very well, then. Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin? Oh? Let us. Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you... As you wish. Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name. Please forgive me for keeping you waiting. My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed. Thank you for that, Colonel. Do you see that, Colonel? Civility is a secondary virtue. It is superseded by duty. How can we end this madness? And if I triumph, you triumph. If I fail, you fail. Most certainly. Arrange it. It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley. Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels. My harrier. Join us, Colonel.That would be nice, too. That would be nice. It's a start. If I'd known you were going to look like this, I never would have put ink in your tea. Uh... uh... I... I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan... Oh, right. Baking powder, we need baking powder. I know him well enough? He's my father. He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed. As you did at Fort Wilderness? I see, do as I say, not as I do. Go on. I'm not my mother. I can't have the respect without the knowing. That's not enough. Tell me. That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation. Tell me what everyone doesn't know. No, I don't. Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness? Is it her? Is Anne in there? Seven homes along the Black River so far... Tarleton has a list of our men, most are on it. A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list, burning them, killing whomever resists, women and children, as well. I know. Cheraw Falls. Sir, I'd like to request a furlough. Two days? Come with me. I'll tell you when we get there. Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about. She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her. Full sentences. As if she had been speaking all along. She got me at a more impressionable age. She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan. Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause. When was that? In the swamp at the expense of your men? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family? Fourteen dead, eleven wounded, eighteen captured. We're low on salt. I should go to Pembroke and get some. Father? And the dogs, too, I'll wager. I didn't see any. Less than a mile. Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear. You know how old I am. If you're here only for revenge, you're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself. Yes... ... father. Yes, sir. He tried. It didn't take. Yes, sir. My father taught me. I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston. Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good. We'd cover more ground if we split up. What now, sir? Father... I have no choice, I... I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro. Have you seen any Redcoats? Yes. When I have children, I hope I don't hide behind them. Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle. He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body. Yes. He seeks a levy of troops and money. The British army is barricaded in Boston. Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army. Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July. Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent. He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats. The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved... Father, a post rider came from Charleston. You have a letter inside. You don't hate him. There are some letters here from him. Some are just to you. I know he did and he's sorry. He'll come back as soon as he can. He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.Congratulations. When? No. No. It's alright. I'm very happy for you. The hell I do. What do you mean, old and ugly? No, he takes after his mother... Pride will do. His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically. But he has a weakness. I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes. You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name. His journals, letters, maps, books... It worked. How many men can you raise? I expect to try. Two pounds, fourteen ounces. Goodbye, Charlotte. Of course, I do. I know that. Excuse me? I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel. I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed. I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her... How did this... how did I let this happen? Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought. You look well, Charlotte. They're from good stock on their mother's side. They refused to give me their names. Their ranks are nine lieutenants, five captains, three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow. Their posts? We picked them up here-and-there last night. If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men. You have eighteen of my men. I want them back. Prisoner exchange. As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement. And my men are excellent marksmen. I consider them linked. Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children? And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention? That one is a bit more difficult. Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner. I will do so as soon as possible. Very well, proceed, sir. Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status. I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War. I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled. Shall we proceed? Colonel will do. Apology accepted. My pleasure, sir. If this war is about more than Thomas, it's about more than Anne, as well. Stay the course. Yes. It was a different time, son. And you're a better man than that. We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort. It was two weeks before they were all dead, all except two. We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon. The eyes, fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee. The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight. That seemed to make a difference. The war went another year, things went better... and men bought us drinks. We buried them, then we went to track. It was a cold trail and they were moving fast. We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford. That's why it was four years between you and Thomas. It took me that long to regain her respect. Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born. I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her. That's right. And what do they know? Everyone knows. It's what made me a hero. Me, Harry Lee, all of us. I got a medal. Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes. Everyone knows what happened. You know what happened. She is. Don't go in there. Don't go in there. Where? It's beautiful there. Your mother and I were there once, before you were born. Granted. Where are you going? What? She said that? Oh, my Lord, she said that? I don't believe it... and I wasn't there for it... She spoke? Susan spoke? You learned her lessons better than I. Stay the course... your mother used to say that to me when I'd get drunk or lose my temper. No... I should have killed him when I had the chance? Gabriel? Are you asleep? Pride is his weakness. Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it. These four wagons must be his. Flanking riders? God help us all when you're forty. How old are you? Is it? And, Corporal... ... be careful. Alright, Corporal, you take Bennington, Harrisville, Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp. I'll take the north side of the river. We'll meet at Snow's Island. Did your father teach you humility? Is that so? Oh? It's safer if we stay together. We put out the word. We'll start along the south side of the Santee... It's already over. You're in no condition to ride. Not yet. What happened? Do you intend to enlist without my permission? When you have children, I hope you'll understand. Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote for independence. And the Governor? Is that why the Assembly was convened? What news? Anything about the convention in Philadelphia? The middle colonies? Thank you. How's the spotted one's milk? Your son, what did you name him? I hope so. And congratulations on the birth of your son. Goodbye, Harry. It is ended. Two. Gabriel and Thomas. Don't touch him. His wife was killed yesterday. She was with child. How many men does Cornwallis have under his command? They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard. They'd be better off letting it move on. You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia? So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then. Long time. When? So now Cornwallis will head north, link up with Clinton and finish off Washington. What are my orders? Who's in command? Where is he now? We saw. I'm sorry I wasn't here for this. Green Dragoons came to my home, killed my son, Thomas. It was Tarleton himself. Thank you. No, thank the Lord. He's more like his mother. Gabriel. I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles. That's what I'm doing. I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead. ... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery... Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery... There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal... We don't have to go to war to gain independence... You were an Englishman then... Thirteen years... Harry, Harry, Harry... It's Mister Marion. That will be all, Major. I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis. I'm familiar with appropriate behavior at a military parley. Thank you. Leave him. Take care of William and Susan. Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed. Hide there. If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm. Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel. No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads. We're safer here. Don't worry. Four, five miles. He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he? How many came back? It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars. Don't depend on my decency. I'm one of that sort. For what? Reverend. No, he won't. There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory. If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it. Worse. Remember Braddock? I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen. Gray. Put them away. Put those away. God willing. Seventeen. Not yet, Thomas. Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do. Quiet. Six-pounders. Lots of them. Thank you. Did you finish the upper field?If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself -- Don't come back, not tonight, not again -- Go back to your room. Quickly. They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn. Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice. By whom? The Marquis? "Turn you out?" Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here. Is that a promise you can truly keep? The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court -- In part, yes. Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan? But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence? But why must you indulge in his pornography? Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read. Not now, or we're both done for. Has he hurt you? The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead. Madeleine -- We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption. You'd deny a dying man his salvation? I must grant him his last rites. Free his mouth. You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more. Of course. I'm here. Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue. We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin. Then it must've been love -- Was it impotence? Why was it you never took her by force? You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged. AND DID YOU? I know, because I felt it myself -- -- the passion in your heart -- I saw the longing in your eye -- It's no secret that you loved her. An innocent child is dead. Your words drove Bouchon to -- Your wig. Remove your wig. NOW STRIP. I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS! OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES! You expect me to pimp Madeleine? What on earth would that require? What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked! If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive. Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification -- Because your writing continues, unchecked. -- and your meat shall be de-boned. Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal -- Valcour. His chair. His rug. Good day, Marquis. That's enough. I don't know who you insult more; her or me. You always do. Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them. You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur. Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written. Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur. Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior -- If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice. How can one man possibly be so selfish? You mean to take us all down with you? If you only mean to dupe me again -- Do I have your word? You among them? Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves -- Our future lies in the stroke of your pen. More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure. One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties! But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast? But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well? And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature! It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" -- Enough to discern its tenor. But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction! What did you do? Bribe one of the guards? Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life. I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption. In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters. We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich -- It's not even noon -- I've stared into the face of evil... ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down. No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again. I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last. Poorly. And my own. I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it. As you say, Doctor. If only blood will appease you, then shed mine. Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine. It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children -- You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force. I'll do everything in my power -- That's not our intent -- It was not inspired by circumstance. It was fiction, of course. Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife -- I have. He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend -- He's sworn to obedience. I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here. Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now -- On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself -- A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent. Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward? But he's one among some two hundred wards -- Shut down? Yes? I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them. You have to believe me, I had no idea -- For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable. It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind. Oh. That. He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards -- Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises -- A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture. Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one. His wife's influence. He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value. I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation. A few indiscretions in his youth. If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs? You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain. Of course. Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion. Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution. Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory. They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide. -- and the listless ones do the binding. I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note -- Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas. Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves -- Will you sleep soundly tonight? And you? It must've been an ordeal. How is the patient faring? My, my. You have exceeded my expectations. HER NAME, ABBE. Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name... He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes? You'd suffer in her stead? This child let loose the beast from its cage -- He'll do no such thing. What could cause a tincture like this? Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum. -- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse -- You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain -- No. It most certainly was not. Of course. Oh indeed? -- then I've friends of my own to visit. You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here -- And --? Well? And place my reputation at stake? You find this amusing, do you? You're a sentimental man. Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake? In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here. Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor. Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions. All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it? Do you favor its publication? Well...? And his writing? What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche? And he's never once attempted escape? His wife's? Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison? Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure. Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax -- I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction. It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy. I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things. It's a formality; truly. This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood? I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben�; I look to the future. Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben�? Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not? I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben�. Mine is a higher mission. But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment. It's libelous; you wouldn't dare. You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed -- I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use. This is neither the time nor the place -- Good God, Marquise -- Of course. And I in yours. Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride. -- words alone are insufficient. If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity -- That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation. What a beautiful thought, Marquise. But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books? Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them... That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves. You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton... I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf. With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix? I pray you: be succinct. My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics. It is customary to write first, and request an appointment -- You prefer a book to your husband's company? I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire. Doesn't that please you? Do as I say. Leave at once --"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --" "With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --" "One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..." Now give the signal. Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones. For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes? Surely you'll grant me a final word. Abbe de Coulmier! I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed? I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE -- NEVER! Who's to say I did not? Go to hell! IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK. I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL! Don't confuse one organ with another -- -- that was lust -- Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog -- So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not? For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not! Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I? It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man. Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape! Coulmier, you animal! I wasn't talking about Madeleine. A night spent with the partner of my choice. I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily. A man after my own heart... Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe. I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT! WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE? -- water! -- Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron! That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime -- And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass -- My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death? THEN BUGGER ME! You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw. "Part the gates of heaven," as it were -- Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit -- I have a proposition. I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create -- That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me. You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper -- What the devil -- We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw. He can't do that to me. Don't be absurd; it's only a play. Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine? You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill. Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended. Mightier than the sword indeed. They can't be serious. It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he? I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine. It's a fiction, not a moral treatise. I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die. There I was taxed; it's true. And --? Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages? But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness -- Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small -- I'll fill page after page, I promise. Don't be so sure. I'm entertaining you now, aren't I? It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink. I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you? Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated. Care for a splash of wine, Abbe? "What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?" Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air... Yes! You shall. Of course you shall -- -- who'll whisper it to Bouchon -- Go on, child. How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air? First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it. Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream -- You're far crueler than I, my sweet. Surely you've seen a man naked. They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one. My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe... Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door... The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium. The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap. The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am... A kiss for each page. Fiendishly so. Most assuredly. The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane. I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings.... You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator... If only these coins purchased your other talents, too. The peril of composing such incendiary prose... It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake. Did I frighten you? Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole... I'm hungry for a proper visit. It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU? Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor -- It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it? They've put you up to this, haven't they? You've come to lecture me? How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE? For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink? Hm? Tell me. What other treats?That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar. Y'know something, baby? If you were my sister? I'd still want to wake up Christmas morning with you... He'll be dead when he does. Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain. I've been doing good, though. I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you. That's a book, baby. That's a book of love. -- till he fucked his parole -- Searching for a money man... All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters... ...whoever she is. He wants the money. We're talking, aren't we? He'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway. Bury him all over the place. And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help! I promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! When he helped us! Loverboy don't want to play! IS THIS NICK MASON!!?? Is this the fucker you been writing all year!? Is this him!? A man of some travels. Read you're a man of some knowledge. Read a lot about you, Nick. You better be here to be good to her, loverboy. 'Cause she's been good to you. Must have a way with stationery. So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams. Ash? Ash? Get in the CAR! Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End. You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself -- Can't be attracting attention, right? 'Tis the season, convict. Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys. That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters. No gun. No, you're not. No way. I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing. No. NO. We got five. Putting Ashley outside. What's the code? Sing it in pictures, Nick. Start singing. Nick. I been trying to hit you. It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery? I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else... MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!? What'd you tell that casino manager? Got something to say to me, Nick? Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. So we're gonna have a contest. A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain. Don't tip. You got one hour. Get out. You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral. Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place. You do. You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. Put it on. Don't have Weather Channel in the Mountain, Nick. Rather be back in the Mountain? Bring back some memories, Nick? We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not. Why not. Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you. So what the hell good are you... They wouldn't have changed the security setup. We walked the place for a week. What the fuck are you talking about. I did. What? And which of these doors here lead up to the security level? We got faith in you, Nick Mason. You're our inside man. You know where the guards are. You know how to get in and out. You know where the money is. We're taking down that casino, convict. You're the guy gonna tell us how. You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now? The hell you don't. How much money's in that casino? Day-to-day. You knew the place -- Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- Wrong, Nick. It's drowning. What's her greatest fear? Be more specific. Where'd she drop her cherry? What'd they call her in college? What'd they call her in high school? What's her middle name? Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? Where's she work? Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. Get him back in the rig. A girl says she loves you, you say something. She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart. Hey. She says she loves you, Nick. You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus. And you think telling me that's gonna help your cause. So you could get down her chimney. So you could get with my sister. But you were saying you were... You're not Nick Mason... You what... Put him in the truck. Who are you now. The hell I can't. Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well. Where the HELL did he go? Get in there and watch 'em. Watch their every fuckin' move. Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it. Leave the tree. Take 'em. GO!!! OPEN IT!!! Where is he?! Where is he?! The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians! THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE! He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe. Show's over.Fuckin, Zookerman -- Oh, man -- It's a roach, guy -- I gave them me. Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough. Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by -- Do what? Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man. Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me. Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley? Millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. I was in the Mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? Let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. Getting one who could show 'em a sure thing. ...for Christmas... ...be with her... Tell Ashley... I... Tell her... I'll be there ... Ash... Ashley... Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus... Jesus, Rudy -- Alamo... Don't move, Rudy! Rudy, don't move -- Just a roach, Zook. Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume. No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going. So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. Aw, Rudy. Don't look like he missed the sunlight. Thought you hate your old man. Thought you hated Sidnaw. Shoulda written, Rudy... Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room. No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges. Me and her got a connection. Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking. Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick. Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy. Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know. Why you gotta say a thing like that. Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want... Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms. She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting. And a slice of pecan pie, right? What? Fuckin' Christmas, man. Fuckin, Christmas on the outs. Three days, man. We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do. Hell you haven't. What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?I never told you my name. But I never said Rudy. No -- You said Merry Christmas, Rudy. Rudy. How'd you know my name? I'm glad it was me. He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. I saved your life. We still gonna spend Christmas together? Yeah. That's love. Well. I'm going home. I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home. Keep 'em there for a little while. Here's the Picasso. Is he in his room? We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun... Is there any way you could get into his truck? You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him? If he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. I'm working on it here. I'm almost done. We need to find a way to make me part of it. I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map. We'll need one. You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns. They'll have guns. Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name. Don't say my name... You saved me. ...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years... All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns... Get to the bridge! HEY! HEY! DOWN HERE! We get to the bridge, we're all right! There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing -- -- drink this for me. Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now. Get your own room. Get your own room, Ashley. We? What "we"... Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me... They've never done a robbery? Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed? And I'm his ticket. What's the last place they took down? He working for them on this one? Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway? So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they? Well, shit, Judas, you shoulda at least gotten that -- For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings? But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya. Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where? They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it-- Canada. ...maybe I die for Nick... Nick died for me.... Your pen palls dead, lady. You're in on this. You told him about Nick's letters. He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he. You're not hearing me here -- Get the hell off of me! JESUS CHRIST! I'M NOT NICK! You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?! You sold him out. You motherfucker. What's going ON!!! What the fuck is going on. ...the truck driver... Your brother... I'm not him. I... You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy. NO! I'll see what I can do. Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work. We'll have more fun in Detroit. Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet -- Well, I don't know about that -- Beauty and fragrances. Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything -- Ash, you've gotten me enough -- Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate? Ashley, Jesus -- Where the hell are you going? Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too... Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him -- Well, wasn't all me, y'know. Had some bad relationships, didn't you. Tell me again. Yeah. Me too. Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? No, not that, no... I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time. One more. Smile. One more. Smile. Do that again. I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to -- Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here. No, hey, I like your coat -- No, no -- I don't think it's negative five. Negative five? Gotta be ten degrees out there. How'd you know my name. How'd you know my name was Rudy. How'd you know my name... Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers. Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE! What, we walking in there and delivering toys? You gotta be kidding me. What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys? Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it. There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat. I'm no threat without a gun. Six men means six guns. You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it. You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six. Six is me. You need six. So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. You need six. Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out. Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me... No, Gabriel... no... He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me! NO! Nothing... I promise-nothing... Nnn... nothing... ...ttt..tt... two out of three? ...never... tried... Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred. Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars? I'm gonna need some money. Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to -- Do I get a country-western name? At least gimme video poker. What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots? A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? Might as well be. More than you know. 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. Trust me. They won't recognize me. They won't recognize me. You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map. When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe. And I worked there. For a year. This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- This isn't the Tomahawk. I said, who the hell made the map? Hell. Ten? Hey, it's... been two years -- Christmas... Eve... Five million? I don't know. Hey. Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. No. It's her brother. Her brother. A station wagon in Canada. What college. Bam Bam. Samantha. J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. What? I had better sex in prison. Wish I had a brother like you. She says a lot of things. I never worked at no casino. Yes! Yes! Yes! I shared his cell! I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick! I -- I just wanted to be -- I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place! You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not! No, you can't -- You... you don't know me -- We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations! Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. What? His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed. I promise you, I didn't know! Merlin, I didn't know -- DROP THE GUNS! NOW! Here's my present to you, truck drivers -- You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms. You gotta get someone upstairs. What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked. He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me. Not with you. Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?! I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate. ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... You gave them me. Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember Walk outta there and tell her I was you. How'd you know I'd do it. And you set me up. She set them up. All of them. NICK!!! NO!!! YOU TELL HER! You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT! No, man! No, no, no! GUARD!!! Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD! GUARD!!! GUARD! GUARD! Standing right here, man! Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing -- Good for you. Protein. I don't know, I've seen the business world. What, working security? Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary. Five years, Nicky. Five years. I just want to go home. Just taste that Christmas turkey. All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months. Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog? Oh. She's using a new perfume. What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her. For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature. I'm just talking. I'm just saying. Yeah. Fuckin' Christmas. Yeah. Yeah. And some pecan pie. Get a hot mug of chocolate. First thing I'm gonna do. Hot chocolate. Not yet. Ain't there yet. Get to thinking about it, it won't happen. Haven't thought about it. THEY'LL OPEN ONE! Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money! You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money -- Switch seats with me. You're hitting for MY cards! POP! That was My card! That was my king! That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card! I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes. They changed the layout. Since when? What the hell is this room? Who the hell made this map. I'M NOT NICK!Was that it? Well, ok. You're wrong. You sent them. I had no choice. I'm looking for my friends. Where are they? Last chance. Where are they? What? Call the police? Where is it? This place? The strip joint? Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King. I was hoping you'd find out. Lauren's father's involved. He bought the cops fancy cars, I don't know what else. It's a company called D-E-L-T. I think Lauren found out. You think I'm crazy. The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. Two down. Two to go. Dream on. We won't. What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing? You killed her. I saw it. A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car. This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five. Think maybe knives do? I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people... What did they give you? What did they give you? Wrong. Answer. One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car. You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today. Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A. You lied at my trial. Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator. Sssshhh. She's resting. The scar. Good thing in a situation like this. AAAANK. That's not how we play the game. We're going to play a little game called "Who's got the Scar." I was talking about you. How can you die if you're already dead? The scar. Which of you has it? I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why. What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident? I want you to think of me as the guy who killed you. I heard you were looking for this. Erin. I'll always be with you. ... it connects you to me... Erin. Who? It's ok, it's ok... It's what Lauren would do. All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy. You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me... Have to find him first. ... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing. This tree. Here's where it happened. No. You don't. Erin. It's not your fault. No... Are you ok? This is where it happened. Right over here. Because you need to understand. And you need... to be careful. From the bonfire over there. Look at it. No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know. This. I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why. I'm not hiding. I'm right here. And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn. I told you, I knew your sister. I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you. He didn't kill her. Someone else did it. Your father gave them to both of you. That locket you're holding. You have one just like it. I was a friend of your sister's.Yeah? Smoke. Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else. So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution. -- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade? And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey. What does the letter say? Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight. Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score. -- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad. Something your father would've come up with. Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble. You can't take him out this late in the game. We can't do that, Bobby. Jesus... Give it a rest. You were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat. He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again. It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out. They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here. The other thing is... Who gives a shit about the midterms now? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us. Every day the sun comes up... says something about us. It shouldn't have. But it did. The sun came up today. -- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds. Yes it is. Then they should speak up. I think it's a bad idea. Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families. What's it about? Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early. No. I'm glad I'm home. -- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won. I'll be evacuated with the President. Nothing. Nothing you don't know about. Tomorrow's the big day. Just have the car ready to go if I call or if the Civil Defense Warning comes on. I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off. Kids are supposed to get detention. Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi. Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home. He was. Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight. Forget it, Scotty. Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about. I said his heart, not his attention. Busy. But you've got his heart. Back to work. Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard. I, uh... Hey, sport. You winning? Wrong, and you get to wax my car. Secretary of Defense... And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it. Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence... Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message. They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies! Hello? Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time. Yeah, a good political solution. Then somebody'd better deny it publicly. If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion. Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba. And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup. Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too. That's going to be tough. You know how these guys are about their chains of command... Maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. At the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. And at the end of the day, they may end up being right. I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple. Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple. What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for? All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows... I don't like what's happening. You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support. We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to. Damn right I'm scared. I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly. No way. You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on. Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day. There is no expert on this subject, no wise old man. Call me Irish, but I don't believe in cooler heads prevailing. Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State. Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight. There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them. Should be here any minute. Not as far as the election goes. Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo... No you weren't. And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house. You were in the room. It was your purview. It was your job to make sure Bissel wasn't fucking us over and you didn't do it. You've got the most important job in the world right now. You're the smartest guy the President has. Besides me. Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs -- Moving the line. Stroke of genius. Six months from now, I'm not going to care. Are you? We'll deal with it. Jesus Christ... That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker. Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...Doesn't matter to me. If I went down in history like Adams, I'd die happy. All they say about him today is -- Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on. We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys. That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em? McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out. We've got bigger problems right now. Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser. Well, I'm not. I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen. Lying bastard. Lied to my face. We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can. But I sure as hell am going to test him. Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy. We can't worry about everything right now. We've got to figure out what we're going to do before we worry about how we do it. So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast. Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation? Good. Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive, intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets? Then we have no choice. General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night. So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world? How do we work with them if there's been a hard-line coup? General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve. -- I have the authority. I am the commander-in-chief of the United States, and I say when we go to war! All right. Then I guess it's time. Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships? How long until the army is ready? Is this the Chiefs' recommendation? An invasion... Max. We give them something. We tell them we'll remove the missiles from Turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. We also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off. Okay, Ken. We're going. You're sure... I've got to move. What do you have, Kenny? Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52. Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution. It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here. I don't want to listen to this again. What's that? He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them. We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships. But it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles. Any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. Me. How does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily? I'm gonna protect those pilots. We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them. I know, I know... In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there. They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me. I don't know. I don't know. You're scared to cancel on Daly. I don't care. Cancel it. Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet? Let's get out of here. Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone. Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast. You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them. No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles. Good. Still think Cuba isn't important? So what've we got today? I was, you bastard. I was eating that. Will somebody find out what's going on?! Captain, belay that order! Bob, where's that coming from! Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection. Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first? Bob? Bob. Bet you had a late night.What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind. Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head? That's pretty simplistic, don't you think? You're welcome. Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion. He's right, you look horrible. So I hear. Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference. He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast. I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in? We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on. He's fine. He's narrating. Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip. Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me. I peeked. Me? What can I do? That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher. Do you know he won't expel him? Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his? The jacket, Tripp. We need the jacket. In a sense. Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this -- is for the best. Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories. You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage. Naturally you have copies. Christ, Tripp. How did you know? There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up. Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car... Such as. The hood jumper? So whose car is it? Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car. Want some help with that? It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas. Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that? So -- what do we do now? I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant. The Chancellor's here? Now? So what's the problem? I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid. Ye-es? The truth. I know that's always been real important to you. Okay, check this out... Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack. So modest. Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed. Jesus. There must be two dozen windows on that thing. How are we supposed to find his? Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth... So tell me about you and the Chancellor. Competence. Bad enough. And God knows I don't exactly fit the new corporate profile. I've been doing this a long time, Tripp. I feel this kid in my bones. You know -- based on what I've read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this Big Parade. Is it a little late to call the Chancellor? Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives. Good God. Let's go rescue him. Kidnapped? By who? James? My James? What's happened? Sometimes we have to improvise. Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you? What? Ohhhh. Is that... it? Tripp, where the hell... Tripp?! Where would we go? Back up. Go out the other way. Just go around him. Hit your brakes. Tripp. That was good. Because... because... And he had a younger brother who... was... a... He can't piss standing up anymore. Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled. Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple. No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor? On the contrary, it could be just the ticket. He is. Take my word for it. Well, I'm going to read it anyway. So. Is he any good? He finished it Winter Break. He has a book. Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog. Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way. Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do. I thought you were Mrs. Gaskell's hobby, Tripp. But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here? Left you...? Who? Emily? Trip?? Yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs. He owes God money. You know, he queered himself for good with Esquire. You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip?? Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But... ...I get pressure. Know what I mean? I thought you were tinkering. Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible? Mm. You're stoned. If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me. Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh. Perfect. Well then, shall we? Your wife. I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor... Brimming. Say hello to my new friend, Miss Antonia... uh... Tripp!You peeked, didn't you? Gee, I don't know, Crabs... Improvise. You're good at that. No. But I don't think that matters. Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that. Came to my senses. Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket... I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle. Kind of a sign, you're saying. He was never able to reproduce them. That was MacCaulay. I have an alternate version of the first chapter. Call it a hunch. No wonder he screwed us over. ...we find the jacket. 'That's my car, motherfucker.' He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his. My guess -- Vernon Hardapple. Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give. Don't touch it. First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car. Find the jacket. Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail. Evidently. Coming! Who do you think it is? There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem? Shut up, James. Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away. Is he awake? Crabtree. It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth. So sensitive. Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here. I told you. They keep him chained in the basement. Come on. What's to tell? Which is? How bad is it for you? Only in your bones? Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines. Maybe... I don't know. It's a little late to call Admissions. Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live. His parents. Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped. Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me? Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room. You stay there. Listen, Hannah, I'm flattered, really, but right now I -- Shit. Wait here. I'll be right back. Shit. What's this guy's problem? Yes. Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma. He heard everything we were saying. Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death. He lives with his mother. And now he's addicted to painkillers. Not Curtis. He's a boxer. A flyweight. Shut up and drink. I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now. Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's -- No. Not yet he isn't. I know. He started it Fall semester. I'm sure. Where is everyone? Is that just beer? Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today. This morning. I found a note in the kitchen. She left me. Crabs. He said something about being between things. It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money. I just mean... I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture. It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it. Isn't she? She's still a transvestite. She's a transvestite. Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities. Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown. Emily? I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling. How are you, Crabtree? Hey, Jeff. If you're really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall. It's cool, Jeff. Really. No... Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff. How are you -- is it Joe? You must be mistaken. It's mine. Excuse me? I have to see her. As soon as possible. So is my friend... is Sara still here? They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing. Actually, it was her husband's dog... She told you about... I know. Is that in my chart? I've been trying to finish a book... Spiro T. Agnew was vice president, I believe. The last month maybe. Do you think that's why I've been having these... ...spells? I've been doing that a lot lately. I passed out. Sure. Right. Well, thanks. For the lift. Boy or girl? Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question? 'Fraid so. A Manhattan book editor murdering a Mormon girl's clutch. No, really... It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore. Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K. Relax, Vernon... Who's got a gun? Vernon. Yea? No. Sara, you don't understand... ...reconcile with Emily. What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just... Yes. But that's not why I called... I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about... Sara? Hi. It's Grady. Could you hold on a minute, honey? Hello? Yes, James. Well, let's see if we can keep that from happening. I'm a little worried, James. Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out. It's Walter's dog and yes, she does know. But let's spare her the details. Come on, your shoes are in the hail. And we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine. Ah, wear whatever you want. In the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of Amontillado. Come on. Up. Get out of here. Near Carvel? I remember that. Five or six years ago. James, like it or not, they're your parents. James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand? Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat. You just worry about yourself, James. Okay? When nobody's looking. I eat. I don't know... 'Episodes.' Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells. No thanks. In a minute. Get us a table. Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore. And don't be so goddamn sensitive. Who cares what anybody thinks anyway? You want to be a good writer? You want to be a great writer? Then stop giving a damn what other people think. Most of them haven't thought in years. Who cares what I said last night, James I -- I was drunk, I was stoned. I'd been bitten by a dog. My wife had left me. How 'bout cutting me some slack? Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay? I didn't mean it that way. I never said that. The hell I am. Not you. Your talent. Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you. That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop. James, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat. I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does? Why do you wear that coat? Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever. Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking. It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's -- Who said anything about girlfriend? What? Jesus... Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least ...we abstain. I just wanted a little sip? Tell me, James, exactly what point was it that you turned into Serpent Boy? I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. Make yourself at home. I'll be right back. Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box. How can you tell? That's right. That one. Unless I miss my bet... my wife. Kinship. I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. Amazing. Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper? What kind of dancer? Your father worked in a mannequin factory? I never heard of it. Carvel? Where's Carvel? Where's that? Jesus, James. Wow. Glaucoma? Maybe... Your aunt? Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on. Yeah, well, actually... Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you? Hm. I don't know... Me. Jesus, James, you should've told someone. But James. I mean... How long? So where have you been staying? I guess there's probably a story behind that. Well done, James. Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia. No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch. Hm. Ah. I don't believe in writer's block. Washed up? But... ? I think it's sort of writing itself at this point. Afraid so. Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right. What'd you tell him? What'd he say? Who? Sure. There is, but it's not that interesting. Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it. Oh. I'm okay. I just lost my balance. You're welcome. Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium. What's he saying? Is he all right? Right. That's why you were standing in the Chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. You're fine, all right, you're fit as a fucking fiddle. Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle. Have one. Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here? She is. Ah. Here we go... Miss Sloviak's. That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding... I've got tenure. Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman. I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog. Yea, James. He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one. Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me. Couldn't you've just pulled him off me? Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog. Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now. Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight. Right. Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too. I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things. Like the lady herself. Really. Go ahead. So I'm told. That's really it. This is worth it. James. Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see. Heaven? You're right. So what are you doing out here? You cold, James? Really? That's remarkable. Well... Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control. Sounds like a good one. She went crazy, Frances Farmer. You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw? Maybe it's because she's beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it's inevitable that it will in some way. Relax, James. I'm not her father. I just rent her a room. Are you and Hannah seeing each other, James? ...You carry firearms. It's very convincing. Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.' That good, huh? Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission. He cribbed that from Borges. But where? I need the street. The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day? Crabtree? He doesn't even know James. Jesus. Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What? Listen, Hannah. You don't remember where that aunt worked, do you? James' aunt. No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around? Hey. Oh. Well. I... I don't think it really matters, Hannah. We could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point. All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa. Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was... That strikes me as odd. Hannah, are you telling me you don't know where James Leer lives? Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay? Do? I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get. I thank you. James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree. The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly? He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right? Me? Sure. Why? Thanks for that. He all right? Yes, Hannah? You don't deserve me, you know. In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers. Does he still love you? Did you tell Walter? I guess you have to go on faith. I went and looked at some babies just now. Ouch. How many? I know. I lost it all. I'm through improvising. I'm so glad to see you, Sara. And what did you say? He told you. I think I might've said I was in love with you. I think I might have. Would Walter really press charges? Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back. Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night. Someone stole my car. Over there. In the backseat of the... Inside. I'm sorry, Sara. I've been trying to tell you. It's all my -- Oh? Sara. I'm sort of helping him work through some issues. James Leer. About the baby. I know that. I know what's at stake here... Really, Sara, I... No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something. Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to... Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell... Really? That was fast. A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning. I heard. Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk? You got me. Caps. It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore. Well, no, I don't see any way. And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance. Not have it. I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me. No, really, Sara, I don't think you -- Well... Nothing. I think I twisted my -- Is the thing -- is it over? Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey. No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do. Yes. If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening. Hm. Simple. She's left the room before. She always came back. Emily left me this morning. Well. This is... surprising. Does Walter...? All right. This morning -- New? I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is. I need to talk to you. Easy there. I got the message you called too. Chancellor. That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap. Jesus. Is that what he told you? He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit. Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one. He's writing his name in water. Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry. Listen, Antonia -- I'm not sure that's possible. James is... I don't know... I'm your man. He's still barking at me. He's blind. It's Mrs. Gaskell's. Her hobby. Lucky guess. That perfume you're wearing, Antonia. It wouldn't happen to be Cristaile, would it? The more the merrier. No. Sara. I'm in love with her. I'm in love with your wife. I... I... This is important. I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it? GRADY Tripp. English Department. It's Grady, Walter. Walter? As a heart attack. Do you get high, Sam? Yo, Traxler. Taking the long way home. Her husband. Oh, right. Yeah, that's true. He used to rub all kinds of things on it. Paprika. Ground lamb. Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know? I don't know. It might be... Oh... yeah. I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye." Listen, Hank, I'm sorry about all this. I didn't come here to upset you and Irene. I want you to know that. Oh. Right. Linda... I haven't been doing a lot of sleeping lately. My editor's in town and I have the book to finish and -- Neurologist? Why? What's wrong? I -- just want to say I'm sorry. I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand. Where's Emily, Hank? Maybe I should read it. And? What made you pull out that old thing? Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up. I might have his number on campus. Just kidding. The perpetrator. That's weird. I could be wrong. What happened anyway? Horses, right. Vernon something... Hardapple. Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.Thank you. It's the Chancellor. No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy. You snore. Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams. Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something. You all right, Professor Tripp? The candelabras were my Gran's. Hey. What are you guys doing here? We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time. Actually... I just want to go home. That's just how my brain works, I guess. Even if I end up going to jail.... Professor Tripp...? Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled. I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp? Does she mean -- does she know about... her dog? I'm fine, right. Fit as a fucking fiddle. Can I -- I mean -- do you mind -- if I wear this again. Professor Tripp? That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement. I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak. She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me. Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton. Parents? They're not my parents. They're my grandparents. My parents are dead. I'm not going, with them. I'm not going with them. Where you going? Okay. When? It's because you don't eat. What would you call them then? That's why you're having them. Your spells. Want a bite? You coming? Arsonist's Daughter meant something. I'm sorry. But, last night... It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and -- Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself. Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself. You're lying. Jealous? Of me? Because of my coat? It's warm. So, why did you take me up there? Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act. You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog. You're mad at me, aren't you? Probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night. I just wanted a little sip. It feels really... good... here. It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk. Maybe she didn't come here. Want one. They're incredible. Incredible. You can see the outline of a butt. Someone jumped on your car with their butt... The one that left you? Kinship. And what's here? This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself. When we fall, we fall hard. I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt. Whatever kind they wanted her to be. Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer. It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years. Outside Scranton. Carvel. It's a bit of a scandal. My parents live in a small town. Colon cancer. It's my father. He gets it from his doctor. Humboldt County? I've got a thing about, places like this. I know what those houses are like. I know what the people are like. No. She seemed to take it pretty well. I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me. Isn't this...? Who? A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection. It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff. The bus station. There is, but it's not that interesting. I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave. How's that? And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad? How did I get here last night? Professor Tripp? Blocked. Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were... Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but -- That's a big book you're writing. I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced? Yes. He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior. The guy on the phone. He didn't give his name. Want me to get that? I guess there's probably a story behind that. I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something. I guess you really miss her, huh? I put you on the floor. Thank you. Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP! Mmhmmm... knap... sap... This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out. No thanks. I'm fine without them. Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay? Can I ask you something about her? Whose tuba is that anyway? That's a big trunk. It fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly. Does she want to hear it was one of her professors? You? What are we going to do with... Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question? Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing. No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought -- I had to. Didn't I? You mean, with your wife leaving you and all? Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note. I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad. I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this. You're really good friends with the Chancellor, aren't you? It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot. They're glass. The buttons. Really? The one she wore on her wedding day? Is that really it? I'll miss my bus. I saw a movie once. Part of it took place in heaven. Everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. Like that. At least that's the way I remember it... Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven... It's colder in there. A little. I have trouble sleeping. While I'm lying in bed I figure them out. The stories. It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write. They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones. It's not bad. So did Gene Tierney. She's in it too. Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer. You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp. She likes old movies like I do, that's all. Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic. No! What gave you that idea? It's just... for good luck. Some people carry rabbits' feet... It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps. It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school. Pier Angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. Charles Boyer, 1978, pills again. Charles Butterworth, 1946, I think. In a car. Supposedly it was an accident, but, you know... He was distraught. Dorothy Dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. Albert Dekker, 1968, he hung himself. He wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. Alan Ladd, '64, more pills, Carole Landis, pills again, I forget when. George Reeves, Superman on TV, shot himself. Jean Seberg, pills of course, 1979. Everett Sioane -- he was good -- pills. Margaret Sullavan, pills, Lupe Velez, a lot of pills. Gig Young. He shot himself and his wife in 1978. There are more but I don't know if you would have heard of them. Ross Alexander? Clara Blandick? Maggie McNamara? Gia Scaia? There's so many... Pills. August 25, 1972. In a Costa Brava hotel room. George Sanders? No, I'm going ho --Hang you like the witch you are, unless-- --the witch kills children-- There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there-- That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week. Druid Hill Park.

I didn't see anything. Does it hurt? Fine. This is a little nuts. What? That made her lose the baby? Hey, chill , man-- Well, please keep me fucking informed! Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel? My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there! How'd you know they were-- One set. Everything from midnight on-- --yeah, the goddamn stoners!

Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis. I think we get the gist. And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there? This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go. --scared the living shit out of us. You want me to scooch over next to you? Baby names? You said the name "James." Anna-- Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening? Your body, your call. Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise. Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together. No offense, sweetheart: fuck you. Your parents didn't have a bigger one? No-- this is weird. The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr. --brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858-- Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an old tree. It's a sketch , Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus-- --chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism. Yes . No. --or one huge attack of group hysteria. -- myth -- --whatever; that's her. That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown. Jesus. So says her website. Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired. Cheery little place. Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her? What? --shit!!! What're you nuts-- I can't! I thought all your equipment got stolen. I think it's time to get out of here. Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else. How much of that stuff you guys been smoking? Well, she's got to be somewhere here. It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay? You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep. --still go see the OB in the morning-- What-- --great: we can watch Domini sleep for hours--or, shit, maybe if we stay at it for a couple of days, maybe a deer'll dash by! Running a junk yard. Just one lock in this neighbor- hood? Let's get inside. I dunno it's safe to even get out of the car. They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be just the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't. Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes? --I dunno, I just woke up-- Asleep-- How're the cameras doing? Look, guys, we're cold, we're tired we're shook --we just want to get out of here as soon as there's light. We saw something up at Coffin Rock today-- No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone. --now there. Look over there. It's a serious sociological study. Now you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left. This isn't about us. You drive, I'll handle the video, okay? We're all going to be if you don't hit the brakes. Cotter? We're not making Blair Witch II here. --turn the goddamn camera off! --Cotter-- --Graduate Thesis-- --turn the camera off-- What? Someone want to tell me what's going on-- What? Pointless. That's almost a year's worth of work! Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus.... Smells Like Teenage Spirit. You planning on sleeping out there? Ah, Domini? --sacred and occult Scotch Tape. Ancient runes-- She got paid . See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful-- We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek. Ruins of the Rustin Parr house. I don't.... There are other explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane! It's possible for chrissake-- Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing. Why? What the fuck's going on here? I thought all witches were benign and good. Anna-- She's far from "fine." I should check on Anna. --or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods. Or a blood blister--or a bruise. Don't! You're making me lose my grip. Domini's the only logical explanation. --why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place? Domini. Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck. I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams. There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs. You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna-- Okay. Hypothetically. Heather. Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little-- --I know! Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking go -- she won't leave this place. Finally got her back to sleep. Whatever. They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them. --bullshit--I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling... IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still looks like we're eighteen. Better than a pile of dead teenagers. I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m. is there anything you do? If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today. So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex. She's my daughter, Tom. Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston? I just wanted to check that you were okay? But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends. No. Run! Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school. What did you hear? You were eavesdropping. Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today. It can't be. Are you sure? I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep. I'm not. No honey. Ok. You never went, uh, all the way? I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to. How much further? I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further? Well, I assume you let him kiss you? I have a question to ask you. A personal question. Hi honey. I want you to head right home after school. Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone? How well did you know Stacy and Rod? Hi honey. They're not all the sheriff's daughter. Goodnight. You said that two weeks ago. Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss. You're grounded Friday night! It's almost ten o'clock. I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Are you sure? No? No. I'll handle this. There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going. What kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'Think I'll nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'? She's underage. What are you doing? No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep. She's still a virgin. Is Jody still awake? Two kids were found mutilated in the woods. Lock the door after me. Why? Really? No, you couldn't. No. Is there a picture of her somewhere? I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here. Can you get inside? Can you describe her? How old was she? She was murdered? Of what? She works at a church? You know where I can find her? I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.No. I couldn't do that. I have something for you. Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go. Your brother told us. I know where you're going.Pretend we're just another couple. Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there. I love you. Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away. He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here! I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party. Jody. Wait. Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party. Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me. Sharon's far from a slut. That's not why we broke up. Yeah. Just making me feel like a piece of meat. Are you coming to the party? I don't know. I kind of am. But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody. I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends. All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid. Yes! They're not picking me up until six. I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together. Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him. If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it. Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose. You know I want to go with you. Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me. Why? I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash? I heard you got attacked. Are you O.K.? Jody, we've been going out for over a year. I love you but I'm all out of patience. You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people. Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you. So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter. Why? I'm worried about someone. I got to go. There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught. Just thinking about something.Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport. Thanks. I'll keep it in mind. Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here. You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions. What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors. 250,000? All of them. Fax these to this number, okay? What's she doing here? I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon? What the hell is this doing here? You shouldn't judge, Brenda. Whoa. Remind me. Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client. What do you think? What's this? Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time? The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me. Take it. Okay, fine. Fine You backed me into a corner again. You're holding me hostage ... "I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..." The extortion, the threats ... Oh, okay. Here it comes. You see your office? Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance. But I know you're not gonna quit on me. The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history. I did. Both. I was wrong. I don't know what to say. Ho - ly - shit. Erin? What are you -- Erin -- Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon. This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come. You're not gonna be there. Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse. I know . We're having a meeting, it's all set up -- Hey, that's not so bad. Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime. So in legal terms, ten years is -- Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal. Because. They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of -- With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money. Uh-huh. I'm not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin. Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ... No one's taking anything -- Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't -- You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun -- Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money -- Okay, look. It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers -- Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest. Erin, it's just a meeting. Gee, I wonder why. Because that's how people treat each other ! Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect -- He's got a reputation for doing all his -- Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to -- It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case. Their lawyers go -- Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter. It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars. Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ... And it's less than pocket change for PG&E. I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision. 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever. But ... It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff. Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it. I'll see what I can do. Is that what you want? Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with -- Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or -- I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind? I was just asking. Are you all right? He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make? What kind of truck? What? Who? He said he'd be at the gas station at six. Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday. They're trying to intimidate us. Tell them to wait in the conference room. From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously. Hey. I like working with you. I would now. Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about. I like this case. Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is. Show me the document that proves that. PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley. We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco. Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something. Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work. No shit. Jesus. I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk. They skipped that step. And that's what caused the contamination? I don't remember seeing any ponds up there. You wanna talk about -- Is that what I think it is? What now? Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy. Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on. This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal. You think there's more? How many families we talking about here? Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that? I know how DNA works, Erin -- -- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm. It's not about working hard -- Because I said no. Look -- the only reason PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility. No, thank you. Hunh-uh. Absolutely not. Then I don't get anything either. Erin -- Erin -- Yeah. Isn't that a shame? What, you think I'm made of money? Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world. That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you. It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice. I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting. Find out. This is the only thing you found? A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line. Okay. A 5% raise, and -- Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense. Lemme see it, will you? That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you? I didn't see any medical records in there. What medical records? So what made you think it was? But, PG&E told her about the chromium? So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff? I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun. Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun. He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel. Come on, I'm trying to help here. Okay, enough -- Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf. Find you something else, okay? That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off. Erin, you've been gone for a week. How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl. You're a girl. Good. You do know how to do that, don't you? Oh. Huh. Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing. A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it. Where's Anna? Bullshit, you don't. All I have is hundreds. Jane's the office manager. She handles payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early on Fridays. Yeah? Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a r�sum�, make an -- I'm sorry about that. Really. But -- I never lied. I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but -- You did? Wow, sorry about that. Listen, Mario's a little not so bright. He seems to think that you said -- I'm sorry, Erin. Okay -- let's try and settle down here. I told you the questions might get a little personal -- If you hadn't used profanity -- Yeah. I know. Right. Corey. Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em. Yesterday.... or lemme guess -- toxic waste? How does someone get meningitis? Jesus. Meningitis? What the hell is meningitis? Promise you'll turn around if you get tired. We'll just be a minute. Get a little more sleep. Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast. You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick. Think you could learn? Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find. How long's this whole thing gonna take? They up? I don't do favors for you anymore. Hello? Mm-hm. Fine. I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon. I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be. More than you need me. Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time. I know. But still. Six months. I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend. Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em. It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time. About this. Thinking. Bull shit , Erin. Bullshit. Fuck you. Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am -- It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while -- Lock the door. I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here? I'm bored, and so are the kids. Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball." Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking. What do you want, a joke? I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you. Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy? If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so. You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean? It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there. Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here? Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger. I'm just saying -- One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else. You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me. You are someone. You're not nothing, Erin. What? But you been working so hard -- It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator. I'm gonna clean it up. Fixing a leak under your sink. What do you mean? I guess we get what we pay for, huh? I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too. This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know. Better safe than sorry. Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we? Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady. Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them. Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it. Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you? I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap. I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to. I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons. How? Yeah, and whose fault is that? Why not? You need help with your kids? I could probably do that. C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night. You got a little girl? Ten? You got more than one? I do. Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness? Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours? Just introducing myself to the neighbors. Well, hello to you, darlin'.So what are we gonna do, Jack? Is this another one of those Sun Tzu �Art of War� tricks? Excuse me? It�s not good. Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We�re not sure which one, Julia�s on it right now. Word is they�re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company. The Global people are up in arms. They say we should�ve been prepared for this. We�re in trouble here, Jack... Jack, are you okay? I don�t think you�re hearing me. ...that�s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile. What about me? I�m sure you do... I�m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack. Really. So you�re projecting what, a tad over two million? Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year? Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark... Uh huh. The retail end, I understand. A broker? Really. And now you�re in the tire business? You have kids, Jack? Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here... Why Jack? You're right, Jack. Sorry... Jack approaches Alan. I don't know. Maybe... Sorry, Jack. I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner. You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man... Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? You�re doing well... Wait a second... Jack...Jack... I never won anything in bowling. How�d you know my name? I don�t care if you�re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can�t park here. Hey, you can�t park that thing here. So Jack, it�s your wife�s birthday, got anything to say to her? All I�m saying it there isn�t a guy in Union County who wouldn�t give his left nut to be married to Kate... C�mon, Evelyn Thompson�s got no class. She doesn�t marry Dr. Steve, the woman�s living in a trailer. Screw the rules. I�m talking about the choice. Look, maybe I�m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtation�s harmless but you�re playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever. Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. You�re not actually gonna cheat on Kate? Oh yeah... What is it about you? She said that? She is relentless. Hey Jack, you�re all flush. I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you. You�re right. Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare... Where�s your follow through? Where�s your stance? Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god�s sake! Look, you fit the profile exactly. Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities. You start thinking...this isn�t the life I dreamt about. Where�s the romance, where�s the joie de vivre? Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can�t have... You see, it�s like we�re in each other�s heads... It�s not Kate, is it? Trouble at work? What am I saying? You don�t need to hear that... All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that�s all. Is that you? I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays... Maybe I don�t say it enough but you moving in next door to me... I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. It�s throwin� everybody off. What do you think?You know what the word glimpse means, J? It�s by nature an impermanent thing. C�mon, Jack... Look Jack I�m late. I�d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business... Happy trails. Do I look like I live in a bottle? Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you. Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me? Do I look like I need your money. It doesn�t work like that and I can�t tell you why. As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable. Figure it out. You got plenty of time. Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of �em take a couple seconds... ...some of �em take a lot longer... It�s a glimpse, Jacko. You? What about me? I�m working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved... Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you. You�re making a business deal... No? C�mon, Jack...I�ve got everything I need, I don�t have regrets, that�s just not for me... sound familiar? Look, I don�t know what you�re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself. Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack... Basically, it�s my car now. Get in. It�s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract... Miss me, Jack? Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this. You brought this on yourself... You still think this is about me, don't you? Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all. You just said everyone needs something. Yeah? What do you need? Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved! Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me? Yeah, in most cases that'd be true. You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person. Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off... So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that. A lucky streak, huh? You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him. I call all you white guys "Jack." Damn, you are the real thing... Yes you do... DO YOU WANNA DIE?! You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making... What!? Look at the ticket...! What're you talkin' about? ...06...14...18...48...right there. Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... Merry Christmas and shit...Adelle? Hello? I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon. She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing. No... I took the road less traveled, Adelle. God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight... She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay. Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton... Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her... Her assistant? Kate Reynolds... Ooh, my suits are ready... You too? This holiday's about giving, Adelle. And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone... Lifesaver? No. But I think I like you better this way... What�s going on here? Oh, I�m hearing you, Alan. That�s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I don�t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... So do yourself a favor and don�t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office. Good for you. Why shouldn�t you protect what�s yours. Seven. Really. You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You�re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch... Take you, for instance... And I know people. It�s okay, Alan. I get it. I�m in your shoes, I�m thinking exactly the same thing...but here�s the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, it�s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they�re gonna send their kids to college. It�s just people... Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger... Well, Alan, I think we�re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account. We did one point seven million in total revenue... Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service. That�s right. And auto supply... I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton. Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones. I can see that, Alan. Mr. Mintz. Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end... I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why? You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan? Is that tonight? No, honey. Go back to sleep. What are you doing? Ah. A classic... Very nice. What is it? Right. That�s a major oversight... So if I�m Kate...I can�t really afford the finer things, my husband�s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I�m trapped in suburbia... Maybe there�s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something. Don�t you think that�s a little gimmicky? Like what? Big Ed�s? Big Ed�s Tires? Why...? Where do I go now? Got it. Good tip. Five thirty. Okay. Check... Sure. I think I could figure it out. On a case by case basis... Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right? Who did? I don�t know... This isn�t my real life. It�s just a glimpse... Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could�ve been really good friends... Yes, that�s it...yes, we went to high school together. Yes...Jack Campbell... We bowl together. We�re bowlers ...we won a championship...we�re winners. Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please... It�s me, Jack... It�s your birthday? Today? What�s your name? Where were you born? Hey, is that really necessary? I�m telling you, those rules don�t apply to me, Arn. It wouldn�t really be cheating... It�s complicated. So could you write down her exact address? Pretty much. She wants to have an affair with me. I just saw Evelyn Thompson. Hey, I�m doing the best I can... I�d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers... Damn... It�s just two kids, right? Kate�s my wife... I don�t think so. Is it...? I�m having kind of a bad day. We�re friends, aren�t we? Great room... I mean it. From what I can tell, we�re a mom and pop operation, we�re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier... I�ve got all the time in the world... Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise it�ll be returned! Where�s my car?! Where�s my Ferrari!? I�ve got kids, I�m going home... You can�t do this. You can�t keep coming in and out of people�s lives, messing things up... But what do I do? What�s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it? That�s it? That�s all I get?! A glare?! Figure it out? Figure what out?! Why not? Look, I just want my life back. Now what�s it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Let�s talk turkey! How much money...? How much time?! I asked you a direct question! A glimpse of what?! I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse! Please. Just tell me what�s happening to me. In plain English. None of that mumbo jumbo... Give me my goddamn life back! You mean because you thought I was cocky I�m now on a permanent acid trip?!! Brought what on myself?! I didn�t do anything! What the hell is happening to me?! What?! That�s my car! You stole my car! Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too. Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work... I've got everything I need. Me? Everyone needs something. I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities... I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back... What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret... Hey... I don't do that. That's just not for me... There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately. How'd you know my name was Jack? Like I said, it's a business deal... Look, I'm talking about a business deal here. I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter... ...doesn't have a death wish ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars. No. It would help me if we were. Is there something going on between us? Are we...? You�re a nurse? Something like that. Evelyn, right? Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me... I don�t think so, thank you... It�s lovely... Maybe you�re not hearing me. I am Jack Campbell... Right here. Jack Campbell, President... Look, I don�t know what�s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company. Frank. Where�s Alan Mintz? Is he here yet? Thanks. To you too... I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. Why don�t you let me take this one, Kenny? If you�re into that kind of conspicuous consumption... Well, I�m just a little confused right now about why I work here... I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always... That�s the kind of thing you can really build on... ...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that? Thank you. Do I have a private office somewhere in the building? What are you talking about? It�s me, Jack Campbell. Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper! Just until the Deutsche Mark turns... How�d you do this year, Tony? We have two kids, Annie and Josh... Please. Let�s just go have a cup of coffee. That�s all I�m asking for. I�m sure there�s another flight to Paris tonight. Don�t get on that plane! You can�t go! Not exactly... Can we just take a minute here? Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...? You�re not married, are you? So you�re not at a non- profit firm? To Paris. Paris, France. You�re moving... Paris? What�s going on? I'm sorry... You look great. Kate... Promise me again... Please, just promise me you�ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don�t, then it�s like it never happened and I don�t think I could live with that. I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment. I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens. But I�ve done some good things too, haven�t I? Look, you�re making this into something it�s not. This isn�t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It�s a step forward... Don�t you see? I�m talking about us finally having a life other people envy. I can do that. I want to do that. For all of us. I need to do that as a man... Think about it. No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow... No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon. This is New York City, it�s like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours aren�t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here... I�m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate... I don�t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. We�ll put Annie and Josh in private schools... You�re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions. A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives... This place is a perk, Kate. Think bigger. Pretty incredible, isn�t it? I don�t think I�d fight you on that one... My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you... You�re so...beautiful... I�m out of the doghouse? I�ll just full yours up to the top. Happy anniversary, sweetheart. Good things... It�s wonderful... I guess...some of them are probably faking. Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks. That�s a big one for me, too. But you always seem so certain. Now...I don�t... I never used to be like this, Kate. I had it all figured out. No doubts, no regrets. No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different... I used to be so sure about everything, you know? I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different... Are you sure? I think it may help us but there�s a slight chance it could make things worse. I need to tell you something. But I�m gettin� close, right? What�s the difference? I�m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs... I�ll fix it. I�ll go out right now and get you something. I�ll make it right. I know that, but... Here�s the thing. I really hadn�t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. You know, anniversary�s good all day... You really are incredible... Zeena... Maybe I should wait... Wait a minute. You�re my wife? What? You make me hot... Not it...? Oh yeah, you�re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I�m gonna take you to that special place... Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear... What...? Thank you... I want it... C�mon. That�s my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken. Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it... Hey, where�s that chocolate cake...? How would you look at it? Our life in a nutshell... That�s why I work for Big Ed? You had a heart attack? Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Why�d we ever leave? No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didn�t we? Sure. I really like Annie. Surprise. We�re pregnant... Yeah...that must�ve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right? Look, I�m sorry. I�m sorry I was such a saint before and I�m such a prick now. Maybe I�m just not the same guy I was when we got married... I can�t believe it�s not a disappointment to you! Jesus, Kate, I could�ve been a thousand times the man I became. How could you do this to me? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?! What�s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes? I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I�m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere? I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I�m sick of it. I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate. Do you have any idea what my life is like? She got those shoes... It�s an unbelievable thing. Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person. I�m gonna buy it... Do what? I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there�s no question about that. But this... ...you�ve really grown into a beautiful woman... No, I�m serious...you�re really stunning... Whatever you say...honey. Shouldn�t we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...? Wait a second. You want me, don�t you? I�m working on a new deal now... Hey! I was watching that! Well that�s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful... Uh...that baby�s crying... HEY! Hello! But it�s twenty degrees outside... No, she�s not. You�re kidding me... Pro bono. You don�t get paid at all. Nobody makes a dime. Well, bravo... Yes, I�m fine. It�s just this god awful football phone! Who has a phone like this anyway?! Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom? Why not? What are you doing? Trust me on this Kate. I really don�t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time. Party? Oh no, I can�t go to a party... Look, you don�t understand. I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house... Because that�s where I live. I was in the city. I don�t know! Please stop yelling at me! Yeah...fine. You hear me complaining about that? No, you�re right. What are we doing? What? For us, Kate. You mean don�t go at all? What about my internship? About the plane? What do you think it�s gonna crash? Don�t say that... All in one tape? A shelter?! I�m the richest guy in the building...I�ve got twice the square footage you have! Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, I�ll be fine... It�s because I�m shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me? Mrs. Peterson. Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You�re a scotch man, single malt, not because it�s trendy but because you�ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand... For one thing, you like expensive things. You�re a little tougher, Peter. But you�re not interested in boutique dollars... I get it... Not exactly. I�ve seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life... Peter Lassiter... Not by a long shot. Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve... Where is he? Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter? That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin... And God love you for it. Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree. I�m sorry, no... No...I�m not... Damn...damn...damn... Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?! You won�t regret it... Tommy! Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A�s... ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume... For the money, they�re hands down the best radial we carry... Christmas? It can�t be Christmas... That�s totally see through... If it's something you feel strongly about. I've got plenty of places to go. Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like? So we'll get egg nog. Tonight. I want to see you again. You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars. Of course I did.When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over. You know what to do. That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy. Get out! Get out of the car! Get out of the fuckin' car! Don't do it! Don't do it! Easy, Billy, just open it. Let us out! They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash... I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me. No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe. Most kids do, I guess. No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design. I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane. Right. April 25th. Remember the departure time? Thirty-nine. Remember the gate number? How many died on Flight 180? From our group? He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns. Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you! That's him, but... he's not here. That... him? This place?! I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know. What if Tod... is just the first... of us? I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere. I'm... really sorry. You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits. It's only the end of June. How would I know? You think I'm some sort of... Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do! My intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design. But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design. You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead. No! It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list. Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder. Why do you think I was hiding? Look, there's something you should all know. I don't. I wish you were on the plane! Fuck you! I'll remove myself! That's a plan. And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes. C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something? Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay. No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control. Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring. I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next. No. I saw it. I saw it! I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it... I'm sorry we broke in. Design? You saying Tod did kill himself? His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son. Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide? I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...No harm. No foul. You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. ... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. And no... escapes. In Death... Cuticle lacerations. I know who you are.Yo! What you goin' for What you want with her anyway' I think by Twenty-two. I think she lives down by Pitt. I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her? The one with the phat ass? Which one?

Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy... Jules, I want you to say hello to somebody... I'm on with John - that guy I told you about. I'm serious. No. Not our Johnny. I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future. I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio. I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he... There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about. Wish you weren't. He ain't the only one. I love you, Bud. One in each ear. What would you do without me? I tucked him in at Gordo's. Nothing. I just wanted to see you. Sure. It was under control, Bud. Butchy's just getting tight in his old age. Did he? The usual. I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time. What's the matter, Jules? Trouble workin' an eight hour shift, watching the kid and whipping up a little bolognese? You alright? How about a little of the King? Hey, bud. Next time lets put some money on it. No kidding. I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW. Come get me. Satch, you gotta listen to me... In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run. Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th. The Mets are gonna win 5-3. Go watch the game, Satch. The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park. What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0. And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball. What if I could prove it to you, Satch? He's not gonna stop, Satch. He's gonna keep on... Satch, would you listen to me here. Just you and me. Can I talk to you here, alone? As nuts as that sounds, yes. I swear, Satch. Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio. No. This isn't what you think. What do you mean? About what? No, I don't. What is going on here, Satch? What are those guys doing out there? Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John. You hear me? Satch is here. John, hold on a second. I'm in the middle of something important here. You mind if... Okay, I'm on it. Hey. Luck, my ass. Yes! That's it! You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief! I'm right here behind you... You ready? No, but we can. We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief. Don't be scared. This time I'm right behind you if you fall. I'll be up soon, Little Chief. C'mon, Chief, show some guts. Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling. Okay, start pedaling. Glad to hear that. Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief. What's wrong? We did it, John. We stopped him. Satch is busting me for Sissy Clark's murder. John... John, you there? Just a minute, John...okay? Don't go away. What are you doing here, Satch? You off today? You're telling me this maniac is a cop? What the hell am I supposed to do with that one? Hang on. Huh? I got it. Okay, okay... What... How the hell am I gonna do that? What? In my pocket. No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license. He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live. John, he's got my driver's license. Johnny, I know, but... I don't think I can. I'm not a cop. I can't. I can't stop this guy. This is wrong...it's like we cheated... Yes it is...we did this. We changed everything. I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire. I was supposed to die in that warehouse. He killed her John. He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it. Don't worry, Chief. I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what. You all right? John, you still there? John, say hello to my wife...Julia. Hang on a sec, John. Wow. Yeah, you betcha. Hey, what about the Amazin's? They pull it off? What are we like in...1998? What else, John. It must be different, huh? Are people living on the moon? Tell me something good, Chief. Tell me about the future. All right, I'm with you. I just hope we know what the hell we're doing. How? Got it. Whatta we do now? No. I just kept talking to her. There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em. I'll be damned. What do I tell them? Why not just get the cops to watch the bar? What if the radio stops working? Christ, what if I can't reach you again? I don't know, John. I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different. So what should I do? Call the police? You think they'll believe me? What can we do? You don't even know who this guy is. I'll warn them. I gotta take her away, John. I'm gonna take your mother away. He can't hurt her if I take her away. What are you talking about? Whatta you mean... What kinda twisted animal. Murdered? Why? Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now. How? When? She just died, your mother just died? Whatta you mean she's not here? What? What is it? What? Johnny, what's wrong? Are you alright"? Right here, Chief. Sorry I lost you last night. Damn thing keeps cutting out. What, Johnny? What is it? I'm glad. Tell me. Yeah. I'm okay. What about you? I want to know. About you. And your mom. You're the voice of an angel, Johnny. If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it. Chief?! Is that you? I don't understand. But that's tomorrow. When? That can't be...that's not gonna happen. On the job? Why? What? What are you talking about? It's okay. I'm still here, Chief. I think I'm losing you. You're still my Little Chief, right? Too busy playin' ball, huh? It's really you, isn't it? 1998...? This is wrong. Who are you? Why are you doing this? Thirty-five? That would make it... You sound...ground up...? Yeah, that's how Hams work. We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time. How could this be happening? Johnny...? That's impossible. What's happening? What? Nothing...I just spilled something. I'm not dreaming. What the hell... 29 years...? What? W...B...2...YXB. What the hell does Gordy have to do with it? Right...and I'm asking how you called the game. Look pal, I'm just askin' how you... Frank...Frank Sullivan. Uh huh... Oh, that was my kid. Sorry 'bout that. What are you talking about? I'm talking about this afternoon. The World Series. You called Buford's homer. I been Q-ing you all night. How the hell did you do it? ...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens. CQ 15. I'm right with you, man. He's got the heart of a lion. Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series? Fed up? Lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study America, they're gonna learn about three things: the Constitution, Rock 'n' Roll, and Baseball. What? Sorry 'bout that. So Queens, you psyched for the Series? 15-band closes down at night. During the day you can chew the band with China if you want. Whatta ya know. Bayside, born and raised. Where are you transmitting from? Listen, you can't broadcast without a license. Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band. Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy? WB2YKXB, who've I got?Nicky Moore. Patty Ryan. Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole? Julia Sullivan! She mean anything? She means something to me! So, what'd you do about it, Daryl? Let me tell you what I know, Daryl. You went to Saint Xavier with Mary. You lived five blocks from her. You liked her. But she ain't interested. That must've hurt, huh? Sexual assault, Daryl. Five years. But you got lucky, right? You got away with something else. Something you figured nobody knows about. Well, I think you do. You know what I'm saying. You remember Mary Finelli? You go to Xavier High School, Daryl? I don't remember. Why don't I remember? Wait. Something's wrong. I don't... I'm here, Dad. I'm here. Yeah, Dad. What the hell is going on? Dad, what the hell is going on? Dad, you there? Call the FBI. Use a pay phone. Don't give 'em your name, Dad. Just tell 'em that it was Shepard who killed Finelli and Clark and the others. That he's the Nightingale. It's gonna work, Dad. We're gonna stop him. Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep. Please, Dad, just do it. Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners. His prints. You've got his prints. I'll run them through criminal index. You gotta get me that wallet. We got him! Dad you got him! He touched your wallet! Where's your wallet? He took your wallet? What? I need you to believe in me. To believe that we can do this. But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember? I know... But Dad, you can't go back. You didn't die in that fire. And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that. So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right. No. It's not your fault, Dad. Yeah, I think so... I'm right here, Dad. H-hi. You there? Well, game five was the big one. It turned in the bottom of the 6th. We were down 3-0. Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up. The count goes to 2 2. High fastball. He nailed it. Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th. We won, Pop. You really wanna know? We're okay...we're good, Dad. Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here. Well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer. Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli. Girl disappeared in '68. Turns out she was his first kill. Which means he probably knew her. Most serials know their first victim. I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together... Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard. Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C. Tomorrow. She's a nursing student. Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd. Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five. It's okay. This is working. This is gonna work. Did you see him? Do you know who he is? Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be. They'll question her. Whatever they tell her could change what happens. No, I want you to follow her. See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her. When they do, you call the cops. Then you get Mom the hell out. But Dad, those other women weren't supposed to die. We don't try to stop this guy, we're gonna live with that for the rest of our lives. You ever talk to a victim's family? The one's left behind? They don't act like what you'd think. There's panic and fear. But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem. And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay. But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it. Just a glimmer. But somewhere they know. They know their world is never gonna be the same. I do know. I'm a cop. This is what I do. They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad. You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment. No. Nobody got... Wait a minute. I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be. I got the case file. We know what he's gonna do before he does it. That'll never work. They'll just think you're crazy. I don't know... What about the other women? Something we did changed the case...changed history. Mom wasn't dead. But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened. And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women. He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten. Dad, we did something. Something to make it worse. There was this case. A serial. He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69. The papers called them the Nightingale Murders. They never caught him. But the killings just stopped. October 22, 1969. No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me. She...she died. It's like it just happened. She's not here. It's Mom. Something happened, something... Dad...Dad... There's... I need to... What it was like when you died in the fire... Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know. Cause I still remember. It's hard to explain. Something happened today. It was like a dream. And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times. Times we never had before. We're doing all right, Dad. We're doing good. Dad, you there? You okay? Yeah, it's me. Dad...? Don't go. Don't go in that warehouse... Tomorrow. Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen. October 12, 1969. It did, Pop. It did. It was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening. Butch told Ma it was just one wrong turn. Said it wasn't your fault. You went with the training, with your instincts. If you'd just gone left instead of right, you would've made it. Fire. I never knew you, Dad. I lost you. But you're not...you're not still here. No wait, don't go! What's that? I'm trying to be, Dad. I'm tyrin'. It's good to hear your voice. I missed you...so much. Nah, I gave it up. No, not yet. Yeah...I think so. I'm not doing anything. Look, I don't know what's going on. But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998. 1998. I'm thirty-five years old. Wait a sec...there was something on the news. Something about this space anomaly. I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69. Sun spot? I don't know. Dad...? What if it's not... You just burned the desk. Oh my god. What's going on? I'm dreaming this. Shit, this is a dream. My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan. And every night when I went to bed he sang to me... Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd... 29-years ago. Now you listen to me. My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life. And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father... What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were? Gordo, if this is you, so help me... You're telling me your name is Frank Sullivan, you live in Queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 Series...live? Is this some kind of joke? Gordo is that you? Are you fucking with me? What'd you say your name was? You call your son Little Chief? What'd you just say? This afternoon? Wasn't too tough, buddy. Game happened almost thirty years ago. Huh? Hello? Yeah. It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park. I got fed up with all the bullshit. I don't really follow baseball anymore. I can't believe people are still using these things. I thought these things were for talkin' around the world. Queens, New York. Pal, my whole life's an emergency. Look, I don't really remember how this thing works. Name's John. Uh, hello? Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live. Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy. Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it. Gordo? The Ham radio. That's how come he didn't die in the fire. Cancer. It was the cigarettes. Right? The cigarettes? My father didn't die in a fire? My father didn't die in a fire? Longbranch...? Better. The warehouse. Buxton seeds. It's tomorrow. No. I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in. I talked to him Gordo. I talked to my Dad. I think it's somewhere in the closet... if you can find it. What the hell is that smell? I'm not your uncle, kid. Gordo, what are you doing here? Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile. Yeah. Sure. What? Not the first time that's been true. I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy. This is the guy, Satch. I ran him through BCI...got a hit. Busted for sexual assault: March 22, 1970. Eight days after the last Nightingale murder. Okay, lemme walk you through it. Which means he probably knew her. Our lucky break. Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968. That's what we need here, Satch. A lucky break. Ten? No. I remember this case. Three. He killed three women. I'm sorry. I just...you know...I... Yeah. That's it. Gordo, I wasn't dreaming. I talked to him, it was real. Whoa, I just...I just... She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it. Yeah. I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her. I try to be. She's pretty special. Yeah...I remember. I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun. Yeah, that's right. Look who's talking. I know. I'm sorry. Work. So how'd you like LION KING? No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90! So how are things at the hospital? Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy. Sounds good. Hey, Ma, it's me. Checking in. Probably at work. Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night. Love you. It's a small world, Carl. And I'm gonna find you. Real soon. You have the right to speak to an att -- Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right... I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet. Talk about dumb luck. Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it. Bets part is she's the first victim. She knew the doer. I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking. No. Missing teenager. Disappeared thirty years ago. Found her bones last week. Buried behind some old diner, up by Dyckman street. Mary Finelli. As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders. Nah, just working the job. The 2-3. Homicide. I look familiar? You used to be on the job? Oh. Sorry. How so? Wife around? Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."Get him home safe. You missed a hell of a game, Frank. Frank. We know. We know it's Shepard. Deleon. Go watch the game? Go watch the fucking game? Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer. It matches the Nightingale's profile. You understand what that means? Frank, this is insane... Frank, please... How's that? Are you listening to me? You're in a world of shit. An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment. We got your prints all over the place. Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank. You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe. Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl. Uh, huh. Uh, huh... Uh, huh. And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in? You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio. I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it. 415 Greenwich St. #302. Under the body of a murdered woman. Do you know where I found this? Let's go. Do us both a favor. Let's go outside and talk. We need to do that. I think you know, Frank. I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside. Frank, we need to talk... Hello, Frank. Lucky throw, fire boy. He ain't our guy, John. Got a minute? I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy. Uh, huh. So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street. Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself? Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better. This case just got hot. We pull on this string... April 16...? That means she was the first. That wasn't luck, Johnny boy. That was smarts and ten plus on the job. What're you talking'? You know better than anybody, John. You've read this file a thousand times. She makes ten. And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys. I don't need 'em. What I need is a partner I can count on. I care about you. Not cause of me and your old man. Not cause of your mom. But because of you. This is getting real old, John. And I'm tired up to here with it... Another rough night, huh? That it? Maybe you outta lay off a little... You're not looking too good. Nothing you're willing to do. Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him. 'Good.' Yes. I told him. Nothing. What could I do? Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and two of his boys arrive with Frank and tell me that he's rumbled. Somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. They ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat. I thought they'd just duff him up a bit. Honest. Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen. No choice. I had a visit from somebody. A couple of weeks back. I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret. Yes. I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird. I know. I know. I know. Hello, Jack, I don't know anything, Jack.You knew what I'd do. What did he say? Did Eric know that Frank was my brother? What did you do? Albert? Do you want to be dead, Albert? And you told Brumby? Who? How? When did you find out? How? Did Eric Pake pull her? You can't get away from me, Albert. Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you. Was he? How'd it happen, then? What about the brakes? Was the steering faulty? Yeah. This is my brother's car. What happened to this car? You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank. Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits. Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so? Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on. That's not good enough. Why? Why? What name? Yes. You're a big man, but you're in bad shape. With me, it's a full- time job. Now behave yourself. Never mind. I made a mistake. I made a mistake. I know. You must be joking, Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit. Address? Where's he living these days? Who sent you, Thorpey? Yes you can. Who paid you to see me off? Oh, really. You're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, Thorpey? That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank? What happens if I miss the train? You stay in the car. I'll come and listen. What you want to tell me, Thorpey? That's nice. Good evening. You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him? I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that. I'm the villain in the family, remember? What was bugging Frank? Once a week you like a gentleman? I call that regular. Why'd you see him so regular? Though nicer than most? But he was just another feller, wasn't he? Nothing more? Just another feller? How were things between you and Frank? Tomorrow morning, then? I want to talk to you later. Really. Hold it! Hold it! Who killed Frank, Margaret? What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone. Doreen. Fine... I want to talk to you. Well, it's Carter. That's my name, And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed. And you didn't know her last name? Now tell me the truth. Did my brother Frank find out? Then he must have pulled her. Who set it up? Eric? Is it one of Kinnear's films? Was it Albert? The young girl. Who pulled her? Tell me about the girl. I want to give you an Oscar. Sure I'm sure. Not entirely. No. Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap? What kind of entertaining? What does he want that bloody great country place for? Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out? Is he coming here? Who's setting you up in this place? And what was that? He must have been pretty sure I'd come. Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk! How'd you know where I'd be? Of course. Where else? So where are we going, Princess? No. I didn't know that. Yeah, I'll do you a favour. Was he? While he was here. You went about together? Really? No. Really? Go on. No, do you really? Oh, do you? Who? Yes, I do. I work for him. What? Thanks for coming. Look, look. Get your suit cleaned. Have another? Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that. Yeah. A bloody funny thing! Nice of you to come. Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again. There. Go and get your hair done. Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that? Where's that? Where you going to live, then? You coming to South America? You all right now? That must be interesting. Oh, what you doing now? How's school? Tell me, Doreen, did the police say anything? Sorry about your father. I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate. All right. All right. I want to square things with you first. No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry? Did they give you a rough time? What happened to you, then? Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff Brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. Right along the coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey? Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine? Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea? Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set. How many? Las Vegas. See you later. Good lad. That's nice. What'd you tell him? Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time. Large Scotch. Went to school with him. He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town. Where would I find him? I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift? Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right? You work here, Keith? Nobody seems to know. Since when did he drink whisky? Why would it? That's what I was wondering. Did you work with him, Keith? What? How could I stay away? I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'. I don't want to get rough, do I? They're friends of mine. No chance of that. Do us a favour? No. I'm not tired, Do you eat breakfast? Are you tired? Yes, thank you. You must be joking. I never eat breakfast, Did you sleep well? No. Think about it. 'Cos I know you wear purple underwear. You wouldn't. So shut up. What am I supposed to do? I don't know where they've taken him. Do you? Pension him off. What about Keith? That little shit! You're lucky. They kill as well. Don't ask me. They came back? Ta-ra. Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ... No, you won't. Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch. Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right. No. Really, I am. I'm sorry. Funny. Can I phone London? My brother, Frank. I'll bet this one's seen some action. You sure? Very nice. I'll pay you for tonight as well. Definitely. It's not like that, luv. I'm staying with a friend. I won't be using the room tonight. Eh? Have a drink. You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric. Not till I'm dead, Eric. Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it? You should have told me who you were working for. Yes, I retained that, Eric. Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric? They're still the same. Piss holes in the snow. Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension? Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like. So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good. And you should know, if I remember rightly. I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy. Yeah, Come off it, Eric. Who is it? What are you doing? Advertising Martini? Very... So, who you working for these days Eric? That's all right, Eric. A bereavement. A death in the family. It would be. If they were still living. No. I'm visiting relatives. Funny, that. Didn't you know this is my home town? Eric. Eric Paice. Is he? Yeah, I'll do that. Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I? I have to. Things to see to. Yes. Yeah. No? Funny that. Neither did I. Yep. Scotch, please. Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.Still got your sense of humour. Sod off. You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you. He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in. Cyril didn't like it, either. Jack! I didn't like that. Can't say I do. Still got a sense of humour? Making a living. That's not always a healthy way to be... What's it to you anyway? Oh, you've been watching television. Oh, I'm straight. Respectable. Well, well. Small world, isn't it? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Meaning what? Oh, that's nice. Thanks. So what're you doing? On your holidays? No, I didn't know that. What you doing around here then? Jack Carter.Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it? Oh yes? How? Get knotted. No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back. How'd you find me? Yeah. Who's Brumby? Four of them. Thorpey. They were waiting for us in the car park. Where you off to? Nowt. Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake. That's what he was saying about you. Heard of a man called Thorpe? What you having, Jack? How'd you know Albert? Today? At the races. He always goes. Yeah. He comes in here a bit. Right. Yes. Don't know. It just would. He was always the same. Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed. I mean, what for? At the Half Moon. I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work. He was always on time. I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.Fifty cars. Fifty cars by 8 AM Friday. Or Kip goes in that box. That was the deal ... Goddamn, it ... That was the deal ... Look at it. I can't very well make delivery of that thing ...

Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled... Grow up. You don't kill people like me. People like me die in their sleep at 87 ... Do you know why? Because if you did kill me, and everyone knew it was you - for the next ten years they'd be finding pieces of those you love scattered all over California ... My point. Yes. Simple, really. I require the best. I insist on the best. I only engage the best. Your brother. His friends. They came to me. They wanted my paper. He was your brother. You were the best. Now. They've brought so much goddamn heat down, I may not be able to fill this order. Which would be very bad for me. Which in turn, is very bad for them... Now. Where were we? Oh, yes. Kip. Yes ...

About what? Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking -- Hey, you want something to eat ? Nah. It's a scratch. You're kind of cultivating a new look. I heard you were pumping gas - Cool. So you're living up North? Yeah, man. Where is your beer? Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ? All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww... This has nothing to do with any of that -- I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it - Yeah ... It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look - Hello, Memphis -- Hospital. Shit ... Now, we go - I gotta get my tool -- Pop the trunk, Tumbler. But don't worry, man. Things are all sweetness and light here... No problem -Point-five ... My version of "take this job and shove it..." Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on How they were just there ... Waiting on us ... The fix was definitely in ... I think about that night a lot... Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce You have a Hollandaise sauce ? Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke." Fish. What's with the fish thing -- ? Jesus ... Who was the job for? Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley... It seems she neglected to mention it A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost? What kind of job... ? Tell me about Kip - Six years ... What about? What are you doing here? How's the leg? You got no choice. It's over. What do you mean -- ? Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him... You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ... This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ? Get out -- Get out of here, Ray -- Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ... I don't want them hurt. Any of 'em... And if he doesn't make it -- ? Sound it out for me. I'm just here about my brother. I'm not interested -- They gave you only four days? I can come up with the front money. Pay you back... I could kill you. That occurred to me. When I first heard about this. That I would kill you ... I don't want him hurt... It's about my brother ... Kip... How ya doing? Double-meaning intended -- Consider me gone, Detective -- You know my back. What do you want from me? Not my girl anymore I'm on the move - I don't think so, Detective ... You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ? Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello. You know my back. And this has what to do with me? Kip. No... A little family emergency -- You know my back. You have my word... You don't have anything on me. A misdee auto-theft. I got no record. I'll be out in three days, and back at it. Or you let them go, and I give you my word. I'm gone. And without the ringleader ... Your tee-times have just grown exponentially... Let them go. And I'll leave ... Let them go -- How's Atley -- ? You know my back - Not at all ... Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ... No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ... The other day.... Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart... How's it going -- ? And there she is -- I know. Weird, huh -- ? That's right. Only 10 exotics ... Forget that ... You know where the others are? How you doing, man? We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all You remember that, Kip? Mother -- ! Kip and I'd probably be working at the dealership... Imagine us selling cars? You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died? What time of year? He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ... You getting my checks ... ? He's in some trouble ... Why didn't you tell me? Atley Jackson came to see me ... No. How's Kip? You, too, Ma... Thought I'd go for a ride - Shocking, huh? We're clear now. It's done. I've never actually paid for a car. I want to see what it feels like She's for sale. They're asking forty thousand. Give 'em sixty ... You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ? You okay -- ? Move over ... You boost her -- ? Where'd you find this one? What are you doing here? I know ... I know. I've missed you, too Come here - Come here - Come here -- What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you? That's a good attitude, Kip. For everything but stealing cars ... That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you... Too early to tell. Nervous? You okay -- ? Having fun, Kip? What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ? As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher? What era was that -- ? Dad'd be proud -- Ain't we good-timing here ... ? Thank-you ... How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...? You spread it out, by the 2nd night, the heat are onto you. Know something's up. With a one-night boost, by the time all the cars are reported stolen, your ship's set sail. "Shadow games?" You hear me? We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean What are you doing here? You don't think so, huh? You? You? You can handle it? You can handle it? He's gonna kill you -- ! "Over--" You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron-- You just got crushed in a car. You're bleeding all over your self. And you sit there - eating olives and talking basketball, as if, at this very moment, people weren't plotting your demise ... What happened to you? I can see that - "About what?" So what are you gonna do? There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive - What do you got ... ? Okay -- Yeah -- Something like that - Yeah - You sure you're okay -- ? Sure -- You okay -- ? Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there... Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ? Just hold-on there -- You all right -- ? Kip -- ? You, too Hey, Kip ... DO IT! NOW -- ! Call 911 - How's it going? Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES. We're going shopping -- ! Okay. We're all here. Today's Wednesday. D-Day is Friday night ... That gives us two days to prep ... We're going to find the ladies on our list, find out where they live, when they're home; that they're properly insured ... Let's get into the vans -- Take it back, Freb -- Yeah. He's knows of one all right. He give you an advance -- ? Bench seats. She does have one thing you don't. What -- ? Oh, yeah. For real, point-five. I dunno. I know a place. Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride? Yeah ... You -- ? Kip's not clear yet. We got one more to go -- They got him to the hospital. He's stable ... Donny got shot ... A jacker ... And Tracy's on the move ... I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up. Let me worry about The Club ... Hear you roar ... With a twist of my wrist ... You're turned over ... I ratchet your ignition mechanism ... Now... I'm in ... I do ... I cut "em... I pop your hood; find your siren wires The alarms go off ... Unlock your button ... Slip it in ... I take out my slim-jim... Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness. I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good -- C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ? Her parole officer strongly recommended it ... No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look... Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses? A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ... No. Open her ... Ready -- ? Oh. Okay. Right. No ... No way ... Very good... I always thought you'd follow me up. Okay. That what you want? I put the boys on it. They're clever that way... They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area... Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself What's wrong with her -- ? That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway." If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ... I understand - Six or seven... Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared. Kip's in trouble And here I am... I left town. I didn't leave you. I've taken the spear for a lot of people, Sway. Including you. Can't we improvise a little here ... ? On account of Mitch? So I was replaced by Mitch? "Mitch?" Buy you a drink? You still wrenching at Bacchiochi's? The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old... See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea -- I'll see you soon -- What happened to Sway? Split it up. Any word on Donny? Robin was Robin Masters. He owned the estate they lived on ... Okay, then... Otto? His criminal career has officially come to a close ... No we don't - If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield? And the moral of that story is -- ? I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me Is he still working here ? The hard part ... Tell me... You think it can be done? He's gotten involved -- The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars? The rolled-back odometers? The part bins? Of course. Hi, Junie -- Hello, Otto ... You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up... Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions? Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ... You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ... So what's in there -- ? She soars - She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ... All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ... The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500. This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now. How old are you now, Toby? Sure. Hey, Toby. You grew up Excuse me -- Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ? You have any other answers besides "not really"? There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ? You know what you got here?Call 'em here -- ? It's going fine. The Quiet Riot and me are swapping trade secrets ... For real? Where we going -- ? Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man - You know of one -- ? Hell, yeah. Ten larger manDouble-meaning intended, right? No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...? Needs brightening ... Cadillac. Who is it -- ? That's a good one, Donny... Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO... one minute -- ! We've got several Italian cars on the list. Always tricky, always timeconsuming. So we're gonna need a specialist ... We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew... Dignity... It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx... "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ... You guys are through... Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now... She left... He's gonna be okay. Could do a bit. Ten points for our fearless leader ... Sway, how 'bout giving us the honor of the Bill Bixby trifecta -- ? Anyone? The significance of "Robin 1" on Magnum's license plate? Memphis? In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And... The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be. I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days... You need him... Some crew you got ... Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh... I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ... The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular - "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that. It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew... Are you considering a comeback tour? I heard rumors you were back. About Kip ... What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to... Whatever do you mean? You remember Junie? Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell? And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?I don't have the experience. Father Thomas should officiate. You have a sister in New Orleans. I've had it. Townsend's dead. The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church. Is he going to be okay? But bad judgement. And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be. The doctor's concerned he may never come out of this dementia. Maya, for the last time, I will not tolerate these obsessions. Please, Maya. I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense. I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before. Satan is not what you think he is. Satan is not some creature.What time did you make it for? Yes. It's exactly... Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you... Nonsense, it's all of our home. So how's work treating you? What a...jerk! I had to. There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you. You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you? Everything I did, I did for you. I love you, Peter. Think of it. I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge. It was perfect. The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away. Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn. Peter. Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you. No matter, my son, he believes in you. Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay? He spoke to you? What is it? Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith. Where are you in death without it? Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit. How're you doing? Looking lovely as always.Just me. He asked to go home early. He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do. Seemed...on edge. Quiet. Real quiet... Yes.You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you. So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire. I found the pentacle. I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer. I found them in your file box. What're these? Claire... I believe in you. I'm just temporarily off my game. It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it. Yeah, like... You're glad somebody tried to kill me? I'm gonna have to get a restraining order. What a nightmare. I can't believe Will killed him. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef. What happened? Well, it's a nice surprise. Should I hit the "stop" button? Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor? No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My favorite. Says she can get me in to see this killer. Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists. Hmmm. Uh...sure...I...what? Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards... Shi... Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest dream. It's probably trivial. It's Susan's cooking, Claire. That's why Uncle James lets them stay. She's a talk show host. They can't be charmed. By definition. Do you think they have a room here? So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural? No, I wasn't, actually. My secretary? Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor. You killed my parents. You raised me, like a son. You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did. So all that bullshit about God and faith. You fucking bastard. You know, I respect that you have such faith, James. I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will. But it's true. I have no faith. It's strange. When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened. It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything. Not eve my own life. You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it. Yeah. It didn't make any sense. Something he said, just before... You know how I feel. The world is random. The only certainty I believe in is death. You ready? It's me. Put the gun down. Maya... How much time do we have? And what's that mean? And his message was "Together, no matter what?" Terrific. What did he say to you in French? So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set? What can I do? Sure. I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter? Plenty of time. What about after? Why didn't you just go along with Townsend. Get rid of me. I would've... No oxygen to the brain. Close call. For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous. Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths? That's true. We're going to do this. What do you mean? Are you alright? What's the bible for? I don't know. Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment. That can't be right. My birthday's tomorrow. Hang on, get it up, go on, higher. What? You okay? What? What's the...OH SHIT! I'll go outside and take a look in the garage. I'm going to look around. What are you looking for exactly? When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... "The time of transformation is near..." And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me? So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong. I mean...this is ridiculous. There's been a mistake. I don't believe any of this. I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative. Yes. So what? Yes, I know. But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest. I don't understand what's going on. If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again... My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this. I'm not going to be drawn into this. You should think about getting professional help. Trick him. Why didn't Birdson just say so? What?!?! And the point is? Why did he try to kill me? Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on? We need to talk. Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents? And this is evil? The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma. Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary? So what'd I miss? I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum. It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one. I think you gave me the wrong one. The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place. I'll bet. I do. What's that got to do with you? Well, then it all seems to be working out for you. Listen, Ms...? Ooooooh-kayyyyyy. Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power. Which, to a narcissist, is impossible. A narcissist doesn't admit it. It's the extreme of self-denial. Not the most popular opinion, but yes. Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late. Not pure evil. That's correct. Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party? Yes... and you are? May I help you? ...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself. He created the voices after the fact. Get out of here. You know what? You can go. Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers. And you're already wrong on one count. I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back. I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me. I think it's gonna be a waste of time. What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo? We millionaires yet? Yeah. You know what they say. You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not. Lemme guess. The lottery. Of course. Right. If you believe in God. As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders. He created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay. Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority. Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed. As if there's another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism. There weren't any voices. No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E." That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings. Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak. Thanks for having me, Sally. Where is she now? She told me she killed them. What happened? Parents died? She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession. It's another day. I think I'm alright. What's up? Thanks again for everything. Thanks for handling this. He could see me. He's looking right at me. You're too old to smoke. Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid. Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup. What's this? Really? You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things. Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't. We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you. Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism. Not what the records show. Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since. Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion. Yeah, murder-suicide. She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13. You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk. How're you doin' today? Hey, don't thank me. Somebody up there likes you. Sure thing. Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts. You can go home. Gimme til morning. Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh? Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you. I'll quit, maybe you should start. What's the matter with you? Yeah, look at that sweet face. You'd never guess he killed nine people. I'm gonna get my smokes. Be right back. So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole. Yeah, yeah. I've heard it before. Just be sure you spell my name right. Nine o'clock? So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem. Yeah, right. I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys. I knew you wouldn't show. Hey! Mr. big shot.A horse? I don't know sometimes. Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what? You might be the only one with a job. Nah. So how long is this trip? I don't wanna see that. Damn, girl. It means a lot that you came by. Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh... It's okay. And what happens when you lose? So? What will this prove? Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on. What's that supposed to be, psychology? You're out of your mind. For what? What? Wrong. Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married. You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't. We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this? I heard enough. you woke me up to tell me that? What? What's going on? Find. What? Cause I don't get it. So why'd you give up ball? I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking. Maybe go back to school. Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else. Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that... That a nice way of saying I rode the bench? Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too. Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you... Getting there. Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny. Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company. Thanks. No. A rest? What do you mean? Figured it was something like that. Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again. Tried calling you a couple times. Funny. I never did. Still working on being the first girl in the NBA? So, how's pro-ball, Europe? Not for Quincy McCall. A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months. Yup. I'm alright. But you can sit. Thanks. Just something I'm trying. Alright. I heard you were in Spain. So...I guess I'll see you around. Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me. Few days ago. I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know? Look, I'm entering the draft. I don't think so. I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for. I'm not asking for us to be together. Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale. Never had to. Least you got your priorities straight. Stay! You forgot to be there. I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me. Least she had time for me. I just took the ho to Burger King, alright. Can we talk? We're going to get some food. Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica, Kerry. The "man" again. Yeah, sorry about that. I had this meeting with this guy. Hey, what's up. Nah. I have curfew. You know what, I'm just gonna crash. Not really. Look, this party's whack. You ready to go? Nobody. You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball? It happens, right... Here I am. What's up? For real. I should be alone, anyway. Nah. Don't sweat it. Didn't realize you were watching the clock. Why not? I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright? I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this... He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers." Man, how stupid am I. What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense... Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something... I wanted you to. Right here. Plan to. My court, I go first. Clothes. So how about a little one-on-one? Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA. You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway. So you're gonna act salty all night? Then prove her wrong. Forget Tonya Randall. It's okay, little baby. I can't help girls coming up to me. I can't be nice to a fan? What? Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all. Yeah. What was that about? You sure? When'd you get this? You had four offensive rebounds. Four. Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything. That what you think? None of your business. Figures. I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all. Guess not. Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown? You having fun? Hey. You don't look half-bad. See you made it. I don't. With a jacked-up attitude. I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you. I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head. That's it, give it your best shot. God, here we go. Your hot-ass temper. See, that's why you ain't getting recruited. So who you going to the dance with, Spalding? Didn't know you cared so much. So she's honest. And? Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me. Big-ass titties? What's that? Guess "please" would be a stretch. Your legs don't look broke. I know this. What do you want? Shut up! What? Man, forget you then, stupid. So that means I have to ride with you. My Dad always drives my Mom. Five seconds. I think we gotta kiss now. Kay. Oh. I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers. She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali. Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street. You do act different. I don't know. A lot. He's alright, but my Dad can take him. My Dad plays for the "Clippers." He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too. Same number and everything. Your Dad play? I never knew a girl that could play. So how come you could play basketball? For real? So...does it hurt? I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my cheerleader. Lucky. So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie. I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's? This is just about money, you know that. Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family. Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out. Sorry. You okay? I don't know, he had a meeting or something. Said he'd be home later. Yup. Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated. I've been hearing you. Okay. We were just studying. What are you doing in my room? Uh, your earring? We still have to go? Yeah. And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? "I told you so?" Good. I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget? Look, I'm busy. After five years. What do you want? Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary. From your mouth. Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro. So now you're saying my mother trapped you? I ain't a damn liar. And some things should never fucking happen! Lucky kid. We ain't got nothing to talk about. Still is, so let yourself out. What are you doing here? What's Mom think? Why? So what are you gonna do? Sorry. I mean, it's not true, is it? Tell me what? What? What mess? Okay... You came out early. I'm also good enough to go pro. You know, people. You work too hard, Pop. You don't wanna hurt your back. Yeah? So you up for a game later? Didn't we already have this conversation? Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way. Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man. "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it. Gotta wait til the press conference. Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball. Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been? Nona, please. What's that, not great? Keep your voice down. No, you said I should get my degree. I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold. I have. Yeah. I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude. I had some players to see and hands to shake. Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm just trying to put some things together for us. Business folks. Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting. What? Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit." Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something. You want me to fuck off? Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me. No. I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself. Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom. Came by to check on you. I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this. What? I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have. But I did it cause I love you. Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage. Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me? Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen. I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father. We need to talk. Your door was unlocked. We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years. Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart. We'll just have to see how it plays out. I'm giving her some space, couple days... A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips." This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me. I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle. No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it. It's not true. I just told you. Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you. there's this thing out there. This paternity suit. Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with. Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices. You don't have a choice. You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA? Give yourself time to develop, Quincy. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere. Well, tell them to mind their damn business. You're smart enough to get a degree. What people? Let's hope I can say the same about you one day. Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late. I don't wanna hurt your feelings. I don't care about the team. I care about the school. That's right. Why not? Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say. Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop. I know you said you didn't want any calls... Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk. Hi, Leonard. Leonard. Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway. Just two. So far. You're still paying for it. It's still Your room. Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room. Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this. This was your room. You're up in 304 now. No, let's go. This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up. Shit. Wrong room. Hi, Leonard. Seen you together, that's all. As requested. Couple days. That must suck. All... backwards. What's it like? Amnesia? Condition? You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember? You don't know? Burt. What can I do for you, Leonard? Hiya.No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something. That's it. Just loud enough to wake me up. It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. I'm not too good on the phone. I need to look people in the eye when I talk to them. A cop? That's right I did, didn't I? Yeah? I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key. You don't have to be that honest, Burt. Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me. So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump? Why didn't you clean it out? Why? When was I in here? Then why is this my handwriting? This isn't my room? What? I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key. He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay? What makes you think he's my friend? So you're holding my calls? How long have I been here? Like waking. Like you always just woke up. My wife. No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably... I have no memory. That's the thing. I have this condition. I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone. Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls - MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 I'm sorry... um... ? I'm Mr. Shelby from 304. I forget. Interested in buying one? Thanks. Don't be too hard on yourself. Who did this to you? I don't want your fucking money! You think you can bargain with me?! Strip! I don't want blood on them. Quiet! Don't say anything else. You Jimmy Grantz? Do you remember me? Jimmy? I can't make new memories. Everything fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before. I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. My name's Leonard. Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss. Who's your boyfriend? How do you know about me? I don't remember. See, I have no short-term memory. It's not amnesia - Oh. But haven't we met before? I'm meeting someone called Natalie. There's a dress code? A BEER, please. Beer, please. I remember my wife dying. Dying. My wife. Thanks. Thank you. John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage. They're not looking for him. Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this - Don't say another fucking word! Shut the fuck up! Yes. Just take it easy, this isn't my fault. Calm down. Don't talk about my wife. That's different. What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money. What? How? I'm not. Neither do I. What happened? I have this condition - What's this all about? Did you? What does he want? Who? What's wrong? Why would you do that? Me? Why would he be interested in me? Yeah, I hated it. My wife used to call me Lenny. Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy. I'll go see him. Where is he? And what did he say? Who? Kill him. What do the police think? Who did he go to meet? What happened? It's not easy to be calm when - She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes. I know the feel of the world. I know how this wood will sound when I knock. I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up. Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much. I know the feel of the world, and I know her. There are things you know for sure. Course not. What? Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy. So I just take your word? How do I know he did that to you? That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?! Who is he? What have you got me into? Yeah. You? Don't remember. Sorry. Sounds perfect? What do I owe you? Deals? She was beautiful. Perfect to me - Why? So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo. The world doesn't disappear when you close your eyes, does it? My actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. My wife deserves vengeance, and it doesn't make any difference whether I know about it. Then you shouldn't have to ask. Have I told you what this man did? You know him? Yes. So you have information for me? Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny. Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition - She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her. I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories. Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me? Then why are you here? We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal. Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next - You've read it a hundred times. How can you read that again? It is now. I should kill you. Your name's Teddy. Why would I do that? You probably. So who are you saying he was? Why do you keep lying to me? When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different! Somehow, I'll know! Yes, I will. It makes all the difference. But he's not the right guy! She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong with you? My wife wasn't diabetic. I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and - I never said he was faking! I never said that! Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - ! That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy - What the fuck are you talking about? He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy? This is a drug deal?! I don't know. See, I have this condition. Maybe. Maybe just. He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you? There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor! You're not coming? How do you know him? How do you know this? Envelopes? Why not? Why? How'd you know I was in here? Yeah, well, thanks for the advice. I didn't sell - Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered. I have money. Like what? What sort of questions? Why? Happy now? Why are you following me? Why not? MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99 Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you? From who? What do you mean "bad news"? Why's that? Who's she? Unfinished business. Prove it. Who the fuck are you? I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about. What's wrong with this one? Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him. I'll ride with him. You follow. Shut it, Teddy. It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun. I don't know. We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding. We've got to get him out of here. Why? No. No, just let me think for a minute. I might have fallen asleep before I did. I don't think so. You don't know him? Why are you here? Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key. Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have. He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live. Why? Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay? Why? Who? It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis? It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts. Guess I've told you about my condition. Things change. Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back? I'll be waiting. John Gammell? Mr Gammell? I don't remember. You know it? You're in a playful mood. I guess I've told you about my condition. Shut your mouth! I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm - Teddy! Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!From what? Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you? I think I know her. Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable. You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who you are. You can't just take it! Quit it! You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why you're so good at it. My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John G's for us to find. All you do is moan. I'm the one that has to live with what you've done. I'm the one that has to put it all together. You just wander around playing detective. You're living a dream, kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life. A romantic quest which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture. To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G. No. You took them out. Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him, I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your wife's death. I believed you, I thought you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife. We found him and you killed him. MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A. You know, when we found your guy and killed him. That's right, the real John G. Over a year ago. I helped you find him. He's already dead. I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't. You won't remember! No, you won't. Why? You're never going to know. What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not? I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol' Jimmy down there. Are you sure? Sammy didn't have a wife. You exposed him for what he was: a fraud. Sammy was a con man. A faker. Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" - I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin - You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember? That, and your thing. Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead. No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing? What's wrong? Wouldn't be appropriate. I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch. 'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you. He knows you're no good on the phone, so he calls you up to bullshit you. Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so he slips something under your door to frighten you into answering your phone again. He's been pretending to help you. Feeding you a line of crap about John G. being some local drug dealer. Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this. The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back. Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself. That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? Like how'd you get this car? That suit? The sort of questions you should be asking yourself. How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions? I won't be happy until you leave town. I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her. She has no idea who I am. She couldn't. Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you. She's gonna use you. To protect herself. She's involved with these drug dealers. Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie. Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy. Teddy. Your buddy. Natalie who? So what are you gonna do now? You like it? Let's trade. Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car. So was he scared? Give me your keys. Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag. We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson. Fucking hope not. How'd ya get him in here in the first place? He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him. Natalie? Natalie who? I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what - Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down? No! Should I? You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. Probably left it in your room. You're living. You really want to find this guy? Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures. Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy. The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right? Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right? You don't have to remember to be hungry. Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch. So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy. You said you were leaving town. Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over. Lenny, is that you? Yup? Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building. Why are we going there? What the hell you want to go there for? This is your car. Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy. Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become. That's who you were, you don't know who you are. Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name. Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help. You lie to yourself! You don't want the truth, the truth is a fucking coward. So you make up your own truth. A load of amphetamine I told him I had. His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check your tattoos. This bad cop. He checked you into the Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you for days, sticking envelopes under your door, telling you shit. Why would I have a gun?Hugh, I'm impressed.. In the envelope in my pocket. My right.. jacket..pocket.. Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card. You're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance, are you? One considers her timing, of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down. Suggestive, even borderline suspicious, but hardly conclusive.

In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz. G'day.

I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line. Ball's in your court, Mr. McCloy. In downtown Sydney for a start. An outbreak of <i>Chimera.</i> Good. Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof. Oh, Hunt, please! One can't hold Nyah responsible for her actions.. She wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, Hunt. from this moment you're responsible for what happens to her, and if you're looking out for her well-being, I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me. Ball's in your court, Hunt. What've you got to say? Nyah's waiting for your answer. Somebody's been slipping you our mail. Come on out here, you bad girl. Why, you going to make me a better offer? Yep. You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer. I knew where it was. You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you. Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes. And you're happy about that? If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security. Nyah! Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options. We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options. Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share. We'll agree to buy at fifty. -- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are.. In any case we don't want your cash. Not exactly. Wallis? It's that time. Go.In other words, you're calling her a flake. She doesn't belong here, Sean. Let her go. Than thirty-seven million pounds? Not really. What was the top bid? There it is, guys, the last of it. Oh. then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish, doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective. You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for. I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint. Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off. You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was. Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you. Fight a bit of a cold.. Not going in from the ground. Show me the atrium. Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed. Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes, Nyah will kill herself. So, first things, first. Swanbeck said there's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts. Wrong. All we've got to worry about is Ambrose. Nyah will take care of Nyah. I'll be damned. It's McCloy, the Biocyte CEO. Not at all. But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site? ..or hard wired.. A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance? It's okay. She scrambled the transmission. Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position. No... No. Should I? No. No. - you who don't have a conscience. What did you think you were doing! No time to explain. You've done well, and we're so close. So close. It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks. Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go! Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose.. It's going to be okay. Are you okay? Easy, easy, easy, shhh! He's touched your heart. You're overwhelmed. You need to think it over. You'll meet him somewhere in a month. If You're not out in 48 hours I'm coming in and getting you out. Give me the ear piece. I want you out of Australia! ..I don't know how much more plainly I can put it. Nyah, you've done more than enough. Even the best of snake charmers get bit. I want <i>you out of there.</i> You noticed. What're you going to do? Spank me? Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this? Affirmative. Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money -- I've no doubt. Have you met them? We know him. He's over your left shoulder, looking right at you as you go on.. Just like old times? How's it going? Everything okay? Well, forewarned is forearmed. And while we're at it, be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose's plans, especially any involving you.. You'll be fine. I'm going to lose you. He's got you on Qantas flight 2735. It's going to be delayed. You don't trust me. Before you are. Well, I mean it's not a total loss. It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.. Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. What wouldn't make him suspicious? Then feel better!.. Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this? Can you think of a better one? Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands. I don't. You can be a thief and have a conscience. Something like that. So would I. But it's not mine to give. Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life. This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah. Sean Ambrose, for one. And six billion in the world. Five, six-hundred thousand. Damn, you're beautiful. Of what? So do I. Sort of. I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes. So where did I got right? Which is? Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar. They've got a book for everything. Oh. Well..this isn't exactly by the book. Care to wait a decent interval? Ethan Hunt. Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority. I can make them go away. I need your help and I thin you can use mine. Pull over and listen to me, will you? Just listen.. Hi. Would you mind slowing down? Not really. I triggered the alarm.. You didn't do that badly. Working under adverse conditions. Highly adverse conditions. Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together. At least you walked. Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer. we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow. Shall we? Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load. How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall? I wouldn't do that. Hey, you put me here. I just do what I'm told. - torque wrench. Far right. Oh, either way works for me. Think you're the only one who can pick a lock? Uh-huh? What if I pay the rent? There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad. Oh. Well. I think that can be arranged. No. You just looked as if you did. Do you know me? Not sure. Some sort of vacation. I'll let you know where I'm going. I don't. No exactly. I do. No, I don't. But in this case - By fire. That's the best way, really. Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera. Yes. Yes, I gathered as much. I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment. You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing. Aren't you even curious? About why she did it? She sacrificed herself.. You mean that leaves Miss Hall. Yes, I believe that's right. We think we've got our finger on the buyer. Not yet. We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage. Very. I don't think I can get her to do it. She's got no training for this kind of thing. You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief. And then what? Excuse me? If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane. Locating him in time to stop something like that - 'Terrorists?' In order to do that, I've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it. Right now only Ambrose knows that. Sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground. Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it. So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't. You know we had reservations about each other. Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that? Twice. If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight? Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. So let's get on with it. He's still in Sydney? An idea, yeah. You gotta be kidding. Like what? Well. You're sorry and I'm sorry. Sorry I didn't let you know where I was. ..I'm fine..and you? You keep calling me Dmitri. You really shouldn't. ..not in time to save him. He was quite a man. Did he know before the end you two had succeeded? Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances. They're ready and waiting. You'll soon be with old friends. You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor.. Good job. And thanks. Copy. She's only got twenty-eight minutes left. Track ahead and pick her up. Luther, say again. Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds. Luther, I'm looking at security. I'm not waiting 48 hours. When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out. Now how to get in there. Let's start from the inside out. Nyah still on the property? I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease. Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus. I told her to get outta there. I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic. Get me a twenty on Nyah. Nyah, Ambrose is heading back. There's an enveloped inside -- Confirm. Left jacket pocket. Left jacket pocket? Yep. Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims. Why not? Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules. In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world. I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon. Put in the coordinates and let's get a visual. The visuals aren't coming up.And the check's in the mall. We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds.. Range is two kay. Not for seven more minutes. Right. ..in the building... Billy. I think we got a problem. Nyah's on the wing. Up early. Billy, do you copy? I'm not ready! So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy's got Chimera. What manic invents disease like that in the first place? Why would he do it? It is, Billy. Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one. He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab. Five and a half minutes. He's breached the hot zone.. She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan. I am. She is. I'm booted up. Go, Ethan. So what did he say? She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs. One klick away. Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running! How much time does she have left? Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion. Alarm in cosmetics. Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop. No garage entrance. Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol. All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building. Sorry, that it a Biocyte facility, their storage structure.. You've got the voice print, I'll get us in.. Yeah. Why else would he come back to Australia? If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere. She must still be on the property. Left jacket pocket confirmed. Roger that. Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket... Nekhorvich's boss? Right. I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer. That simple, huh? The satellite doesn't work as fast as I do. It's the transponder.Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did. Well, Hunt, what are your plans? Where is she now, by the way? Do you know? In this case, it wasn't a bad idea. In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it. And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged. I'm assuming you approve. But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus. I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed. And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon. And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose. Of course it was. Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there. You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days. At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face. Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus. Not even antibodies. Why not? You've done just about everything else on this operation. Sorry, Ethan. I don't quite know where to begin. Any suggestions? No. I can't afford to be curious. And neither can you, Hunt.. Something else? Brave girl. If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit, you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice. But in either case you've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her. After that it's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law. And Hunt. However you obtain it, we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera. Bring it back alive. - good. Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got - - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth. Yes, I believe that's right. Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious. But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera. Do you? Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem. You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte. If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market. We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable. No deposits, no withdrawals. Therefore no suspects. Well it's not mission <i>difficult,</i> Hunt. It's mission <i>impossible.</i> Difficult should be a walk in the park for you. If you can think of a quicker way to get to Ambrose, you're welcome to try. Oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job. You mean it'll be difficult. Go to bed with a man and lie to him? She's a woman. She's got all the training she needs. Well, then I mislead you. Or you made the wrong assumption. Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done. Then makes sure she continues to see him. Gets him confide in her and report to you. Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously. She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since. We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him. - is where Miss Hall comes in. Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business. - right. In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts. In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us. The question is why? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying? Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers? Then you do think it was Ambrose. Not necessarily. What did you think of him? When I couldn't find you, I had to replace you. Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice. He double you, what? Two, three times? You were there. Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead. So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier. We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.. Like? 'You're sorry and I'm sorry.' Why did you phrase it like that? Don't be. Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh? -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we are disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her. -- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us -- No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get -- I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here. Hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog? We aren't completely stupid. So you noticed too? You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die. He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you? 79 kilos. What the hell's it matter? Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE? Smoke screen for what? Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there? Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind, I pray you go insane. 'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it. My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord. So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business. Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact. Not a problem unless you're gonna make -- You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what? I never said I was. I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat. He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid. -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we know we're ready to launch. May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he stops believin' -- That's what I said. He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry. Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down. We're not sure when it happens, so let's not -- Let's wait on the power cells. Wha'? Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all -- Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on -- 25 kilos each, huh? How many? Little ratty-ass. You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another. Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid. I don't. But that ground looked none too stable, and I don't want anyone -- Well, don't ask me to. I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into -- I know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to -- I assume he licked it clean. Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut. ...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie.... Like my pistola. Sorry. Thought I heard something. Shut up. Thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So I left the bottle out as bait. Didn't bite. Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought. You see anybody else here? Just between you and me. Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn. What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch? So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship. Probably right. Tell me it's not a mirage. Which means he went toward sunrise. A very good sign. That's Riddick's direction. You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy. Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep. Only around humans. Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on -- Big Evil? Amazing. I'm Johns. Hey, who? Listen to her? Her ? When she was willing to sacrifice us all? He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look! Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this. Those suns gotta come back sometime . And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then. We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now.... I'm born-again. For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you? She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells. Very big beads. Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really. Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up. What the hell are these? A toast to whatever he just said. King Tut's tomb.... ...then we saw this. Like who, Mr. Chrislam? Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples. What's one more to you? Like this is the one that sends you to Hell? Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv. What do you care? Don' look, don' look, don' look.... Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent. Trawl with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us. Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto. Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay? What if you're one of five? Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right? Ain't all of us gonna make it. Aw, this can't be happening to me.... What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut. About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick! Such as. Well, what's it look like now? Fuck me . You said "clear." I'm willing to take a cut in pay. Wanna rag your fat mouth? I'd rather piss glass. Are you fuckin' kidding me? If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not? Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way. Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me. Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock.... Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't. We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if I shouldn't lighten the load right now.Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing.... Probably okay to talk to me now. Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this? It's a fucking staircase! Go over it! GO OVER IT! He died fast. And if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out. Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare. Don't wanna miss this. You barely know them. You'd die for them? No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn. Just give me your hand. Here. Make it easy on you. Step aboard, Carolyn. 'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that. They're already dead. Get on board. Got a better idea. Come with me . Truthfully? I wouldn't know how. Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was his monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see. Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck. Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman. We can't make it. So where the hell's God now, huh? I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME! As fast as you can. As fast as you can. Let's drop back an' boot up. One or two. So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? Until you can't see what's eating you? That the big plan? Back to the ship, huh? What it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. With her bleeding. Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think. Listen . Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger. Saw something I didn't like. Actually... That's what I been askin' myself. Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there. Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better. Had it with deals. Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive. Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed. I asked what you thought. An' now you're worried about a repeat of history? Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape. Power cells. Look deeper. Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? Slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. Maybe I did do a few people. But not this one. No ma'am, not this time. Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor." All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now. The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight. 'Mean the whispers? Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types? KEEP GOING OR I WILL! Get the girl back under. Keep going. Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a spare. 'Cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker. You don't see. And pointless. What're you doin'? Which half? There is no "safe." Has anyone checked the coring room? Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum. Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you. What, you 'spect me to do it? What's her name, anyway? So which one caught your eye? Nice embellishment. Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum. Kept calling it "murder" when I did it. Not if I'm the one. Just realized that, huh? They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood. No. She's not. About the girl. Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you? Looks clear. Said "looks clear." How 'bout a cut in your gut? Think about that reward, Johns. Well, you got the big gauge. Not afraid of the dark, are you? My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you. You'd cut me loose, Boss? For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell? Say that again. Found somethin' worse than me, huh? What, it's broken? Just wanted his O-2. Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead. I know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency. What, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls? Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up. Right?Mia...? Excuse me??? You did miss -- You did. Dad... You taking any medication? Why? Then you get it. You'll understand. Wait. I want to tell you something. That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together -- A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so -- Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier... That's what it asked me. "What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment. God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia. How? Nothing is real until it's perceived. A quantum one. Could be. At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways. It's an experiment. That's the physicist's playground. Where to? I could go out of town. Okay. Could we go somewhere? I've been dreaming about you.And what made you think it was Sidney? No. Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number? The killer called her. There's someone here who wants to help. Detective Kincaid? Is that a threat? Is that a threat, Detective? Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen. What does this have to do with Sid? What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too. I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it. Understood. If you'll excuse me Detective. Gale. Yeah. A real tragedy. Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman. Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that. Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale! Where's Gale? I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me! Sid I can see you! Help me Sid! The killer's got me! Don't worry, I've got a permit for it. Do you want me to come with you Sid? I mean, remember what Randy said? No. Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro. Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night. I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know, trick you out of hiding. Follow me. What? What are you doing here? I told you to stay hidden! It's not safe for you up here. Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing. Who is it? Nevermind, what'd you two find? Do you want us to come with you? Just Jennifer. And you. Oh. Yeah, I guess I do. Sid, this is detective Kincaid. GALE BEHIND YOU! OH. OH GOD. GALE -- Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything. Gale, your engine's still running. You're not a detective. Stop following me. I'm on duty. Jennifer needs me. I've got my suspicions but still, nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person. What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand? I already removed it. I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything. The boys said no. She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked. Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'. She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research. Off the record. Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you. You used to say that was our strength. What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her! So it's off to London for a week? New York for a month? L.A Forever? What about me? Why would the police come to you? Do you really mean it this time Gale? You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale. They found another note? What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale. But you know who she was. No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call. So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.To see your reaction. Closer than you think. Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly. No! You listen to me, if you're not where I want you in fifteen minutes I'll hollow her out. Do you understand? You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live? Good bye Ben. That's right. And you beat ROUND 1. Now we're taking the game to a whole new level. Meet me beneath the Hollywood sign in ten minutes. I'll have your girlfriend. We'll be waiting. Very good. Now we play ROUND 2. Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2? You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies. More of a game really. I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there. She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start. I've got my knife. Now let's see you act your way out of this one. Really? You're such a talented actor. You almost sound like that guy from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT CARRIE. Ben. Ben Damon. But your voice sounds so familiar. Wait, wait. Don't hang up. Do I? I don't know. Who is this? Hello. It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later. You're doing real good. Can't you figure it out? I wanna finish this where it all began. Woodsboro. You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there. I'll call you, when you're on your way. She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together. I don't want them, I want you! It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die! Are real? How do you know you're not hearing things? How do you know I'm not someone in your head? Somewhere, you know. Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you. Go there. Don't do it! If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone? The question isn't who I am. The question is, who's with me. { a click } I only her you too, Sidney. Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon. No. We play in my court this time. Come to Hollywood. STAB 3's going to cutting corners cast-wise. And I've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named Dewey Rielly. Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT. Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott. I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game. Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?For God's sake, what happened to me? How did you get me out of there? I have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... A real dirty... big city. What do you think? You know, Tommi wants me to become the man I used to be. It's important - he knows the last chapter. I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go. Oh, Ellen. My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew. Of course you'll give me the blame again. Like back then. Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen? You know what I have to do now, and believe me: I don't enjoy doing this. It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way. Will you finally cut it out? Just in case you haven't noticed, I am trying to write a book here. And maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. So why can't you just leave me alone? Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors. "There is something negative about the place..." What the hell are you trying to say? Come on! Spit it out! During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner. What's your point? Hi, darling. Maybe an animal. She was old. What? Who's that? What? What am I supposed to sense? Ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway? That we've created ourselves a ghost? Come on! Where have you been? Oh, baloney. You should just hear yourself talk! Where have you been all day? Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus? No, thanks. I have everything I need. Drive safely, you hear? So, did you sleep good? Come on, at least try one. It took me two hours to make these. Come on, this isn't about honesty. You just need a good night's sleep. The way you toss and turn all night, even I hardly get any sleep. You know, it's not always easy for me, either. But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis. Who was that? Maybe different. I don't know, Ellen. So do I, believe me. And two months later, we got married. And all because of one sentence: "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..." Not a book fair. I was signing autographs in a department store. What? We just have to make a new beginning. Hey, take your time. You know time heals better than any shrink ever can. Is everything alright? Aren't you feeling well? Making our very own solstice fire. Where are you going? Hey, flower child, the sixties are over. And this stuff is hazardous to your health. My father was an electrician. Already forgot that? I'll do it myself. Are you crazy? That costs a fortune! Look at this! We'll have to fix the whole wiring. This stuff is dangerous as hell. In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it. Oh, damnit! We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box! Oh, that was upstairs. A real antiquity! I think it's great. It still worked in town. Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences. You know how it is with women. They say it's fantastic. At least that's what I read in a men's magazine. So who are the two lucky ones? You'll never get away from me! Ellen, move aside... What else should I do, damn it, he's dying! I have to cut his windpipe... "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..." Why else? Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here. Twenty-three, to be exact. Look at this. The lock is totally demolished. Tenth floor. Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".That Could Be. You know who the father is...? Hey, Tommy. Heard your wife's having a baby. Nothing happened. I know my lines... What'll I do for fun? I never touched her. My mother's gr... ...I was just talking to that girl in the other room. She wasn't in the... Uh, look .... Sister, I've just come from a fire ... Mornin, sister. That makes a lot of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't coming to see your breasts. They are coming to see you act . What are you doing this evening...? Isn't he... How'd you like working with Richard Hill? I saw Desert Sun, I wanna tell you... I swear that that woman in my room... You got to get out of here... Are you all right...? ...wouldn't that be dangerous? Nice town that you've got here. Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this. How old are you? What do you drink? Well, I can offer you something to drink? Well, I'm pretty impolite. Would you like some? But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat. Way of the world. I just don't know what order they come in... I'm ready! How could she turn on me like that? I thought she liked me. You mind...? I've always seen that. Just him and me. No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe... Everybody needs a hob... Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a schoolnight , something... Everybody needs a hobby. Okay, look Page... No, you're absolutely r... Alright. Let's... Page five, the fucking horse dies. You know, she could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, wife ...? It could be his... You don't need "Hi I've just come from the restaurant." What I... She's a waitress . You look at: girl comes in the room, an apron , a brown bag , what is she...? She's a... Tell it with pictures. What I'm saying... Tell it with... The people came to see a motion Picture . ...hold on... I mean, okay, fine, but it's a motion Picture . Page... three . Now: "It's a nice evening." I'm not gonna say that... "It's a nice..."Why, you whore ! No. Don't tell me that. Who is this person that you've found? Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us? Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...? What did you say...? Oh. What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian... Well, I know , because they told me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole town has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a date , they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night. It isn't... Where have you been, we had a date for three ...where have you been ...? Where have you been... We had a date. Sure, but...ten thousand dollars. Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty million dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl... I beg your pardon? Ten thousand dollars. Look at this. Do you know what they're offering? Look at this. They treat us like we're their backyard. Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street? What, what what are you doing here? Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some News for You ... That's right... And I might have something important to tell you... Go you Huskies... Drama Group? We on for tomorrow night? Waal, that's what I'm saying. Annie: you stick to the Amateur Theatricals. This isn't quite the same thing, you see? This is Big Business, in which, our Life... ...s'no less a commodity than...than our... What I am saying , is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now: they want to close down Main Street... ...I'm sure that people are upset... Morning. I'm glad you asked...I'll tell you what was wrong with it. And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now: You want to bring business into this town? You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist. Not at the moment, no ... You said three ...? Who got their heads cut? Kiss my ass. Now: the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council... I want you to hear this, pal... Forget the overages, forget Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks. You know what it would cost for them to build this set? Two Million Dollars! Now: I have to talk to you. Fuck the traffic light. I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture... Main Street. And what was it you wanted to say? What's in the case? ...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could possibly make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath. I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me. Okay... Oh, you're his attorney, too...? He didn't have to tell... And I've got a witness! Your Mr. White saw the crime. Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion... Well you guess what. The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of... She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night. And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so... This young woman. Arrest him. Arrest him. He saw the girl in the car... He saw the accident...? Who's White...? What? You know, the rape, to...even to the accident... I had a witness I would. Half a buck I'd put him in jail... Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls... Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt... Yes. No. No, but we're planning to. How about that. What the hell are you so down about?If I go to jail...? I'm going to tell the truth. I...I think that's right... They'll...they'll blackball me... But it'll stop the movie. I can't do that. If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career... What am I gonna do? I saw... That's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers. Both up with the chickens. Well ain't you amazing. Well, I could get a rolltop desk. To print the newspaper. And I'd come to write . To write. To write. Right here in the office. And come to the printshop. You know why ...? ...and we could get up every morning... We could live up here, live up in the country. I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here... Yeah, you? Good morning. Pelting down out there. You know what else a man can do? You'd do the newspaper right here. It does? What would you do with it, the printshop... Gosh, you look nice. I'd love to. Is it... No. You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words. And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know. They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...? ...how else can you talk?

Please ... They meet on Main Street. Her horse has just died. He's coming from the fire. It used to be the Old Mill. I can't get it to come out right. Yes. Why? You used to go out with him, you broke up with him? Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd? But it's absurd. You believe that? Because I'd met someone else. You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance? Later on. Start? This isn't a good time. Why? Oh. "To the love of my life, Love, Doug"? Thank you. Hi. One moment. I don't drink. Oh, God... Would you put on your cl... Just leave it outside. Would you go in... Great. Who is it...? Gonna' be good as new. Fix my glasses. Me, too. You have a paperclip? You like kids? You got a paperclip?

What are you doing tonight? No, I don't... How ...? I... ...the, the, the symbol of the fire... About conflict ... What I need to say ... But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill? I can ? How can you say that? In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving them a second chance, or they're giving it to me. That's the truth. The truth's best, don't you think? I...I decided to give it another chhh... They decided, I decided to, to...You love what? Hi. Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station. It was lovely meeting... ...that. Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple things, that... ...such a pleasant sound. ...that's what the swing is there for...thats its purpose , isn't it... I don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might... Really. With the porch swing and everything... For example, he's just come back from a fire and he...um... That's a fine house. You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there. The, the, the, the sanctity of everyday things... No, no. Of course, that's exactly what it represents... Goodbye. And likewise. And you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech. Just you. ...that it has been vouchsafed to him. Of course, of course that's what I'm saying . As the Old Mill goes around, he sees ... ...that...he sees that... Of mercy ...off... That: in an act of... But, but but but... That, he says, there are no second chances...that he's been presented what he prayed for...and: he's ruined it. ...that...that he prayed for a second chance. But...do you see? That's true. You grow up here? But why the dalmation? Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse? It's... I... It's about a man who gets a second chance. Could you tell me when's the next train? Why? You like my play. That's good. That's really good. You have a gift for words. I just got kicked off my first movie. Actually, I'm not sure if I quit. I think that I got fired. I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth. I quit the movie. I quit. So young, so unlined, so full of promise. So innocent. "Anguish." You haven't heard of it. Other one has history, too. I wrote my play on it. Well, it had sentimental value. The people in New Hampshire. I have one, but they lost it. I want to rent this one. I need a typewritter. ...small town. I suppose. You have to make your own fun. You're doing a Play ... Well, where do they hold court? What? Courthouse back in town. They know what her tits look like. What's an Associate Producer credit? Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire? Can't...can't you build the Old Mill? Hi. I told her Thank You Very Much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because... She came in here, wait, she...I was giving her a massage...wait...Wait! She came in here...she... ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in bed , I told her I could not--we don't know each other, you see... Will you help me out...? That's my... You have to hide. Look, look there's someone else... But not that way ... Look, look, I like you very much ... Look. Why? I, actually yes. She's absolutely r... ...I just swore my life away, back in that... Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...? I perjured myself. I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did... I don't suppose you could help me with that , could you? Turn back the clock , or something? Give me back my, give me back my purity , I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...? But what is truth? Eh? In't that the thing? What is true? I, uh...I'm leaving. For what cause? So be it. The girl was in the car. I have to tell the truth. It's not you , it's... The girl was in the car. I'm out. You want me to lie. I've got a date. I'm gonna nail it. The movie's about purity . So we don't show her breasts. We show them to him , her back to the camera. I hurt my finger. I can't. What's the... I don't drink. Um, no. And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I... I want to make a good film. It's about a man who gets a second chance. I grew up on your mov... That's a real fault , I... Well, you know, you know, that's a lie, I, I... I can only write on a manual. I can't write it. I lost my typewriter. You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...

I don't got the money. Eight hundred grand to show her tits... That's why I want it. Type it up and get it back to me in... Later for that, Walt, let's get this: we need the "pages" for the new "Old Mill"...alright? We need a new title, we need a... How are you getting on with these fine people? Stop ... 55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a product placement... My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself. They're coming Fedex...

Of course he's on the coast, where's he gonna be, the Hague ... Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece. Get him a half of a 28-year old girl. Now: I'm looking at the... Because, because...we don't have to build an Old Mill -- they have an Old Mill -- yeah . It's on a stream -- that's where you put a mill. Waterford, Vermont. Where is it? That's where it is... ...you got to get me that street for nothing... What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill... I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding ... You told me that about the last town. Town in New Hampshire was small town America too. Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street. And then they kicked us out... You do...? Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece? If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape. How long since you almost went to jail for this shit? We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...? We don't show her breasts, we just show your reaction ... So you see what I'm saying ...the movie is about purity ... Joe, the writer? Bobby ... Are you Okay? And you go start with that stuff in this town... Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you? You can go... Hold on: what Bob is saying, you don't need... What... She's a... We've got three days to... Tell it with pictures . He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby? Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip. What else? What's his name? Izzat so? Aren't you ever in school? Scene twelve ...arrival at the mill. I've got scene twelve ... Shouldn't you be in school...? Marty... Well, Joe said it, and he's right. ...he's right here, Mr. Mayor... Claire: As an interpretive artist to a creative artist: Stay with me. I need you. We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us . Stay. Stay. Tonight...when... When they've gone. Let's talk. Let's really talk. We could, we'll have dinner , we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll... ...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her. Please don't go. Please don't go. What can I do but beseech you...? Trauma, toil ...when are we free of them...? When...? ...yes... I know... I know what you are, I am so sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part. An artist of your caliber... I, uh... I've always thought so... Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form. I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting... Bill: get a copy of that letter...! I just wanted to tell you that I am past chagrined, I'm mortified at the way you were spoken to... Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire! ...and my heart goes out to you, because I know... And you know what...? ...wants a piece... I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants... I know, I know. No, she didn't Claire. But I think you should do the scene. ...I know...I know... Because he understood. That was her life's blood on the stage. Nothing. He held her and he wept. Because he... Listen to me: Elanora Duse was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket. She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for." She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week. I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week." The greatest actress of her time. You know what her Producer said? Who are these from? Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being. Now, look. Claire: Listen to me. I want to tell you a story. ... no , they don't... I know that, Claire. I, we all know... I know that... Forget the contract. Claire. What is it? You can't do what? What...? Yeah. Joe? Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been... Yes, yes, but... Yeah. Yes, but, Joe, Joe's been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about... This is Joe White. No, no...Please. We're just talking about the... Claire, Bob Bar... Claire, when did you... Put something in his room. What does he like? That's cor... Somebody make a note. I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like? Lilacs. Okay. A truck of lilacs when the broad comes. And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...? "Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from. Marty. P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..." Her religion bars her from fulfilling her contr... She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil? Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad. Why not? Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court. Did she like the costumes? Did she throw up? You show Claire these sketches? You what...? Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that personal business ? Ah, Christ. Marty ...Are we paying you? Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us? Where's my schedule? Where are we booked tonight? Did you, where are we going tonight...? Oh, that's great . Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world. Not now. ...totally false... totally false. He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever... ...the finest people you could ever hope to work with... You have the new Old Mill pages? You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him? We're very upset with her. Get someone to double for her , her tits, the tits scene, call L.A. I want to see some pictures of the women's tits . Of their tits . Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up... That, that's your life's blood on the st... You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them. Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from Marty . What's her problem? You told me they had an Old Mill here.. I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we... Wait a sec, Marty. Call us back. Two minutes. I don't need a cause, just a lawyer. And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars. Then you're finished in show business. ...that's just so narrow ... No, what is it? I treated you like a son or nephew. I don't getcha. Thank God, it's up to you, Pal. Sup to you... To the contrary. I want you to tell the truth. The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing. You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on. And you have a fertile imagination. Imagination wants to fill in the blanks. Now. If you aren't sure , then they have nothing. Bob walks free. As he should. Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart. You know? The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us. Because we tell the truth. About our lives. Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself. If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...? To our world. Cause you are a part of that world, now. You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex. And be part of your world. I got a five picture deal with the studio. And you stick with me. You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll direct the third one. You are a part of this world. It's in your blood. It's you. You have to do the right thing: we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, literally is at our door. You have to stand with the troops, Joe. That's the bottom line. You have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself. The girl wasn't in the car. Let's speak English. You've got to help the side. He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...? Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...! I know you are. Go you Huskies. Know? They could draw them from memory. You're fantastic. What a find you are. Get outta here. We need the Dead Horse Scene. ...she keeps her back to the camera...? Get a typist. Gettim a typist. Get outta here. Why? Why? Where have you been...? Did my matzohs come? Get some for everybody. Thank you. Lemme tell you about my first movie... Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some nosh ...what do you like to drink...? Hey, it's with the Gods. We don't have the money, we have to write it out. The best or not. And that's a lesson. You get your typewriter yet...? I know you do. Then, you write that. And then this is our second chance. That's why we're here... Hey, Joe...Good. You know B... Grace. Get Mr. White a manual typewriter. It's not a lie, it's a gift for fiction. And somebody find me my lucky pillow. Grace... I know the feeling. Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter. Halo? Marty ? What would they have used instead of an old mill? We need it tonight. Marty? Yeah you were saying...? We're out of money. We can't shoot the Old Mill. Does it have to be an Old Mill? Where have you been? Do something. Yes? Hello, Mr. Mayor. Nothing, just an, an unfortunate... It's the Mayor, he's saying... That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good. Look, Carla. This is a hard time for you. Many young people go to Hollywood. I did...And we all dream of it, and here, here Hollywood has come to you... Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can get away , something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food. You want... No, just the...there's no witnesses, right...? She wasn't in...you were al... He's got a gift for fiction. Is that one hell of a kid? NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF. DID YOU HEAR ME? I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that? IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, BAZOOMER - COM ? Find it. Pay her off. Well, I've enjoyed it, too. Any... any... any time... What does the woman want from life...? No no no no no no no no no find me the money... Find the money. Pay her. It's just a formality. Marty... Like dykes and dogs. That's what I said. I'm gonna' bring it off. What's in all the bags? Did you bring Bob's weights? How was your flight? Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates... I left that for you. So we just got lucky. George, that is so kind of you. ...it is? ...the city council... ...we need the shooting permit for Main Street... That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to bother you with... Why would they be illegal? My golly, you know? All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar? I have to tell you, I can not express to you how happy ... I don't care. Fix it. No you can't lose the shot. The meaning of the film is in that shot. Why? We need a new name for the movie. Where's the writer? ...we can't lose the wind... Givvem a cigarette...No problem. I got it. I don't know. I think it does. You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it. What happened to Stargher. That last time. He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work. All yours. My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had. So you say. Well look at that. Yep. Eloped. You sure about this? That went well. COME ON! Where the hell are we? Little boy?! That's him! Like hell "wait." Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one. Nothing else matters. Find out where she is. Yes. I am. A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's. And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing. What difference does it make...? Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time. Evil. It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse." Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy? This is Stargher we're talking about? You think you can do this, don't you? What about Julia? I did, yeah. You're the shrink, you tell me. What did you see? That's what therapists are for, right? Absolutely. I suppose everyone does. Peter, okay? Ah, the part of us that can't be explained. What then? I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years. Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster. Isn't that something? I don't know what name scientists have for something like that... No. Not at all. From what I understand, he knows I"m here, isn't that right? Edward Baines, I presume. Hi, Ed. I'm Pete. I know him. This man is deeply disturbed, he... How hard could it be...? I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with. Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure. They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why. Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully. It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean. But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but Listen, he wasn't just careless. It went beyond that... There's always a chance they'll confess. As far as I needed. You're kidding me. Delano? That hoist, with the winch... I need you to find something in the basement... Just graduated law school. Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter. What about the cat? How's the patient. Federal Bureau of Investigation, ma'am. We know all, see all... Thanks you. Six weeks off does a body good. I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward. Dr. Kent. Is she alright? I am. I'm a pretty boring guy. No. No. Prevacid. For my stomach. Absolutely. No. Into Stargher. Inside... When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out. I'll get her... Stargher is in custody. The functional equivalent of being under arrest. Normally, we'd Mirandize him, and if he didn't lawyer up, we'd interrogate him. But because of his condition, he doesn't have the capacity to waive those rights. Sometime yesterday morning. It's his dog. The dog's an albino. He'd love an animal like that. Now. I need it. Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog. Grandparents. Live over in Davis. I saw her. Julia. Alive. I saw everything. Considering where I've been... But you looked so cute. All sleepy... Right here. Tell you what. If this thing burns us, I take that heat. I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea." I don't have to. What else do we do?! They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon. Four-oh. He got Julia at seven-thirty last night. You know what time it is now...?! No. Can you get a man close? We proceed assuming she is. After three years she remembers what the guy drove? Nicole Labetzki. Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked. Here he is. How is she?Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise. Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say? You. You're the guy that lent me the money. Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you. If you could see your way to lending me some cash - I'll share something with you. Just five dollars, please. I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad. Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe. Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out. I'm Daffy. Excuse me.Thanks. Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet - Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep. Just take it, OK. Here. I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money. I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it. I'm sorry, I don't think so. Help you out? Richard. Hi. Yes? I wouldn't know anything about that, sir. I don't think so. Traveler. Fuck off. Was there a shark? Did you see a shark? What happened? A bit fucking late. Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it. Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it. Big? A shark fin? What! I think we're about half way. Everyone ok? I have no idea but it looks like a long way. We think in miles, not kilometers. I don't know - I'm American. Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone. We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then? Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going? Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is? That's the wrong one. Nice work. It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to. Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did. The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday. Bonjour. If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don�t try then we'll never know. Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well. Exactly. There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen. You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself. I think so too. Francoise - No. Swim? So from there to there? Hi there. Here, take a look. Not too bad. Eh - bonsoir. Uh-huh. So? Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth. Where did you lose it?It's the same. What happened to what they gave you? What are you thinking, calling me at home with a message like that? You've compromised me and our relationship -- I can't do that. Helena -- Helena, please. This is out of your hands. Have you gone crazy? You are not Carl. You aren't as good as Carl. They are moving the trial to a high security location. The press has gone berserk. The jury will be influenced. Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case. That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid. I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed. Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business. Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who they are. That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them. They don't know Ruiz. Church and State. Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl. Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money. This place is swept twice a day. I learned that in Miami in '85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing. I suspect he'll accept his payment in publicity. You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl. We get Adler and we beat this thing. Of course he is. I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk... That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children. I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here. I want you to go home and relax the best you can. Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important. Got it? Good. Do not discuss anything over the telephone. Do not talk to the neighbors. Stay out of your yard. Good. From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it? Listen to me carefully. First of all, Carl isn't here. DEA's got him and they'll hang on to him until arraignment, which will probably be tomorrow. So here you're wasting your time. Are you with me? I understand. You're upset. You want to know what's going on. That's good. Helena, I'm so sorry -- Carl -- Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed. I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal. Carl, that's insane. I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it. It could have been frozen along with everything else. I was just waiting for the right time. What? Carl, I'm running late. I'm coming right now --Yeah, like turning into a beautiful woman. Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months? She's your girlfriend. Open it, talk about your kids. I don't know. I love my job. I love it. The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it. Winners don't do coke. Or haven't you been reading the bumper stickers? Maradona is a cokehead. Hand of God, my ass. We're wasting our time here. You want to make a wager on this? She knows Arnie Metzger. I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people. They're whispering. I can't hear them, but I know it. I smell conspiracy. I feel the lie vibrating out of the home. Who do you work for? Move 'em to Texas, fry 'em up. It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick. Why do women wear makeup and perfume? No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh? No telltales. Nothing to read. Not touching my face. Not even blinking. No giveaways. How're you feeling?Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life. Why don't you develop a useful skill? What do you think she wants? What do we do? Are you getting this on tape? He won. He was a winner. That bothers you. You should see little Montel play. Little Montel is the next Maradona. So does half of San Diego. I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit. She ain't in on it. That's a big word for a fisherman. We got you on tape making the deal. We got you bragging about the quality. We got you bragging about your business. We got you. Chill out -- Nope. I feel good. So go shower already. You're breaking my heart. That thought makes me feel awful. When the DEA gets into the narcotics business, then we'll stay at the Four Seasons. He hired you. That was a mistake. This attitude's not gonna help him any, is it? So you pay off our customs officials? We can protect you. One chance here, Eduardo. Make us believe you got a boss. No boss, it's all on you. The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states. Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon. You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo? You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time. Nobody said shit, Eduardo --No, of course not. She's one of the top students at her school. I... I don't really know. I don't know what you mean. Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally. I appreciate you coming in so early. She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour. So's the video camera. God, I don't get it. Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child? Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen? About the other night, I'm sorry. No, not yet. Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death. I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day. That's different. Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too. Look, I'm as worried as you are -- The first thing we have to do is present a unified front. Barbara -- I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar. It's this General, Salazar. At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to. Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me. As a parent. How long have you known? Space for what? To O.D. like that other kid? I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents. Because it isn't. Correct? To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old. This is different. Stop. You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that. We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit. School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly. Christ, this could be embarrassing. I think she's lying. That's frustrating. Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed. Oh, yes I can. What is wrong with you? What? You're going away. You're getting help somewhere. Okay, young lady, that's it. Where is it? Where are the drugs? Where are they? It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired. I don't know. As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time". Somehow, I don't see that happening. Fine -- legalization. Okay, forgetting all of our international trade agreements, legalize everything today. The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions. The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy. Our borders are mobbed, lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke, snort and shoot themselves into oblivion. What's it like? Imagine you're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta, except the beggars are wearing $1500 suits and they don't say "please" or "thank you." Medicinal marijuana initiative. Or am I being cynical? Depends on the state. You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff. Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me. Definitely third category. Depends who it's from. Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels? That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power? Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence? So what's it doing in Tijuana? The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso? If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments. Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country. Noriega is a criminal. Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians. Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities? That triple the amount of stuff is going through. Any way we can do it better? What do you look for? Any idea how much? Just tell me where she is. I'll pay you a thousand dollars. I have it in my wallet. I have money -- I need to find my daughter. I'll pay you. I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here. I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place. You want to help? Stay the fuck away from her. You don't know what the hell you're talking about. You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away. And neither does she. What? I don't give a fuck about your parents -- I'm not the police. I don't care about experimentation. She's a kid. I'm worried to death. Can you tell me anything? Do you have any ideas? She hasn't called you? She snuck away. And we haven't seen her. She hasn't come home. Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand? What is your policy for treating addiction? Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem. You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel. I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels. I'll get there as soon as I can. What? I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified. Hello. Like you protected Landry? I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side? Who do we interface with on their side? He died in a liposuction surgery, right? Who are these guys?I have a lock on the door. I'll keep it in my office room. What did I say? Four. My son Jeb. It's a gift for him. Wrap it up.Yes. Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? Wow. Oh. Is Noel in? I don't know Megan. I had a nightmare one night and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it was okay. I think that was the first time. Does that count? What about the game? I'm not sure. Soft and Wet. That's very interesting. What was that? My turn. What's your favorite song? As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood? ...I think rust. Jeremy what the hell are you doing? Jesus. out again? Would you like to try going-- He's dealing with a lot of things. I think he needs to find answers himself. What do I do when I'm around someone I know? ...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of? I remember you. Yeah? Megan where are you calling from? Megan? Oh. Oh shit... When was the last time I wore pink? No that's it. Yes. That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick? Do you remember me getting sick? I haven't been sick this year. I know that. He's asleep. I know. I'm still going to New York. Just not this second. I don't think I got the job in New York. No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me. Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do. You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it. Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right. I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color. Quick. I have to go now. The guy might not have been carrying anything. Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore. Listen. I got to be on the sidelines during the game... You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-- I don't know what you're asking? Yes. Like what? I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. Like on t.v. I thought he was carrying something. Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show. I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on. That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. If he's carrying, he'll step out of line. Just give me a minute. Are you for real? We're not proceeding anywhere together. What do you want? It's for last week's game. I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.' What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment? At the church... You were following me weren't you? What was your idea Elijah? You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step. What is over? You assumed wrong. In college. A car accident. Skeptical about what? Seventy-five percent. I don't know for sure. ...I don't think so. He's kind of a miracle. He's doing well today. We are. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne. When? Yeah? Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there. What's he look like? Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York. Jeremy listen to what-- I'm not. I just didn't connect it. That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me. Elijah was wrong. Know what? That's great. I see. There's no more left? How many did you put on that time? What do you do if something happens? Two hundred and seventy. How much did you take off? No Jeremy. No. You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds. No. No. There's nothing to do. I'm going to work out. Jeremy. I'm going in. I have to do some things. Why'd you do that? I'm going to go in. In under six seconds. I've heard. How about your room then? If you get scared like before, you can come back in here? I think it's be better if I was alone. Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom? He doesn't look very threatening. Yeah, hello. Not really. You represent someone in Philadelphia? But I'm afraid of water, so that's been holding my career back a little bit. What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation. You like sports? No. No. Yes. Where are the rest of the passengers? Against a window. Fine. Okay.What about Jeb? I'm listening. Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time... No, no, no, no no... You need to go now. No. How old is Jeb? Once again please? You've made a considerably wise decision. Are you finished? I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that. That's not what I witnessed David. The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved? One last question. Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong. Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers. X-ray vision, things of that sort. You're skill. Have you ever tried to develop it? Telling when people have done something wrong? You have good instincts when it comes to things like that? But not a knife? You thought he was carrying a knife? How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon? Is there a problem? You could have poured coffee in Starbucks, you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings, you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet... You could have been one of ten thousand things... but in the end, you chose to protect people. You made that decision... and I find that very, very interesting. Now all I need is your credit card number. Why is it, do you think, that of all the professions in the world... you chose protection? We've already begun. Not money. But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution. I've come to understand that... An ill advised purchase in the parking lot. You've misunderstood. Technically no. I gambled that you would attend the church service. I just waited for you. This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years... And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed. And just like that, an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality. The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head. I assumed because of the train. Was it serious? What's he talking about? Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level. Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical. How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life? You've never been sick? I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals. I own a comic book museum. It's called the Limited Edition. There have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years. I've followed each one of them... A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off. One hundred and seventy-two die. No survivors... A hotel fire downtown. Two hundred and eleven die. No survivors... And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city. One hundred and thirty one die. One survivor. He is unharmed. I've spoken with your husband about his survival. I suggested a rather unbelievable explanation. Since then, I've come to believe, that my explanation, however unbelievable, is in fact, true. ...And everyone lived happily ever after. You and my mother would have a special connection. How so? Now you're going to have to tell me more. How did you get together? How long have you been married? Where is it? Why? I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.Don't be scared. I'll just shoot him once. You're lying. YOU WON'T GET HURT... You're secret identity. That man was right. I know now. Do you know why? I'm not scared. I'm sleeping in my room. All of it. Get mom. How much is it? I lied. What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him? I mean if you knew karate? How much can you lift? What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year? What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then? You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears? I'll help you. What things? Just one-- Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great. He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty-- I won't make any noise. I want to sleep here tonight.Did you get up from your seat? Was your family traveling with you? In the passenger car? Where were you sitting on the train? You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident. How's your vision? How are you feeling?That can't feel good. What? You were in an accident? Have you been hurt? What do you think? Guess. Do you? You're saying you willed these events to happen? You think you influenced her? Your friend saw them. Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern. Well, that's what we're here for. I don't know. My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle. Nope. Can't hurt. And I think it's important you find out what she wants. Try to communicate with her somehow. Fine. Do you have any idea who she is? What does she look like? How do you know it's a she? Mm-hmm. Fireball? Why is he worried? Do you really think so? Your husband? Then why did you? Who's idea was it?I didn't kill my wife. Who? I have to go. I don't know. She isn't here. This really isn't a good time. I'm running late here. I just came back for my briefcase. Yes?What? Shhhh. IT'S TRUE. That's...you have to believe me! Oh God, I'm telling you the truth! I did what I had to, Claire. She was gone. There was nothing I could do for her. I did...I put her in the lake. I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink. And I've lived with that image ever since. I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away. Don't you see, Claire? She's doing this! This is exactly what she wants you to think! I did NOT! I did not kill anyone. Jesus. Claire, listen to me. I walked in and she was lying there dead. I swear to you. On my life! She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me! To destroy us! If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have-- Okay. Don't...you don't understand what this is. I know. I'm cooking you dinner. What's that for? Don't think so. Huh. What? Yep. There's some great places nearby. Incredible. We should take a drive before they're gone. Spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast. Claire... How can you be sure? What? Can't you see, she's trying to kill us. We have to get out of here. We don't know that for sure. She was damaged and unstable. The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became. Finally, she showed up at the new house... Claire... I tried to break it off! ...would do anything just to be around me. And I slipped. God help me, I slipped. And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive... To Caitlin!! THAT'S NOT TRUE! You wanted to quit! And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her. I never asked you to quit! Claire, please don't... That's not what I'm sayi-- It was last year. We were having troubles. Oh God... Claire-- What? STOP IT! Who? I don't like this, this... It's too rough. Ow! I take it your not mad at me. STOP IT! ...Please stop... Stop... The... No. I'm afraid to ask what this is about. I may have seen her on campus. Sweetheart, it was over a year ago. It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving. It was a hard time. You shoved me away and ran out to the patio. I took you home. A cheap wine glass from the caterers. You started crying. I tried to comfort you... You dropped a glass. You don't remember? We walked all night... You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving... You know I am. What? Call ya later. Do I have everything? Really big bed. ...I'm pulling up, Yuri. I'll see you for dinner. Sure you won't stay? I'm sorry... Claire, please... Keep your voice down. Sweetheart-- But then you've been so much better... Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or... You know what I've got at stake with this paper. You know that. I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow. Maybe you resent how busy I've been. How did you-- Who did? How do you know this? This is the Feur thing? What are you doing out here? Are you lonely? I never said... Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years. If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong. What can it hurt to talk to someone? Harvey says he's amazing. There we go. I know I'm not at the center of the bridge. Restaurant. Let them know we're running late. ...like it never even happened... When you do this, I swear... Yes, tonight. We're going to be-- ...since Caitlin. You don't remember this? What do you mean? Claire, we talked about it. You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since... Dinner. With Stan and his new girl. Claire, listen to me. I know you're under some strain. But there's no such thing as ghosts. They don't exist. Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed? Right. And why is she here? If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him? Who did? Mrs. Feur? What am I looking at? She could be out. She could be sick in bed for all we know. It's a ghost. From the sun. It's a reflection on the glass. It's a flare. Our house. And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic-- What? What's going on, Claire? Oh, right. Yes. Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart. Wouldn't hurt a fly. Sorry. You understand. You didn't? Did you tell her? Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe. "...for my father." "...of Perpetual Distances." Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop. "I'm afraid you've mistaken me," I say... "...especially Spencer's Theorem..." And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..." He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us... Ohmigod. You'll never believe...I saw Schumway... You know what that does to me. Yep. I think so. Maybe. Think I may have cracked it. I've got the conference next week. I want you to feel safe. What kind of whispering? Of course. Did you call the police? What do you mean? Some noises where? What are you doing here? Claire? Unless you need me to come home... I'm stuck here for another couple of hours. Is it gone? Mmnph. Look, I'll call Harvey Tomes in the Psych department, see what I can find out. It's what I've been working for. Nothing's going to happen. Besides, I have to work tonight. The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer. This is... Claire... ...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake. Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of-- Why? Remember how we were? Honey, they're young. They're probably newlyweds. Did she say that? Of what? I'll be there. I'm finished at three. No. Squash with Stan. Maybe we should just... And we moved out here for the quiet. Did you... Wanna fool around? Tired? It's just us now. You did a great job. She's a good kid. You are... You know what I mean. It's just she's been the focus for a while. It's okay if you're not. How are you? No, no. I'm just about... There. Nice. Almost done. How is it? Whatcha reading? Claire? It's today? Claire, I have to show up for the-- Alright. I can't take the rejection. I'm going to class. When's she out of here? We'll be quiet. Quick and quiet. Feur, I think. Psych department. Figures. They're all psychotic. Three weeks. Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
