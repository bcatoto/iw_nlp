They do to! She okay? Wow No The "real you". I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually. Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure... What crap? No... You always been this selfish? Then that's all you had to say. You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you? I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied". Have fun tonight? I believe we share an art instructor Looks like things worked out tonight, huh? So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? She's not a... I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. Sure have. How do you get your hair to look like that? You have my word. As a gentleman You got something on your mind? There. Well, there's someone I think might be -- That's because it's such a nice one. Right. See? You're ready for the quiz. Let me see what I can do. That's a shame. Why? Seems like she could get a date easy enough... Cameron. Forget it. Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night? Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you. You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score. No, I ' m not. The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her? Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - It's her favorite band. Okay! I wasn't sure Her favorite uncle Number one. She hates smokers Will Bogey get bent? This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party. You got him involved? I thought you hated those people. That's what I just said Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not? They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? He seems like he thrives on danger What about him? I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. That's her? Bianca's sister? You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada He always have that shit-eating grin? Why do girls like that always like guys like that? Why not? Who is she? That girl -- I -- That I'm used to. How many people go here? Thirty-two. Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though. North, actually. How'd you ? So they tell me... You get the girl. She kissed me. She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote What'd you do to her? Sure She's partial to Joey, not me It's off. The whole thing. Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night. Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion". I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful. And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom. You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class. Hey, sweet cheeks. My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year. It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff. So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week. Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday? It's more And why would I do that? Your sister here? Where ya goin? Not at all They're running the rest of me next month. The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know. Get her to act like a human How'd you do it? A deal's a deal. Forget it. What? Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date. When I shell out fifty, I expect results. Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation. Fine, thirty. I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend. You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors. But you'd go out with her if you had the cake? You just said Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her. What do you think? You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested. You and Verona? I hear you're helpin' Verona. Does this conversation have a purpose? We're not. We don't chat. Are you lost?Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress. Extremely unfortunate maneuver. You told me that part already. Assail your ears for one night. He's pretty! Dead at forty-one. It's a lung cancer issue Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass. In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out. Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca. Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side. Did she actually say she'd go out with you? I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz... What makes you think he'll do it? You wanna go out with him? Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point? The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. You could consecrate with her, my friend. Guess who just signed up for a tutor? You know French? Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted. I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility. Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it You burn, you pine, you perish? Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood. Couple thousand. Most of them evil Get out! How many people were in your old school? I was kidding. People actually live there? So -- which Dakota you from? C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour. You the new guy? Hey -- it's all for the higher good right? What? We took bathes together when we were kids. Uh, yeah. We're old friend So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job. But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right? Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested. Nope - just came by to chat Hey. Kat a fan, too? Macbeth, right? Oh yeah. Cool pictures. You a fan? Hey there. Tired of breathing? Sweet love, renew thy force! So you got cozy with she who stings? I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows. Ever been to Club Skunk? Just for now. Good enough. We're your guys. Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl. That's where we can help you. With Kat. I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's. The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford. What?Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in? Always a pleasure, Brucie. What's the worst? Where? You makin' any headway? She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day. I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it. Then, go get her Cameron -- do you like the girl? What 're you talking about? Cameron, I'm a little busy Don't make me do it, man So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments? What've you got for me? Yeah -- we'll see. I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux -- Do what? It's about time. Forget her sister, then. A hundred bucks a date. I just upped my price I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. I'm on it Fifty, and you've got your man. I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks. How much? You're gonna pay me to take out some girl? You need money to take a girl out Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it. Two legs, nice rack... Yeah Don ' t you even dare. . . Because I like to torture you. Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her. Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl. I thought you could use it. When you start your band. I didn't care about the money. It wasn't like that. Wait I... It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook? That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story. My grandmother's . Oh huh It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress? Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company. You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that? So I have to have a motive to be with you? Why not? No what? You know what I mean Go to the prom with me No one else knows You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me. I hate peas. Hearsay. Fallacy. You up for it? You never disappointed me. Then you screwed up So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered? Yes So what's your excuse? A soft side? Who knew? So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way? I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off. Maybe. Forget it. I'm stayin'. Try lookin' at it from this angle I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights. Look up, sunshine So what did I have an effect on ? Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist. Wholesome. Pleasant? I heard there was a poetry reading. Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy. No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ... Who? So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass? I'm gettin' there You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission. Start a band? Do what? Then why'd you ask? Maybe. Busy And I'm in control of it. Kat! Wake up! I thought you were above all that I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type. Dorsey. Why'd you let him get to you? See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred? Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me. Sure, I do I told you Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced. What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference... Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep You're not okay. Okay? I say, do what you wanna do. What's this? Why, don't you? You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there. Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me. Excuse me? hey. Great show, huh? You're not a big talker, are you? I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi. Seven-thirty? Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass... Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me. You hate me don't you? I know a lot more than that The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back. Pick you up Friday, then There's a way to get a guy's attention. I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'? Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you. You were right. She's still pissed. No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose. I'm likin' you guys better Yeah. Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"? What?! You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast? So Dorsey can get the girl? Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash. What is it with this chick? She have three tits? What plan? Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say. Say it See you next week! Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... What's to discuss? Touch of the flu. It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch. I missed you.I'm missing something. You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story. It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for? The prom? Kat has a date? Because she'll scare them away. Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present. Just for a minute Wear the belly before you go. Oh, God. It's starting. If Kat's not going, you're not going. Otherwise known as an orgy? And where're you going? Exactly my point Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night. No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion. Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check. You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game. No -- impressed. Bianca did what? Which parts? So tell me about this dance. Was it fun? I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to? Funny. Was that your sister? You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it. As a parent, that's my right Why can't we agree on this? Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me? My insurance does not cover PMS Enough! I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0. That ' s what I thought Did I have anything to say about it? What just happened? But -- who -- what --? What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day. Pirate -- no question. You're not helping. Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating? Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country. Make anyone cry today?How cooperative. Longdale will keep you company. Bring the film, or we kill him. Can you guess what I'm going to say next? Friend of yours? You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you? Shut up, cunt! Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat. Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully. Take out your gun! Mister Welles... would you be so kind as to remove any firearms from your person? Hmm? Oh, the knifes? They're just props. Nice, aren't they? They should be here any minute. Excellent. You brought the money? Brooklyn. Don't be late. He's in. It will be his pleasure. I'll do this for you. Fifteen thousand dollars. You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture? What's the problem? You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it. I'd like to take your picture. You don't mind? Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit? Very good. He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand. Machine. I'll consider it. And they are? Is it? You said something about money. Hmm. Flattering. And, who's your colorful little chum? What can I do for you today? You betrayed us. First things first. You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles... Leave him alone. Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max. Put the gun down, take the handcuffs. Handcuff yourself to the bed.What the fuck... ! Dino... Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out! I'm telling you... The loop! The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?! This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop... I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop. You got the guts, tough guy? Gonna kill us all, is that it? ... sorry... Fuck off. You're a dead man. Move it, dirtbag... ! Is that him? What do you want? You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ? I never killed anyone. Do it! Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore. You think it's so easy? Do it. I fucking don't know. What do you think... we weren't burying treasure. We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it. We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine. I don't know... ... out there somewhere. You got absolute zero. You can't go to the cops. All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing... Where do you think you're taking this, huh? Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world? How you gonna do that... ? Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods. There wasn't nobody around. This place was a shit-hole. I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries. Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work. What do you want to know? You saw it, you saw the loop... Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that. It was just something I was doing for money. I don't know. I felt like it. I never saw anyone get done before. Why? Fuck you then, you want to know? I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star. I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey. When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it. That's what happened. She's dead. She's been dead a long fucking time. Nobody fucking cares! What the fuck do you want from me? Something like that. It was a lot of fucking money. Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker. Yeah. Yeah, the fucking lawyer. What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for? He was Dino's boy, not mine. He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on. Nobody knows. I told you, I don't know. I don't know... What do you want? Fuck you! How'd you find me here? I'm gonna kill you. What's he talking about? What the fuck are you.. ? Who is this. What? Yeah, who's this? Celebrity Films. Fuck you! Look, you cocksucker... Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that? You know how my tapes sell. People eat this stuff up.He's lying. Give me the film. Give me the film. You almost went over your limit. Because he could. He did it because he could. What other reason were you looking for? Isn't it incredibly obvious? A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain... You're asking me why? You're making me very angry. Shut your mouth and drive! Shut up. None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. A girl no one even remembers. They're no friends of mine. Never mind how I found you. I was well compensated. That's trust. Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly. Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature. Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval. You are a private investigator? As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend. Yes, I do have something to say. I insisted on being here as soon as I heard Mrs. Christian contacted you.Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head. Till then, fuck you. The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie. Where do you get this stuff? I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month. Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?Look... that's awful generous and everything... What's this? Still don't want to tell me what you're doing? What's next? I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil." What kind of Junior P.I. would I be if I didn't go with you? Nobody knows his name. That's his thing. He always wears a mask. You never see his face. He calls himself "Machine," that's what they call him. Machine. I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players... Wha... ? Oh, come on, man, what are we doing in this flea bag? Great. You didn't say it was gonna be this luxurious. See ya. You want me to come out there and play private eye? I'm a working stiff, pops. He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art. Nothing illegal, it's always borderline. Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a... Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look. He'll also do commissions, for enough money... You're learning. His stuff comes out of New York. Bondage and fetish videos, Gothic Hardcore. Definitely not for the squeamish. Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo. So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this? I see a ring on your finger. You have any kids? You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb. So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver? Go to Harvard? Run for President? What about you, pops? Yeah, I'm a real genius. What choices have I got? Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it. I work a job. It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers. I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed. What are you talking about? I don't know, where are yours? Twenty-five. First of all, basement sales like tonight aren't gonna last much longer. It's too risky, one, and two, everything's going on the internet. Anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants. It's heaven for those degenerate chicken-hawks. They're swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap 'em. But, there's still some weird shit under the counter where I work sometimes. No one knows where it comes from. That's local underground, where information spreads by word of mouth. Those are zombies, hardcore junkies. Their hands are permanently pruned. They go out in the sun they don't burn, they blister. Other than that, all I know about is the mail. Classified ads in the paper with hidden codes. Secret couriers. Credit card orders to dummy corporations. Interstate wire transfers. Revolving P.O. boxes. But, if you're asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit... who knows? That's the whole point -- the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible, and vice versa, and cops can't trace the deal. There's ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is. I heard you asking. That guy wasn't yanking you around. There's no such thing. There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal. Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal. This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love. Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line. How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not? Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn. Rape films, but there aren't many. I've never seen one. What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend. We're talking about stuff where people get hurt. Specialty product. You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc. Nobody even considers them pornography anymore. Then, there's mainstream hardcore. Triple X. The difference is penetration. That's hardcore. That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are. They pump out 150 videos a week. A week. They've even got a porno Academy Awards. America loves pornography. Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying. Somebody's buying those videos. Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex. Know what else? It's only gonna get worse. More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution. Desensitization. Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive! Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out. Know what I mean? For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while. They have to be the biggest tits ever. Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally. Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go. Wake up, pops. Your education begins tonight. Tomorrow night, I get off at eight. Sounds good, pops. Four hundred a week, off the books. How much? From Pennsylvania. P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here? You're a private eye. Like Shaft. You're not a cop, are you? If I ask and you are, you have to tell me. There's not much illegal. Max. Three, four years. I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight. Thomas Welles. Nice picture. Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right? Told you you would. Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be? I tear off the cover and paste this one on... You know how it is. Once you pick it up you can't put it down. It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one. My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling. Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina? Big date tonight?How will I get it to you? Fine... Nothing more than a bother. Have you any news for me? I've been ordered into bed. The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment. How are you? Having any luck? Hello? You told me to look, so I looked. Okay. Do you think the film could have cost that much? Hello... ? To the penny. Exactly one million dollars in cash. Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars. One was for two hundred thousand, one dollar and thirteen cents. Another was for three hundred thousand, six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents... The checks were for odd amounts... My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash. I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her. You've found missing persons before. Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her. No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first... I told you I can't, not yet. Will you watch it and see for yourself? I'm telling you it's not that. No. I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police... This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could. It's a film... of a girl being murdered. Cash, stock certificates, and this... There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize... My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is. Just curious. Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles? We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply. Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary. His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma. A terrible, terrible dilemma. As you know, my husband passed away recently. Two weeks ago now. You are highly recommended. Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality. I've spoken to friends of mine and my husband's, in Harrisburg, in Lancaster and Hershey. Asking about you. I must say you have friends in influential places. He's a lawyer. Please, sit, here... Have a pleasant evening. Will you have tea, Mister Welles? Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak. Mister Welles. You're very prompt.Why... why are you doing this to me... ? No... no... no... No... Who are you? Who is this... ? What... ? What are you talking about... ? I remember. You just left... Hello... ? What am I supposed to do? Forget her? Time heals all wounds, right? She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that. But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her... ... or her being dead and me knowing... I'd choose to know. I think about it everyday. But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her. Yes. My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me... How... how can you say that to me...? No. You don't have any reason to think that... I don't know. I think so. There wasn't one. The police looked. What? You should be. Are you religious? Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother. Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time. That's when you start going to church. Okay. People remember me from the news. Can you drive me back now? No one knows what it's like. You can't even imagine how much it hurts. You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either. There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never. My husband... his heart broke when Mary left... It got to be too much for him. We were divorced by then. Things fell apart... he was living with a friend... Yes. I don't know. She didn't seem herself. For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it. One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone. She took some clothes. No. I didn't think there were private detectives anymore, except on TV. They hired you. You're like, a private detective? No. Neil... Neil Cole. Yes, but... I don't understand, who are... ? Yes... ?I just talked to her. She's all I've got. She's the only witness. Mrs. Christian. Amy... Don't... I don't know what to say Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us. I was in hell. If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that. You don't understand... I wanted to call. I couldn't. I don't know. I'm sorry... It has to be this way for now. It won't be long. I can't tell you, Amy. You know I can't. You have to trust me... I'm okay, honey, I'm okay. Are you alright? Just do it, Amy, please, go. I'm okay. Please, honey, I can't explain. Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out. I'm on my way. I'll be back at the house in three hours. Call me from the hotel when you get there Amy, just listen. Take Cindy and get out of the house. Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there... Amy, it's me. Listen very carefully.. I'm not gonna need it. I won't even wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry about me. It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation. Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way. This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money. I'm not using him again for anything. He was worthless. You have bridge here Saturday? Sure. I'll call the guy. I love you. Honey, I'm not, please... Business was fine. I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there. We've been all through that. I've been on my best behavior. Well, I'm not smoking, okay? You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing? Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ? Smoking? I'm not smoking. Do you know how much I missed you? You know where I can get it? I have a lot of money to spend. Snuff? Anything harder? What are these? I'll get it. It's in a safe deposit box, in the city... He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this... Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go... I remember him. Look, I don't know what this... What are you... ? Sure. What are these for? Where are the women? Right here. Where's that? Machine's in? Those are two different kinds of trust. Thank you for your time. I hope we can do business. I'm camera shy. I'd rather you didn't. We can do that. If it's not him, there's no deal. And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask. I want to watch you work. Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course. Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations. That's five thousand dollars. Yes. What we're looking for is rather specific. A fellow investor. I'd like to commission a work. I'm a great admirer of yours. It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for seeing us. You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind? Any good? They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them. They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear. This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved. They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever. Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal. For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive. I figured you share information. Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife. What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe. They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city. Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone. Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself... That's the last they saw her. The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch... They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright. Absolutely. Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out... What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive. And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens... Call me Tom. That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." Almost makes you worse. Easy enough for you. Don't think I won't. Where? Show me where. Show me where you buried her. Stop talking. Keep moving. Show me. What did you do with her body? Nobody saw you bring her in? Tell me what happened. You enjoy it? Because we're going there. Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it. I want to know. I want to know exactly what you did to her! What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ? So... you brought Dino in, and he brought Machine. And, one day, a girl walked into your office because you had an ad in the paper for models. And she never walked out. That's all? Thirty each. That's all it took for you to murder her? How much did he pay you? Told him you could get him a snuff film. Okay, we'll come back to that. So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it. It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up. I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude. I want his name. Who is Machine? Starting to recognize a pattern? Don't ask questions. Don't bore me with that bullshit. One million dollars, Dino. How much did he tell you he had... You killed that girl and you put it on film. You and your pals, you're fucked. You fucked up real good. You murdered that girl, Eddie. Six years ago... I know what you did. I know what you did. Eddie. Look at him. You think he played it square? How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself? Go ahead, shoot me. Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield. You'll get it when we get there. Fuck you. Enlighten me. Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered? I'm asking. Just tell me. Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really? What the fuck did he want with a snuff film? Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up? Tell me, because I really want to understand. Did he jerk off to it? You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ? Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered. You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one. Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one... Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name. Her mom remembers her. Except, you're willing commit murder with them. Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies... That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me. You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. How'd you find me? Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money. So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy. And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege. You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself. That's right. Of what sort? I'm listening. It's not my money. The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought. Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay? Go be a race car driver. Go run for President. Whatever. It's money. People use it to purchase goods and services. Nope. I'm trying to figure that out myself. I have to see Machine without his mask. "Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite. You don't need to be here. Who is he, his name? Who is he? Who is this, in the mask? Who is he? It's cheap, and people know to mind their own business. What have you got for me? It's their Presidential Suite. Consider it. Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts. I'll call back. Take a vacation. I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses. Well, I'm in New York now. What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand? Alright, I get the picture. Where does he sell it? Specialty product. A weirdo making S+M films? Who'd have thought it? Good question. A daughter. What about me? You're telling me it doesn't get to you? You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else. I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this? Where are your parents? How old are you? What other ways are there to get illegal films? Who do you see? Snuff films. Child pornography. Interesting theory. ... Hello... ? See you then. Oh, and, don't call me "pops." Here's my number if you need it... When can you start? Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days. How much do you make now? Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money. Not quite. I'm not a cop. Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know. I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great. If not, speak now. Well, here's the deal, Max. This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally... What's your name, if you don't mind me asking? How long you been working there? Good for you. I need some information. Thought you might be able to help. Remember me? Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts. Truman Capote. Catchy title. What are you really reading? Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting. I'll risk it. Well, it's tempting, but no thanks. Pardon me? Yeah... guess so. If you have a pencil and paper, I'll tell you how to send it. I've got about five thousand left in cash, but I'll need another thirty, if you approve. I've made progress. I'm in Manhattan. Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update. I hope it's nothing serious. I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright? Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here. You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian. Send it to me through the post office like we arranged. No return address. You dug this up all by yourself? For a human life... murder on film, no statute of limitations. Who knows? It sure could have. I'd like you to overnight me a copy of those checks, then put them in a safe deposit box. I'm here. You're joking. Okay, I follow you so far... I'm not positive this means anything. Okay... Nothing remotely like this. I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations... It won't work like that. You don't have any other choice. You... you need to go to the police. Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about. I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it. If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play... Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects... Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film." But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth. Like, red light district folklore. There's no such thing, I can assure you. I'm afraid I don't... Do you want to tell me what you found? You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that. I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason. He succeeded. Pittsburgh? I'll do whatever I can to help. My condolences. I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire. He's odd. Thank you. Uh huh, pleasure. I try to be. They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry. It happened a month after she ran away. She's been dead all this time... They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her... He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes... They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her... Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her... Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead. She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress... I have to tell you something. It won't be easy for you to hear. It's about your daughter... Mary Anne... When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware. If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true... Mrs. Mathews? It's Thomas. Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter... It's been six years. You were right. I didn't find anything. I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry? You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go. Police are just as human as you or I. They could have missed something. They probably didn't. Wouldn't you rather know? Will you let me look? If the police focused their search in her room, her belongings, well that'd be only natural, but they may have been looking in the wrong place. It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it. She might have wanted to tell you something... Do you think the police did a good job? It's not really my place, but it's not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either. See, I know a little about missing persons. When kids run, they almost always leave a note. It's guilt. They want to say goodbye. I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though. No. We're all like that. I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time. Maybe we can finish tomorrow. I'll call tomorrow... Of course. I had to ask. I apologize. I didn't mean to... You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter... Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse? Why do you think he did it? September 4th, 1993. About a year after Mary disappeared. If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask. Your husband... he committed suicide? What was she running from? She just seemed... depressed... ? So, she didn't leave a note? She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left? You probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat. Drinking whiskey, chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses. Want to know what it's really like? It's sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight, pissing in a plastic bottle, pardon me, because some guy thinks his wife's cheating on him. Glamorous, huh? And the guy who hired you, he has a hair-lip, dandruff and crooked teeth, and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wife's cheating, and you don't blame her. That's exactly what I am. It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations. It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts. All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope. Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair. Born April 24, 1976. Missing June 11th, 1992. A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ? Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me. He didn't call? What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere... These volunteer organizations are sort of interconnected, functioning hand in hand with law enforcement. The R.C.M.P. brought me in to review their investigations... ... fact-check their records, see if there's anything they missed, anything they should be doing different. I'm here for a few days, before I head back up to Virginia. These reports go to the Justice Department eventually. I spoke to your F.B.I. contact a few days ago, uh... I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington. I'm sure you've dealt with them before? I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit. If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter. Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator... I'll do what I can. Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time? Her belongings? What is this? I'm trying to find out. She was a runaway. I'm looking into it for her parents. You... you do? You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure... Certainly, Senator. If I can ever be of further assistance. The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all... No, sir, he is not. Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day, saw that woman every night. The specifics are in the report, and information about the woman. It's unpleasant, I know. I apologize... Yeah, I know the spiel. If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you. No, you may not. Cash. Okay, I'll take it all.She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance? No, I'm not! My mom taught me. Really? I'm Adam Webber. Thank-Q! You like it? I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here. Hi! The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill! Yes, ma'am. I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow. For how long? Come where? Fallout shelter. There's a difference. How do you do? It certainly is. I agree with you completely. Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself. I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well? Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair? Please excuse this interruption. Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just-- How do you do? My mother's like that. See! I can't tell them that! I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke. I can't let that happen. You understand? Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again. ...All right, Eve. If you say so. Hi, Eve! And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious! It was at least as good as the sky. Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first. Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour. Yes, Eve? No. "All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves. But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it? I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable. Thanks. I know first aid! Eve, if you'll let me, I can -- What? I know...and I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry! Eve?! But, Eve, I would-- Eve, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962-- No. I admire you. I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most-- I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied. Why are you suddenly so mad at me? You wanted to see me! Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end. Okay. All right. And what do I say? That's ridiculous. Really? What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her? Okay. I like that. How 'bout this one? Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you. Why?! I think she's very attractive. What about her? It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told. I like her. I thought I was here to meet women. Good-bye! Do I look crazy? My goodness gracious! This place is something! Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend. Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left! No it's not! I certainly do! Yep. You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that. Hey, Eve! Okay! It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair! Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo. About clothing? The guy with the underpants! The what? All right. May I please be excused? In the house? He has a computer? Where's he gone? Good for you. Wow. Yes! Um-hum. Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em! Thank-Q! Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants. Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question? I like it. Is this your house? You said it would be easy! I told you I've never driven before! Sorry! Yes, ma'am! The engine is still running. Of course. That's what I was afraid of. Two weeks. And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena. One who's not a mutant. It didn't used to be that way. They're all divorced? I didn't know that. It does? Bites what? I don't want to be alone. Because I want to get married. Yes. Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife. This is for me. Then forget it. Well, this is going to sound a little crazy. There's something else I would like you to help me with. Okay. And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh... You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - - but, I'd just be lost without you. I guess we'll need another locker. We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry. Hey, you know. I was thinking... Sorry. Wait! Wait! Hey! Pipe tobacco! I'm going to need all of this! This is swell! My Mom and Dad. They like Dr. Pepper. You got it! Wait here while I change. What's fair? Two weeks. Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help. Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks. Why not go to work for me? ...Okay. Why does it never work out? You and...men? Why doesn't it never work out? Cross my heart and hope to die. Watching television in color. I think it's the eyes. Thank-Q! Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend? Can't you please just talk to me for one second? Wait, Eve, please! Wait. I haven't brushed yet. Okay. I can't, it's yours. I am so glad to see you!! I thought I'd never see you again! Right. That was...wonderful! I've never felt anything like that in my life. Gee-zooie!! You better slow down!!! Hey, what are you doing?! Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off! Oh, I could die... Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back! It's Perry! Wait! Wait! It's Webber. Adam Webber. Heck, no! What?! Yes. Yes. So what?! I've got two of him! And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too. He's all yours. I was holding him back. Wait! Please wait! I'll make a deal with you! I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel! I'm sorry! I said something wrong, didn't I! Please forgive me! Nope. If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun. Do you own a car? It was amazing. Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right! Again. Right. So far? Oh, that's nice. I don't know. Why doesn't it? I came on a bus. I just had a mental picture of... Dickhead? Say,...did you just lose your job because of me? No, I'm lost. Where are we going? Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam. Get out of here! No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business. Bon soir, mademoiselle! Of course! A card? Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel. Nothing. Is this because of the radiation? Gee-ma-nee! Is that a birthday cake?! I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man... I promise. How do I leave here? That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it. I've got to go, now. I know it has been terrible. But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand? All in yellow? Oh! That was my father! Are you all right? Uh, I think they have. Yes. That's kind of how it was. Yes, sir. It's true. Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over. Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers. It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here. And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why. I'll try. I promise. Is that all? Adult Bookstore. Why? Yes, sir. Is that all? Yes, father?! Yes? Merci! Shit is a French word? Well, do we just go on up?! These are really swell! I mean swell! Holy Cow! What the heck are these?! No kidding! Oh, boy! A jacket! Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad! Then why go there? Why? The nocturnal flying mammal? Like one of Mom's? Like a painting? What's baseball? These are wonderful. Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?! Gerade aus dann links! Tempus fugit! Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday. They're pretty. Can I have them? And thanks for always being happy! Bye, Troy! Goodbye. Does that work? No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on. What? You bet! Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties! No! There's an Adult Bookstore back there! I'll be right back! Okay. Thank you, my friends. Ladies first, Troy! That was close. Oh. I see. Why did you park way back there? I LOVE THIS!! Amazing. I'm very impressed. The recovery is very impressive. I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new. No. I just don't want to. I'm not wearing his pants. ...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste. Yes. He likes windows. Oh, yes. It would probably kill him. That would knock my father out. Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America. No. I don't think so. It's so small. This must be very new. Sorry, that's the largest city. Juneau. 1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course. Russia. 1959. I've got goose-bumps all over me. I've never met anyone like you in my life. Right on the button. Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic. It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there. I love Lucy! Not particularly. You have very nice ceilings. Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight. I guess living up here makes people look older. How old do I look? Thirty-five. Good night! Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite! That's what my Mom always says... ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry. It's my first night away from home. My father is a genius. I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice. Of what? Just look!! Up there!! The sky!!! Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is! Would you excuse me? Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles! Come on. Frozen. How much are they? Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties. Good! How do you do, ma'am. Oh, my holy stars! A Negro! I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry. Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again. Oh, that would be wonderful! See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that. I was thinking of selling all the cards. Hello. Yes. Eve and I...eloped. We're married. No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office. We have to go. I can't explain it now. But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then we'll be back to get you. Mom? Eve and I have to go. I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist. ...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down. But we've got to hurry. Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so. Mom? Right. Yes, ma'am. I'll be all right. I'll go up. Dad! Sorry, Mom! Yes, ma'am.Goodnight. Up here on the fifteenth floor? Twenty-five? Around there. You don't look thirty-five. How old are you? No kiddin'. Well...good night. Thank you. Your father is a smart guy. The hotel. You dial nine to get out.Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh... They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes! My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em! "No, we didn't drop any bombs! Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed! Poor, poor us!" I bet they've even asked the West for aid! Right?! Uh-huh. What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?" That's what everybody believes? You're sure? Uh-huh. This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it? Well, in that case...of course, son. But, I don't understand. One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you. Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget. Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore." ...the pipe tobacco. Adam...don't forget...don't forget ... C'est bon, Monsieur. Helen-Thomas-Webber! Maybe we have been down here a little too long! Please excuse her French. No, son! We wait for night. Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious. Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better! Your mom made that all by herself. Blow out the candles! Because he must! Because he's forced out at third! It's a force! No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there! No. Sit down. Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat. No, son. A pitcher. It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher. It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now. You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son! I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me. Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren! En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul�! You're right! It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?! Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam. This is what money looks like. It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper. Or you can have an "investment." These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name. Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable. No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to go! I have to... Really? Yes, I can tell that just looking around. "Boy?" Did you say you were a "country boy?" Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here? So...you...survived the blast, did you? What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light! Some time. To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about. I thought ten years. And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam. Amen. He's smart. --do as I say! --and we will-- Well, I am the head of this household-- We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then-- Yes. We stay down here. They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't. Yes. Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously. It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now! I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants. It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good". Should we say a little prayer first? I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey? In the generator room again? Sure. You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon? If we still have one. Yeah. Let's dig in! Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful. One who doesn't glow in the dark. Well, we did in my family! If he tells, it won't come true! And I made these! You bet. Coming! Hi, honey! I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches. Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be. Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us! Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is! What? Yes. Well... yes. No reason. Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator! Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway. Right here! What? Whatever you want, Helen! Yes! No. I think it's just right. I've noticed. Is there a problem? Honey? What? I told you! I've got everything! Would you like a tranquilizer? How could you?! This is just like home! Really? Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite! Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut. We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child. Hi, honey! Feeling better? To go up. Then after that it's safe. To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years. The locks. Home sweet home! Yes, dear! I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to. Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto! I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio. Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip? I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning. You hear that?! No. They all do. It shuts off automatically. It's time. I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance! You bet, hon! Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.What? Bye, Adam! Good-bye, Adam. Yeah...Seems to. I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses. A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore. So, did you buy a movie? How 'bout we check with Eve first? I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I? I'm so sorry. Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool. What?! Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car. That's why little things mean so much to him. The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months. Almost all of them. Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that? Okay. Why not? He has great pants. Not on him. True. Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that? He's a Windows guy then, huh? Yeah? Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat! How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak? You don't have a computer in your cabin? What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker? Yeah. Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha! What's the capitol? When did we get it from them? Who use to own it? Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state? Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife? Isn't that closer? She's right?! That's right? Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town. Really? Since when? And it's called...? You nut! Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi. I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings? Where?! Yeah. Maybe he'll call. None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards. An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley? No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store. We came back to the house! To get some frozen poultry. I don't know. I like to think so. Yeah! That's thinking. Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?! See these? Found them in the box with the cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT&T. Polaroid. What's wrong? And if we can't find him? What do you want to do with it? Fallout shelter. Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome! What?! I know...I know. You did the right thing. I don't think so. What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door? It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear. He left with Sophie. He didn't leave with them. From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo. Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses... He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady! You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior. Know what else he told me? Yes, you do! Uh, yes, you do. Yes, you do. Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy. To bed. Yeah. But who's not a slut these days? Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me. What's it to you?! We did not leave together. Uh..he might of. Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure! Um... Eve? Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet." Eve?! Always good advice. He's from Alaska. How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block? Let me show you the entire trousseau! Well, what do you think? What do you think, Adam? Alright, I will. That's what I'm sensing. I see "elegant." I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits. It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men. You're serious, aren't you? I don't know. But first, you have to start with the clothes! Oh, my God... Oh, yes. So, Adam...where on earth are you from? Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse. Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!We're here brother. Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here. This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will. Shit. Look again for fuck sake! Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know you fuckin' know! Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit. No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole. This place is like a scumbag yard sale. What the fuck are you doing? I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who. Yeah, well... Anybody see ya? Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit! What happened? Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in. He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years? He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy? Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets. Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room? Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night. You sound real remorseful. Donna's gonna be angry about her cat. Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco. Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison. Yes. Get a hold of yourself, man. Certainly illustrates the diversity of the word. Let's do him right here. This is a six-shooter. Where's your gun? Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first? Yeah, we promise. Well, I didn't but... Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts. How's Uncle Sibeal? No ma! No! Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it woman?! Now just calm down here. What?! What are you doin'? What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!? Mother, what are you sayin'? You're talkin' crazy here. Ma, what's wrong? Mother, is that you? Hello. I'll call you tonight, afterwards. We're going to hit Poppa Joe tonight, right in the comfort of his own home. Then we move on to New York. It's getting a bit hot for us here. I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again. Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties. Our mother can see through bags. We paid attention in school. We... met them last night. me up the... Would someone please come over here and... Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out. We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense. We're alive. For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it. These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies. It is your evil, who will be sought by us. We do not want your tired and sick. Now, you will receive us. He isn't to be touched. And he is one smart man. A-fuckin'-men! Rocco, this is the real deal. We must kill without hesitation, without guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead man. So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll? I'm strangely comfortable with it. Who did you kill? Yes. Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers. Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man? Yes, we are. Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes. Aye. Sh, sh! Fuck you! We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole. We'll find it. Just calm down. See. I told you there'd be a shaft. A bit. Is that right, Rambo? I don't know they just always need it. I'm serious. Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it. Charlie Bronson's always got rope. Know what we need, man?... some rope. Destroy all that which is evil... Absolutely not. Spanish. Then I guess he's just real... real good. I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked. Italian. "Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?" Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya? A p-penny saved is worth two in the bush. "We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there." Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years. If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes. Don't even do it, ya bastard. Oh, Jesus. Aaaww, shit!... evil woman! Shut it. It's Ma. Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock. How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? Hey Murphy? I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point. Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax. Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya. Yeah? Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is... Okay then... let's get ya started.Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking. Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets. A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him. Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out. No way they could have seen it? It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other. What about one guy with two guns? They shot him at a downward angle. They put him on his knees. The Sicilians. Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver. New hitman wants to leave his mark He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head. The fat man. These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the... So what are you thinkin' here?And we will send you to whatever God you wish. There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain. Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace. With every breath we shall hunt them down. It is your corrupt we claim. We do not ask for your poor or your hungry. He's a good man. That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing. There he goes. Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord? Give the guy a shot. We've teamed up with a sex offender. So what do you think? Holy shit. Who? How many? Then what the fuck? Where are you goin'? Did you tell him? Kill em all. Admit it, even you've thought about it. Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos and walkin' on bail the same day. Nine bodies. Oh, we're good man. On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch. That was way easier than I thought. Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost! No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds. Where the fuck are you going? Just like on TV. Me, too. Nervous? All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope. What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie. Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for. Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya? What? For what? ...so that which is good may flourish No pictures, either. German. Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period. How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us? "I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan." Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us? Don't c-cross the road if ya can't get out of the kitchen. Okay. We're ready. "What do we tell him about the guns and money?" All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh? He got beat up by a girl. I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today. Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma. No fuckin' hot water man. That... How many? Aye. Aye. We promise. Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does. Just called ta torture us did ya? Oh, she's quite proud of herself. Oh my god! What the...? We'll keep going, Roc. We have to go now. We're on the lamb. You bet your ass he will. What the fuck do you mean? Well he sure as fuck knew you! Well, I'm sold. You look like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert. Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps. So? Liberating isn't it? You sure you killed them? This is some crazy shit, man! No. You sure you're okay? Roc. You okay? Hello? No. You sure you're okay? Roc. You okay? Hello? Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch. Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead! Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' retard! Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit. Who says that? You could take credit on it. We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always doing business, but we're always open. Hallelujah, Jaffar. Right now.Forgive me father. The laws of God are higher than the laws of man. Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason? You know them personally? Then you must find out what your beliefs are. Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision. It is easy to be sarcastic about religion. It is harder to take small hints from God, your feelings and listen to them... to take a stand. You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here? You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day. You feel? You believe? God's permission? God doesn't... What is it my son? Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious? Y-Yes my son. Just go! How long since your last confession, my son? What do you want me to say? God have mercy on my soul. Have you no fear of God? Don't do this my son. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see. Yes.You gotta keep going. You guys? You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man. Okay, just calm down. He could hurt us, brother. He could ruin the whole thing. They got nothing. What? What, that guy? I know what the fuck he looks like! Fuck you! I told you I never saw him before! C'mon! You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit. Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco. Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing. What? What is it? I-I'll tip her. MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone! Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys decide who you're... I mean, who makes the cut? Is there a raffle or something? Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man. What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview. I killed em! Oh, Jesus! I killed em all!! Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out! No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled. No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it. No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it? You think they sold me out? No way. What are you saying? What? She ain't been around in weeks anyhow. Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her. But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole. Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place. Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird? Anybody you think is evil? What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS! What did you do?! Fuckin'... what the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!! Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out. Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them? Chest pocket. Shit! Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. They call me the funny fuckin' man! Male or female, bitch?!! Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!! Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... Your what?! Your fuckin' what?! I felt it would bring closure to our relationship! I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch! What? No! Fuck you! You start getting excited! We gotta fucking go! You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever. Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit. Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility. I mean he ain't here. Shit!... Shit! He ain't here. Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you! Worst day of my life, man. Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' to be professional, but no... Well, what'ya do? So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right? Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses. Y'know it is, a bit. Those rat fucks! All of them were all laughing at me man! Those cocksuckers sold me out! Hurry the fuck up! I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side. Yeah. Anybody call for me? Hey, Murph. I'm fuckin' fine. Catch you on the flip side. Yeah. Anybody call for me? Hey Murph. I'll be back at 9:00. Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know what's going on, huh? Fuck you! Fuck you! Hey. You don't know that shit for sure. What are you serious? You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm fuckin' done. Permanent package boy. Well fuck, you guys could do this every day. So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit? This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know? Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny. I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, Father. Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're bound. You can't talk about this... to anyone. Just be natural, goddamit. Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up. Father, I'll do you right here. That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing. Open it! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me! You gonna do what I say, got it? He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death." Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys... Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy. The... The funny man. Yeah boss? Poppa Joe, you want me to go now? I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas. Fuck you Vincenzo. Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.Oh fuck! Up where? Just for him? What did he bring him in for? You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them? What? Any word back from the E.R.s? Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one. Well, not armed. If they had guns, they'd have used them. But dangerous? Oh yeah. Look under the body. Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue. Look in the trash around their hands. See if you can find me two bullet casings. 45's, if my eye serves me right. Don't disturb them. Mark them as they lay. Newman, root through this shit. If this was a sink find me some metal parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain cover or something. Be careful. I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you? So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen? Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front. Know any other languages? So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian? They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that? You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh? Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends. The shooter knew these guys, huh? And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover? Theories. No. This guy is big time. These two are street-walking scum. Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here. Of course they were. How many? Can she I.D. them? That depends. You either do your job or get ethical. Fan-fuckin-tastic! And number three, Dolly. Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name- ology. Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid. God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet. Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident. These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender? Why was I not informed of this? What? Those doors were down... which means this. They looked down in through the peep hole, saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside. Pop, pop, pop, right through the glass. Why? Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's little fireman time. And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out. Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you? Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two. Now stay with me, boys. What did they do to make two such identical wounds? Did one guy put him on his knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up and shoot him again the same way? No. Two men of similar height dropped this guy down, each put some iron to his head and boom! That's all she fuckin' wrote! Excellent! Number two. Greenly. The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy. The Greeks. The Italians. That's a possibility. Y'know you Boston cops are perking up. That's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men. Another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent. And the pennies? Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon? The what man? So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie. Really want to know? Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius? Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW! Who were the victims? No way they could have seen it. After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out. Why the two extra victims? It tells us that he was the last to die. All these men Were carrying. They came in, dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man. Didn't they, Duffy?! They sure as fuck did! While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything? How many bodies, Greenly? Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table. He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly? Sweet-n-low! Twist of lemon! Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch. What's your name? Thank you, Father, thank you. Whatever. Goodbye, amen. Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them. No. They would never do that. Yes. I believe these young men are right. I want to stand for what I believe in, father. You're right. I guess not. Has he now? Yes. Yes. But in this day and age I believe what they do is... necessary. I feel it is... correct. It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically. Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should. Hello? You there?What's she so emotional about? I think Mary Agnes could kill someone. Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't. Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes. And that I can drive a truck! Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little. Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway. Why not? I mean your parents. I'm sorry, Homer. But you've studied with the old man for years ! You're a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether. He smells like he could put you to sleep! He sniffs that ether! I've seen him do it! Shouldn't we tell Homer? Why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him? What are you going to tell the little ones? What'd she die of?I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she? I doubt it. She's just an... I know. Better than I can! You cook very well! What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them? Whoever they were, they didn't do any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela. I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find them . I'm not a doctor! I'm not a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school! He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether. It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to. No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me. I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary. Sure. Thanks. She knows how to take care of herself. And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly need you... "...did." Well, okay. I helped you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right? No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you. He's alive . He still loves you. So do I. I know, I'm sorry. You got up! You did something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a decision ! I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't ever have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all... Go anywhere? Of course not! That would be doing something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to do something. Let's just sit here all night! I know. Is that nothing. Isn't that like waiting and seeing? Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do. Wait... wait ! Are you sure? Mr. Rose knows ? Well, we can't force her. It's her decision. I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere... Okay, okay--I know you do, too. Fine. That's all there is to it then. So we should "wait and see." For how long? I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said. What will be okay? Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay? Right. Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet? That's what I'd come here for. I'd watch the movie. How could you not care about the movie? Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio? Did you come here with Wally--to not watch movies? I never asked for any responsibility. I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys. I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone. It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing. The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up there ! Have you seen a lot of movies here? You think? Maybe I was. I love this place! What's the medical explanation? Oh, sure! And what did she die of, exactly? First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him... I did like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'." "King Kong". It's really good. Yes! I've only seen one, though. People watched the movies in their cars? A movie outside ? I better go. Okay... Uh... have you been feeling okay? I'm never bored! It's all very... different for me... here. Sure... I'll see you around. It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal. I understand. Oh... Where's Mandalay? I know. I've never seen the ocean, either. I've never seen a lobster. Is your family in the apple business, too? How many months are you? So, Mrs... Only the right people can have you, Curly. Nobody special enough, Curly. That's true. You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you. They wanted a girl. Don't get too excited, Fuzzy. Uh... it's the end of October. "I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it." Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right. No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep. It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right. Did you bite it? Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you. Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job. What about the trees? Migrants? Oh, I would love that, Wally. What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that! At what altitude? "Burma run" because you fly over Burma... It's all very normal. This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time. No, I'm not. I need a job. I think I'd probably like the apple business. Where are you going? I wonder if you might give me a ride. Has anyone offered you anything to eat? No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time. They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect. Liberator... What kind of plane are you flying? No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure. I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this. Right? There's more than one laceration, more than one cut. Where'd she get you? Okay. Then you can be of use. Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze. One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps. Mr. Rose, I'm in the doctor business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere. Please listen to me! Both of you... But she's your daughter ... Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes. You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter! You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible? Is it true? This is easy--I'm not hurrying. What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms. Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said... I guess so... Okay... Right. So. What should I do now? I am not a doctor. I don't need this--I know all about my condition. You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me... Of course. I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use. Try to look at it this way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator! I'm happy I amuse you. How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with? I thought it was my turn. It's your splice! You blame me for everything! Okay, he's just a Wilbur then. Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur. I don't think so. He doesn't like it. He's a boy, That's why. Nobody's named this one yet. But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped? I haven't read that. In other words, scurvy. I don't know it. It's obviously an aborticide. It looks like scurvy. There was no visible wound? One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me. All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with you performing them. Yes, for both. Right. Uh... sure. I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me. Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here. Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on. "Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch." "One: Please don't smoke in bed." How long's this been going on, Muddy? That's it. Rose, listen--don't do anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen... What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go. Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you. But you don't look very happy. I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father? You're not yet three months, are you? I don't like watching anyone be sick. You okay, Rose? Almost. Give men that. I know how to do it. I'm not in trouble. No trouble. Do you like to read? Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect. There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged. It's just my heart. Rose Rose?I just hope he won't expect us to say Grace all the time. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to meet him. What's his name again? You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples? Oh my, yes! This is a far superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies! We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the law ! What has the law done for any of us here? Don't you understand? The board is going to replace me! That's what the "new blood" is for ! "An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..." One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether. He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of course he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help commit me! He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy. Let him try to make some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it? Some new things would be useful. I don't need any "new help." They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to replace me! You were! You are ! It was fantastic. I was! I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were! Life is waiting. It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue... Try to think of nothing, Dorothy. If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us. They'll believe it because they want to believe it. I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted. She died of secrecy , she died of ignorance ... Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight. I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner! Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need! So here is my candidate. What do you think? Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They are against the law. "...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939." "Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..." I don't know! He's just leaving-- you're the one who says he needs to see the world! That's what he'll do--he'll see the world! You bet it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook. How old are you, dear? Thirteen? Someone not from Maine. No. She was an immigrant. She looks after other people's children. She's dead now, too. She was a nanny. Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him. Alcohol killed him--he drank himself to death. Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver. You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it! It's your heart--you ought to take it with you. I don't need your gratitude. Are you really so stupid that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of anybody -- not out there! In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways. Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do. Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point? Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people. How about this child? You expect her to be responsible? It is. I'll get this. You go ahead. I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it? We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have dozens ! I'm not crazy about the "Little..." You do it then. Can't a boy be a Dorrit? It's my turn! Where's the name sheet? When doesn't he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you? I haven't, either. But you will . The morons who write the books should do a little research here . Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along. Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"! Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble. If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C. Christ, it's oil of tansy! Obviously. Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a sailor ! No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually disintegrating --my stitches pulled right through the tissue! What else could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use. You know how to help these women-- how can you not feel obligated to help them when they can't get help anywhere else? I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery. First pregnancy? Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested. Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him! Does it snow in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a coffin ! No ! I don't want to know him! He's doing missionary work--in India ! I wrote him weeks ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right? That's 'cause I sticked my own knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my own knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me. She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right? If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' hitch-hikin' if she don't got a good knife with her. I'm stayin', Homer. When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'? There ain't no almost about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right? What's that? What's it called? What business is you in, Homer? You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right? And I love her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do! I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that. Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right? Ain't nobody havin' sex with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows. I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer. I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today! You still doin' it too fast! Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry. Of course there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just protein , them worms! They is good for you! Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no good cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts... Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong. That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right? Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them. It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right? Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there. What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is... It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'. That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right. You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight. Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter. Now, now. He's a good boy. Who live here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain live here... just breathin' in the vinegar? Somebody who don't live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for us . We the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our own rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer? Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? Half of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well step on 'em, too--they only good for cider. You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that. What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice? Don't this place look like home? You all take care of yourself, too, Homer! Mind your own business, Peaches. They told me I was too old to serve. That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right? That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she? She's good with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than you is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her? Tell him what you want, Muddy-- you is the crew boss today. Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy. Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do. Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about. Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view. You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help. You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl! Where do you think you're going? Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right. You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's clothes . Ain't that right, Homer? Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in. That's right--that sounds like trouble to me. You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...Homer liked it! Didn't you? He loved it! Didn't you? I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson. I love you, too. See you tomorrow. Well, picking them is! It's about as exciting as... walking! Well, they aren't. I never said they were boring. I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold. Well, this is an orphanage. I don't think so, Homer. I'm the lucky one. You're the one who's helping me , Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too. Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit? The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground. It's almost like flying. Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss. They're migrants. Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring. Actually, I volunteered. I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass. And over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump. I don't have any time. There's a war ! The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring. You're a little overqualified, aren't you? We're heading back to Cape Kenneth. Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where? Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything. Really! Is it serious? Have you enlisted? A B-24 Liberator. Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered... So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do you do the-- It's okay--I don't mind.Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me. Well, shame on him if he doesn't. And he loves you back, doesn't he? No, I mean... you love your son? You love him? Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up. What's next? Projectile diarrhea? Man. What a stud, huh? My name's not Woody, it's Haw-haw... Who's Whiskey Dick? Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself. What the hell is that? Huh? Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore. Thanks, miss. I-I c-can't... Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't... Whoa... she is a killer. Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all. What's that? Yeah, a man's drink... Got any KISS? Hawk. Any luck? For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there. ...at twenty-thirty hours. Brilliance, Trip. Sheer brilliance. Give Albert Einstein here the Nobel Prize. So maybe we got enough for one ticket. Fuck! I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say? What was that D.J.'s name again? You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. What's in Sandusky? Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo. I was just explaining to Lex here what you and I already know. Just had to make it a little more complicated so he'd understand. Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence. Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere. Stan Lee couldn't think of a better one. Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away. For once Lex is right. It's over. Things can't get any worse from here. What are you, high? Nah. Couldn't be. Tickets? Still too risky for my money. We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection... Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan. Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got... twenty-five. Cool, bro, now listen up... Now listen up. Here's the game plan. Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet. Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood. What the fuck! Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed. Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City! Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think. Ok, dudes, follow my lead. Curly. Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check? There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero? Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit. And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway? Damn straight we are. So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check? Never mind with the too bad shit. I got a crazy plan, but only the craziest among us can pull it off. Weird... Whoa... she just farted. That's Sherry VanHafton. Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there! Okay, enough. Enough. Gimme the tickets. I wanna hold onto them. YO, DOOFUS! Will somebody please tell those chicks disco is dead. How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch? Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut. Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi. So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it. No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado? Could be. Hey, disco dude, it's cool... Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man. Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me. I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin. Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour? Dude, this is all I got. Go ahead, Jam. See you at 8:30, Jam. Later. Dudes? Later. Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it. Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us. Jam, not another word out of your femmy-ass mouth! Okay, we're here, we got nothing, and we got an hour and a half. We're totally committed. It's time to brainstorm. Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels. Please, Jam, we're trying to vent some hostility here. Sure the whole thing may be your fault, but who's gonna get pissed off at you? Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense. Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes. Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. Oh no, Jam. I'm not falling for that twice. What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam? If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check? All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City. They're what? Don't be a fembot. So, are you like grounded because of last night, or what? Cool. Just check whatever you were wearing last night. Now! The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm! Anyway, listen up. They're gone! Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana. Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary. Jam, listen up.Bye. Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again. I feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I just say something a year and a half ago? Man, think of how much time we wasted. Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time. Ann Arbor? Peter Criss is my inspiration, man. If I paid a hundred bucks for a KISS show and all I saw was his solo, I'd consider it... money... Hey, how'd you know that? I dunno. I think he had the piece of skin under his tongue removed so he could stick it out farther. I'm not too up on Gene trivia. Right, slow... Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name. I don't care. I wanna hear more. Beth? I can't believe it. Yeah? It's okay. Thanks. We all beat each other up, then, once we're nice and bruised, we run over to the ticket takers and say we got mugged and our tickets were stolen. They gotta let us in then. Well... I still got my idea if anybody will let me speak. But... my plan involves all four of us acting together. Wait! I know how we can get in! I got... I'm sorry, guys. I thought it was a nice thing to do. It was stolen! Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize. Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me. It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. Well, couldn't you slow down so I can at least state my case, Hawk? If you don't like it, you can speed up and I'll never mention it again. Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off? Check. Check. Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem. She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake. They're still at my house in Trip's jacket. Of course, but has that ever stopped me before? Besides, my mom's going to some church meeting and won't be back till late. No sweat... See you guys in school. I'm really sorry about that, man. Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...? What's gone? It's my Bullworker. Hawk? I just lost my virginity in a confessional booth! Lord have mercy!! Mom, what're we...? I said, I'm sorry! If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him. You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school? Grounded for the rest of the year? They're not idiots. But, mom! Change? What's wrong with what I got on? Ahh, sunshine. Uhh... nothing. Oh, hi, mom. Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it. No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that. Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath. Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour. I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me. Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath. No. Yeah. So, you see if it wasn't for me, me and my friends would be at that KISS concert right now... together. Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.No... You don't think...? I found the Volvo. Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila! I think we should try sneaking in. ...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble! ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that... Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation. DUDES! Uh... dudes? The paint! Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit? We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car. Now, how are we gonna do this? Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school? Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something. The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar Sunday, but... Hawk, all I need is one ding on the Volvo and presto! There are my balls hanging from the rearview mirror after she gets back from Cincinnati. We are not stealing my mom's car. But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county! Too bad we're stuck in electronics or... I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life. I've been in love with her since the second grade. Check! Yeah, she gives you shit and you take it. Shit, that dork is Jam. Stellas. I hate stellas almost as much as I hate dogs. All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo. Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!? But we took the keys? I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it? Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change? Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella. Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery! Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine. Hello summer detention. Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us. The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch. We won?! Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug. Trip, it's not the end of the world, okay? Quit acting all squeezed out. Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember? I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked! If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year! Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass. Trip, you fuckin' asshole. Trip, a female gynecologist does not a lesbian make. And even if it did, at least my mom didn't give birth to me while she was on LSD. Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell. I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.I don't even think you have a gun! Don't tempt me, I'll shoot! Gimme your gun, boy! Oh, yeah! You and what army?Whatever... stella. You got in the car, didn't you? So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what? What's it worth to you? Plenty, but it was all bad. One more time in English. Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think? Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf? Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar... Disco blows dogs for quarters. Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's. Let's stop in Sandusky, Hawk. I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime. Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever. Namely? This is the best thing that ever happened to me at school! Not only are we on again for KISS in Detroit, but we're actually sitting right at the fifty yard line! I dare you dudes to find a curlier scenario. Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this? Yeah. Twenty-five more'n I got. Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John! It's gone. Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake. Let's lift up her shirt. Eyowch! This is one hot pizza! Well, here we are back at fucking school again. About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway. Simplicity, Hawk. Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it. I did it! I did it! We won! Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us! Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it! Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together! That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too? You know what they say about a big ass... big shit. What? Shrooms! And even if it was LSD, I can still give my mom a kiss without smelling the catch of the day. You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke. Jam has yet to do an overnight with us. Look, I want to live, but I don't know where the fuck I'm gonna find two hundred bucks. Two hundred bucks? Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating! Look, you can have my wallet... What do you want? Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba... A likely story. Hand it over, kid. Neither do I! Not if I shoot first! No, you gimme your gun, boy! The KISS Army!What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP! Cut her outta this! No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up! Tina! Tina!! TINA!!! English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire. You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park. Amber... Well, your "cheap whore" is this family's "lovin' mother." The Clemens said to make him look like he just came from snowmobilin'. Pink cheeks, and...Don't speak, Quellek. No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up. Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine. Okay, Quellek, let's get back to the command deck and-Suddenly we hear a PISTOL BLAST and Quellek's chest turns RED. Alexander and Quellek look down at the blood, horrified. Open. Come with me. I'll explain on the way. Quellek. What are you doing in there? Uh uh! What did we talk about? Thanks. Is that the bathroom? Where's my bed? This is it? Just don't. Don't do that. I'm not kidding. Well good, that's very... nice. Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to... Yes. Good was done this ..... Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight... "Purple skinned monstrosity...?" Hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the Commander.' You've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch! That's your problem. You were never serious about the caraft... "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this? Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT. VIBRATIONS. Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..." ... . Well you have to figure out what it wants... What's its motivation? Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it Nothing. Oh, of course, I forgot! YOU have to be the hero, don't you?... Heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! Oh no, Jason Nesmith couldn't possibly- Go ahead! Must be some sort of mining facility. THIS much. About this much. DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP! You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts We've got to stop! Like throwing gasoline on a fire... "Just!?" God, what an ass. ... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking... ...Damn you! Damn you! I won't and nothing you say- Friend. You stole all my best lines. You cut me out of episode two entirely!.. As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.' This is ludicrous. Why are you listening to this man? Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?... He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow. No offense. And note the sucked in gut. You think you could do better "Laredo?" Shut up. What's happened? Could you possibly try not to hit every single one! He wants to THINK!? Jason, what have you gotten us into? No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't. I can't! I played Richard III... He's a twit! By Grabthar's Hammer, this is true. Yes you did. Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals." You said "the Commander. He knocked me out the sonofabitch. Where is he? It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures... Nobody was WATCHING? Could they be the miners? To see if there's a pub. "Go into the cloud! ... WE'VE HAVE TO STOP! May I get the check? We heard it the first time! Oh my god, It's real. Yes, poor Jason. As we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. While here I sit eating Christmas cheese in Spring. A boy comes to the door. I still haven't got this bloody thing off. Oh good, there's nothing to eat. Oh can't I? Watch me! Dear God.... How did I come to this? He's a miserable twit!We'd better get everybody online. And Kyle, Stop downloading porn. Your frame rate is unacceptable. You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right? No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads. He probably... Has some very important business to attend to... Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat. Raise the glass and push the blue button. Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you. Up. Go. They're off again. GO Commander. Lt. Madison, GO. Wait two seconds then go. Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom... Yes Commander... All right, you're almost there. Just go through the chompers and over the pit. My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman. He's seen it 13 times... No, I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past. It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds. Well, that's the big question, isn't it? Yes Commander? Okay, that's where you want to be. Okay, so do you see a door marked "CORE UNIT?" Should be down at the far end to your left. Commander, do you have a camera? I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing. Now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility. The bowels of the ship. Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units. Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent... Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive. I knew it!... I KNEW it!... ... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a- Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but... Brandon. Oh... Oh, I see. Oh. ... Yes? Yes but, we were wondering- Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies? Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-I'm just a glorified extra, Fred. I'm a dead man anyway. If I'm going to die, I'd rather go out a hero than a coward. Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this... may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape. Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor! I don't like this... I don't like this at all... How do you remember this stuff? We're doing episode 31, Jason? I am SO SICK of being right. Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!... Something BAD happened here. Do I? DO I? For all you know I'm just "CREWMAN #6"! Okay, it's FLEEGMAN! Guy FLEEGMAN! There! Now I'm a whole person! I can't die! FLEEGMAN! THEY CAN'T KILL ME NOW, CAN THEY? CAN THEY? The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?... It's ... incredible. "Crewman #6"... Call me Guy. Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know. We~re oetting hammered, Jason. Return fIre? I know... You contruct a weapon. Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?... BECAUSE I DIED IN EPISODE 31! Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not? That's it, that's what's going to kill me. We're screwed... We're so screwed... No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me? Yeah, what is it? Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name? They're still behind us... ...Okay ~e're alive! We're alive! Not a clue. You? Where'd they go? Back inside? We're doing episode 31? More to the left... Stay parallel... Guy... You probably don't remember me do you? I was on the show in '82. Episode 31? Got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial? "Crewman #6?" Hi everybody.No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets- Okay... Let's go, buddy, they can take It from here... I'mo- ~hex! Alex, are you oKav? I had the shot...

At ease men. Calm down everybody. We're just here to negotiate General Sarris' surrender. COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR... Leadership.... I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty... "The show must go on." You WILL go out there. Come on, old friend... That's It? I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do? What? Up? Shit! Go! No, wait, are you- Okay, now. But- BRANDON! TIME TO GO! How did you come to that conclusion? But you don't? What do you mean? What does the Omega 13 do? Brandon.. Just in case I die, there's something I have to know... Yes...? We'd never have the budget for this. Okay... Okay, now what. Okay, we got it. Brandon.. . The crew and I are in trouble and we need your help. It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real. It's okay. Listen- Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you... What's your name, son? We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday. There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship Do you get it? It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand? Excuse me guys. Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred. Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this. Listen Fred. You did this for four years on the show. You can do it now... Put your hands on the controls.. I'll take my chances with Gorignak. The digital conveyer? You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces? Never mind, Fred.... I...Well, uh... Yes, absolutely. No. Keep all energy to the armor. A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.' It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?! It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion. Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we? All right, let's all settle down. If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control. It's... I don't know. Your last name. Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay? We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?... All right. Put me back on with him. TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT! Mark 12. Because it was on the show! Gwen... There's no hatch. There's no hatch! No I don't. But I know somebody who does. Right. What the hell are you talking about? Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard? What? What did he say? Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though... Yes. Yes, I'm here! Will you stop RIDING ME?! It helps. All right... here's the plan: First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere. Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter. Don't be ridiculous. Did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me? Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard? Can it be repaired? Are they behind us? Maybe we can lose them in that cloud. Listen, Sarris, you can't blame me for trying... I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.' You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay? We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right? All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly. Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here. Let me think. I need time to think. Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no! Hey... Hey where are you going? It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF... The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it. Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them. Tell them? About... C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck. But I'm the Commander! Let me try. Computer? Computer?... Oh come on, it's not like I haven't- It's Jason... This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?... You smiled at me. What do you want me to say, Gwen?... They wanted the Commander. A few fans built a little set in their garage. . I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing. Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy. We.. We lie. We pretend... My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors. Gwen. The show. There's no choice. Do it. Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything. No! I swear I don't know! Please! Stop, please! I don't know! I don't know. Yes. All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now. Just give me a moment to set it up. Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even... Right. Well... Listen, I'm I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding. I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh... ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that. Yes... Hi Sarris... How are you doing? Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer. You can oc that? It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain. Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations. It's all a fake. I'm not him... I'm a nothing. A nobody. A model, only as big as this. I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip. Well... Sort of... You what?.. What are you talking about? Mathesar? What is that? Mathesar, I need you to prepare pods for my crew. Former Commander? Then how did he find out about the device? Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records? Wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. Never give up, never surrender! It's perfectly safe. I promise. It was a lot of fun. You kids are great. Thanks I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00. But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call... Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels. Long live Theramini. Take a left here? Right. Long live... What's your planet? Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids. Home. Mind If we skip that? I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys. Oh, right! The thing with the thing. Come on in, I'll get some pants on. Catch me later, okay? Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these Hold course, Laredo! Mark 20 Into the black hole, areao. Let's do it, Tommy. Pedal to the metal Tommy... Practice driving, Tommy. All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on. Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time. We've got to get out of here. C'mon, hurry It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots! It doesn't have eyes. Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard. Okay... On what? Good work, Tommy. Let's go! Okay, let's go. Tommy, we have these... Anything. All right, Gwen, Alex, Fred, follow me. Guy, set up the perimeter. Tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back. Do your best, Tommy... Push It. Hold it down. Faster Tommy. Get us out of here! Just GO! GO! DAMMIT PUNCH GO! Well, it's... This was a device we... discovered on an alien planet. We don't know what it does either. They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant... I think we're going to exit the space port. Twenty third quadrant of gamma sector. I can show you on a map. That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps. And determination. I didn't say that. I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter. A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander? But...Why? But... Inside, I have seen- But there it is!... We have become aware of these concepts only recently. In our dealings with Sarris. Often Sarris will say one thing, and do another. Promise us mercy and deliver destruction... It is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost. But if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with Sarris. "Deception..." "Lies." We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship... A thousand apologies. We have failed you. It's the Tothian mine field left standing from the Great War of 12185. Commander... I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown. Our former Commander was not... Strong. NO, Thank God he has not. To our brave guests. Few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes. We are blessed to count ourselves among them. ... Maintenance facility... Weapons storage... How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people. An interstellar vox. He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of- But what if Sarris survives? Theramin. But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him. You... You mean Earth? Commander?... Where are you... going? As you wish. Commander... Welcome to the Protector II. Would you like to don your uniform? Sir, I understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, I beg you to hear our plea. We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula. Our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by Roth'h'ar Sarris of Fatu-Krey. Sarris wants the Omega 13. We are to meet in negotiation. However our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. The flames, the death... Please Captain, you are our last hope. We have secured a limousine. I... certainly, but- Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me. ... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you. LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning. I have been blessed. Sir, I... I... I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir... I'm... I'm shot. Sir! The pressure. It's normalizing. I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze. Where is everyone? Sir, it's you Thank Ipthar! Right... Sorry, sir. Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you- Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper. I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density. Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy. Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible... Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless. ...Yes sir. Your quarters sir. I'm sorry, sir, I was only- By Grabthar's Hammer, Dr. Lazarus, I- Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.You have a better plan, Alex? ...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps... Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit. You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second. You were holding it upside down weren't you? The engines are dead. We're drifting. They're drifting toward me... I think they're magnetic!... No, Jason, that's a wrap! There's nothing to think about! What the hell is going on?!!? Settle down, Alex... Not again... Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us? We made it. Commander, we made it.' We made It. Commander, we made it.' m ALEXANDER sort ov) By Grabtnar' s h~mmer, we ove to te ono 'tale. I think he just likes pointing at things. You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you? They're gone. Whatever, the one with the hologram. The wall of fire. "Assault on Voltareck III." Episode... 31 I think. Hey, YOU want to drive? Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh. I see them! I see them! Closer? I can try. JASON You think you could-get any closer to those mines? I heard it too. That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough. Face it, he's dead. I can't... It's on autopilot!... Sure, no problem. You know, that's really getting annoying. You should have let me hit him. That's it, It's go time. Almost as much as he loves himself. You are so full of shit Tomorrow morning, before the store opening. Where the hell is he? An hour and a half late. An hour and a half! I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal... Commander?... Call me Laredo? Pedal to the metal... Jason? What about me? What do I do? NO NO NO. The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots. Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with- How about the pig-lizard? Sorry Guys... It just went off. Oh, right, sorry. Okay, I'll do this... "Caw Caw!" What kind of signal? Oh god... Could be this. It's as far as it goes! Where? Why don't you just turn it on and see? Excuse me? What's going on? Wh... Where are we? ... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them- You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us! Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now! No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying? What the hell are you doing? End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so. Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared. Then what are you going to do? You're taking "no" for an answer? So, what are you going to do? You are a fanatic. An anarchist. You know that? If we can't have a whole show, then I want half a show rather than no show. But oh, no, not you. You won't be satisfied unless you're putting the company at risk! You're exaggerating! CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?! Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money? Yeah, I heard rumors. It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable. Lunch? I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.You got a deal. How long? Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...? You better take a good look! Because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious! Now, any of these guys been offered jobs in corporate security after they retire? Either one of those guys have ex-agent pals already in those jobs? Like, for instance, their ex-supervisor, who's already at Brown & Williamson as we fucking speak? Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier... Push the deadline, Charlie... These are their leads, their sources. I want you to have your reporters... Yeah. Catch you later. And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face? Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book. It's a smear campaign, Charlie. Push it. When's your deadline? P.J.'s. We gotta hook up. Well, are you or are you not, Charlie? Good. I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night... Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi... ...fuck is this? Fuck! Get me Wigand. Tell her I'll call her back in ten. When's the air date? Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself! Oh, for God's sake, what has this guy got, a horse fetish? Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses. Shit... Because he has to reveal it in a court of law. It's on record, it's out. It's no secret anymore. So how can they restrain his speech or retaliate? It's out in the world... What do you mean, what's it do? I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything. No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need? No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it. What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing. I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass... No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No. Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that. C'mon, what are you? And are you a businessman? Or are you a newsman?! Because that happens to be what Mike and I do for a living... I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets! No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear. Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer. It's not a rumor. It's a sale. If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not? Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"? "Tortious interference"? Sounds like a disease caught by a radio. Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world. "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive. I'm not implying. I'm quoting. More vested interests... "Persons Who Will Profit From This Merger... Ms. Helen Caperelli, General Counsel of CBS News, 3.9 million. Mr. Eric Kluster, President of CBS News, 1.4 million..." Before you go... No, I'm not... I'm not touching my film... So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap? Catch ya' later. I'm gonna do a follow-up. Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News? Debbie... Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story? Is this "Alice in Wonderland"? Come again? Well, as a "standard"... I'll hang with "is the guy telling the truth?" His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi. No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him... What does that mean? "Rife with -- ?" Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview. How prominent? What kind of placement? Catch you later. How are you, Jim? Did I tell you you were wrong? You ready...? Why? Yeah? Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong. Jim, it's Lowell. Yes. Yeah. No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"... My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm -- Thank you, Bob. From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures. I got perspective. Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press. "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it. Jeffrey... I'm alone on this... They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone. They're killing the Wigand interview... ...it's anonymous. References to "P.M." It's got to be Philip Morris, huh? ..."ignition propensity?" ...you understand any of this...? Let me see this... No, 'cause I gotta know where you're going at all times. Will independent sources corroborate that? Will he go on-camera and talk about the Mexico City branch? Let me call you back... Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?" Jeff! Wake the fuck up! Everybody is on the line here. If they can catch you in a lie, they can paint everything with that brush. Do you understand? Everything you say! Oh, my God. No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place? Who is this? Yeah... ...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick... Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it? Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point. Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection. Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there. ...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not? Area code 212-555-0199. Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line? I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe? Everything interests me. Mike... in my... Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here? No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it? Oh, please, Mike... I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver. But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why? Oh, lots. No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face. I think it was a disgrace. I disappeared on you? Yeah. I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air? I've been banished. In lieu of being fired. What? These people are putting our whole reason for doing what we do... on the line! "Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break! I discovered this. SEC filing... For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation. I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it. It went great in Mississippi, Mike. Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency? Oh, man. Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order... So, is everything okay? We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained. What if he were "compelled"? Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way... What's this? Hardly new news. The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... Referred to this... Said they should be afraid of him... I assume, afraid of what he could reveal. Now, you tell me. What does this guy have to say that threatens these people? He referred to this... the Seven Dwarfs... Yeah. ...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi... Don't interpret that! Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!! Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace? We're there. That's good. That works. Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but... No. We don't do that. You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike Wallace. So you know our reputation for integrity and objectivity. You also know we are the highest-rated, most-respected, TV-magazine news show in America. Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face. That's why. What I've seen... I've liked. Yeah... Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, I will. I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation. Jeffrey, where you going with this? So where you goin'? You are important to a lot of people, Jeffrey. You think about that. You think about them. I fought for you... and I still fight for you. I greased the rails for a guy who wanted to say yes. I helped him to say yes. Alright. You're not a robot, Jeff! That's all. You got a mind of your own, don't you? That's bullshit, Jeff! And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs. I am trying to protect you, man! That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...? That's not the point. That's the whole point, Jeffrey. That's the whole point. Anyone's. Everyone's. They are gonna look under every rock, dig up every flaw, every mistake you've ever made. They are going to distort and exaggerate everything you've ever done, man. Don't you understand? ABC Telemarketing Company. Alright... the ABC Telemarketing Company? Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...? Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics? She sued you for back payments of child support? Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me. Oh, you know what we do or do not need to know? Since when have you become a media expert? No? No, what? B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block... But you, I mean, I know how... I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it. Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side... You mean... since this morning? I heard about the Kentucky gag order... You attract a crowd. I know. I'm going to go there tonight... I heard. ...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company. Liane, this is a preliminary... You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for? Good. But Jeff... Jeff... Jeff, call the FBI right away... Excuse me. Yeah... Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action. No, don't evade a choice you gotta make be questioning my reputation or "60 Minutes'" with this cheap skepticism! Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source! Yes. I believe that? Yes, I believe that. You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have. You believe that? ...to a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important. I'm not pushing you around! I'm asking you questions. They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand? Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired. You charge by the hour? My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father? Marcuse. Yeah. He was my mentor. He had a major influence on the New Left in the late '60s... and on me, personally. What did you get us? It's okay. Hello. You there It's obvious, isn't it? Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use? Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car. You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway. How are your kids handling the new house? You okay? Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco. You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else. What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place? ...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease... Seven dwarfs? I don't know... you think the Knicks are gonna make it through the semi- finals? Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson? Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement? They're afraid of you, aren't they? No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell. But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people. And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it? How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson? Why am I gonna mention your name? To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now. I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone! C'mere. I want to talk to you. I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember? Mrs. Wigand, how do you do? What are you talking about? Where are you? If you want to do it. That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand. Did work. Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously. Where do you work? Far as you go where? Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way. Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...? How do you like your coffee? Black? That's room service. They usually knock first. Come on in... Over here, please. No, you can. Tell him to get on the fucking phone! Alright, now listen to me. I want you -- I want you to tell him, in these words: get on the fucking phone...! What's happening?! Hello, can you hear me now? What about now? Did he hear you? No, no. Don't call the police! Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that."Mike?" How grave? No, no, we're fine... C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end... That Canada story? Still interest you? You and I have been doing this together for fourteen years. I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?" What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone. In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations... Give me a break! Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way. I see a rhetorical question on the horizon. Yeah, that's right. How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many? Did I get you up? Alright. What did you think? You disappeared on me. How long you staying? Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio. That decision I've already made. I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night... I'm with Don on this. Lowell! Lowell. Lowell. What? After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show. Anything else? Good. Who are these people? Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal... Thank you for saying that... How are the rooms? Comfortable? Oh, torture? Great ratings. What do you mean? No shit. Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"... What "Seven Dwarfs?" Bring a tie so they'll let us in the front door... You eating with us? Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language. "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?" "The former executive has reason to bet on being sued, for major cigarette manufacturers..." And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle? And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you? In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously... And you sent the document forward to Sandefur? You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia... A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix... And that's what cigarettes are for...? All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing. You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?I can't say that! He doesn't seem to be listening... What? You're breaking up. I can't hear you. I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...Where? Did you see somebody or did you hear them? Hey, baby. What's wrong? Instant rice...? Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in." ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you? Here we go. Deep breaths, deep breaths. Sweetheart, c'mon. C'mon. That's great... Little early for cartoons, isn't it? Yeah? What for? What's new? Hi, honey. That computer has everything... ...my files! Personal correspondence... You can't take that... It's personal property...! Yes. Yes, I do. Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...! Yes, I do. A .38 Target Master. In my gun safe downstairs. A .45 Gold Cup. A .22 target pistol. So what? You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...? What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? What caliber is my gun? A gun? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid I did. Can we talk about this when I get back? What's the difference... Where should I wash them? I'm doing an interview. What's going on? There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage... Sure you don't need anything? Thomas Sandefur... I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it? I didn't want to leave it there... That's my stuff from the office... Soy sauce... I'm going to the store. You need anything? Try the car. Is there any more rice...? I can take her. You try and have a good time. Where are you, anyway? You fought for me...?! ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life! "Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around. You greased the rails! You manipulated me into this...! I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class. I told the truth... I told the truth. What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable! What does this have to do with my testimony? A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk. You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes? Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...? ABC...? What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay? What? She did not sue me. We had a dispute over money... I settled it, she dropped the complaint... Any other questions? ...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way... I told the truth! What do you want to do, Lowell, look up my ass, too...! I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes... ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day. No. What?! "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..." No. I mean since whenever... What's changed? I don't know what to do. Yeah, great. Did you have a good day? I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition... I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi... Lowell, I can't afford -- ...to talk about it. To think about it. I had a plan to ease her into it. But, I really -- I didn't know how to do that... I'll call them, Lowell. They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it. They do this with impunity! They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?! I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words! I don't think you really understand -- Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone! You believe that because you get information out to people... something happens? You believe that? No. I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials... I drink. A couple of occasions more than I should have. I was cited for shoplifting once. But it was a mistake... I pushed Liane one time. We were both stressed out because of the pressure. She went to her mother's. I got fired because when I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself. And I don't like to be pushed around! Why? My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew. Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions? Next to your father? The internet said you did graduate work in Wisconsin, then went to UC La Jolla with Professor... Marcus? Tempura... Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up. How'd you know that, Lowell? ...okay. No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about? Good. You have kids? The new place? New. I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it. I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial. Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house. I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...? It was on C-SPAN. Yeah. The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television... Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related. What else? Outside the "zone"...? Like what? They should be. And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage. ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it. You came all the way down here to tell me that? It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences! How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...? So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me? This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have? What do... Good. I want to talk to you. Jump in, quick, c'mon... Fuck you, too! ...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out! Should I just take the documents now? How much would I get paid? Did work. Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman? This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else. ...but that's as far as I go... How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS? I know what I have to know. Like what? Your sign? Look, I really don't have that much time... Black, black... Who's that? Our favorite hotel, honey... I checked into Room 930. Odd choice? Huh? And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week... Liane has filed for divorce... There is -- there is no family. Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now! Someone put a bullet in my mailbox. Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all. You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry. So, what were you calling about? I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know. I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game. Hold on a minute, Lowell... ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property... She's okay. For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people. Not like the Seven Dwarfs... "There are times... I wish I hadn't done it. But there are times that I feel compelled to do it..." "I've -- if you asked me if I would do it again or if it's -- do I think it's worth it. Yeah. I think it's worth it." "I would bet on it." Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it. Poor communication skills. Most certainly. I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision. The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen... The process is known as "impact boosting..." While not spiking nicotine, they clearly manipulate it. There's extensive use of this technology, know as "ammonia chemistry." It allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system. You're gonna get your fix... A delivery device for nicotine. Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly misstated, at least within Brown & Williamson's representation, clearly misstated... what is common language within the company... we are in the nicotine delivery business. ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully. How does one... "go... to... jail?" What does my family do? Go on welfare? If my wife has to work? Who's going to look after the kids? Put food on the table? My children need me. If I'm not teaching... there's no medical... no medical... even on co- pay, that's like... Tuition... Jail? When should we do this? Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call... Okay. I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't. "Research..." You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil... You threatening my family, now, too? Is that a threat? Chapter and verse. I'd rather play than talk about it. What did you want to see me about? I don't like being back here. Seven...Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me -- Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to... ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for... Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here. And the experiment is in here? -- Which I don't necessarily agree. -- I find it degrading. Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on -- What exactly is it supposed to do? Should I open it now? What is it? You are so mean. I was... never satisfied. We got divorced. I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me. Go to hell. I never said that. No? I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life -- You find it distasteful, don't you? Why? I'm paying for this. What? -- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew -- Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you -- Why not? I have eighteen more minutes!You're the doctor, what do you think? She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry. No... I mean about Althea. About her... ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up? Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. So what do you think? We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc? Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now. Althea hasn't told you? Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now. I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well." Are you a man who likes to treat himself right? I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars? Sorry I'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. Have another drink, I'll be back in five. You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.You can go out there if you like... Take your time. Doubtful. What did he say? You must have been concerned. What happened? One hundred books? Uh-huh. What are they? I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about. Really? You think so? Hmm? Good kids. How did they threaten you? I'm not sure. But I think they're worried about you. Me more than most. A friend? No. It's sort of spur of the moment. Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around? Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change. Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon. Why's that? No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it. Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. What's that? Uh-huh. Mr. Cook. Not any more. No, not really. I'm fine. Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that. What's that? I see. What kind of doubts? How do you mean? My approach? Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak. My mentor was an amazing teacher named Benton Mandlebaum. Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo. Are we? Right now? Of course... I've heard great things about you. Dr. Delbanco. It's nice to see you again. I feel like we're making real progress here. My pleasure. There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have -- My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment. But you did come to me. -- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way -- You remember when I asked you about pornography -- Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help. It's a thought I had. What's that? Now we're back on track. What?! I didn't hear you. Where's your wife, Henry? You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip. You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination. It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters. Not for this. Not me, you're not. Stop now. Henry! Mr. Follett. Good, then go. Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? I don't want to hear any more today. What brought this on? Mr. Gilroy -- Do you want to come in? I didn't see you there. Can I help you? She seems very unhappy. What do you think's wrong with her? Tastes good. A little. You've done well. We've been talking about her, mostly. What do you do? I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office." I've had my moments. Nope. Doc. Nice to meet you. No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry. I'm sorry you're frustrated. I'm sorry, your honor. Yes. Yes, your honor. I do. What it might take is... doing time. That's it? That's what you're giving me? Okay. Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything. You would have met in some shower eventually... He told you. Lily. ...so rich? Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. Where am I supposed to eat? Why do you watch? ...And? Horror show. What'd you do tonight? It's a pretty piece of land. How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily. You like me. How come? Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man. Lily, I don't think even you could know that -- Oh, I don't know... What do you want to know? It was Henry Follett. Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily? My patient had to leave early. Thanks for your help, Lionel. You're right, as usual. See you. Hello, Lionel. And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope. Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea? See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here. Sure I can, Lionel. -- Go on! -- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here. How are you? Martin. Is she a friend of yours? I'm trying. That would explain it. You're good. Don't need it. Sure. Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that. Could I see Sofie, please? Good evening, Mrs. Cook. Wow. You're something. Well... you see, the problem is -- Why don't you tell me? No, I really don't. What do you mean? There's something I think we need to talk about. That's right, the fake kind. Ph.D., psychologist. Will you be here? Will you wait for me? Anything... just ask. I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life. Will you think about it? But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off. I know it! Please believe me, I know that... But... Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here. You're not the only one... You probably got the idea. Sofie... I guess you saw the show...? What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook? Hello. Transference. What was that? I think so. Okay... I don't follow you. I'm glad. Um-huh. Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? Is it something you've heard about me? You're upset. Is something wrong, Sofie? Of course. Of course. I don't know if -- That's... good? Yeah? I thought only action movies had villains like that. That's one way to put it. I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't. Either one. That's what I like. Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone. Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning. You like it? In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why? Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door. Is that when you split up? It's pretty obvious to a trained professional. Disgusting. Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter. Yes. It doesn't matter. Go on. You're doing great. Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric. There... I've given myself a real whopper. All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... Like I'll think -- 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better.' But then I'll also think -- 'Mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.' I can give myself a headache instantly. So the headaches may not even be a part of this? Did you get headaches before this? But you get more now? Or more severe? Life. Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here. Painful lymph glands? Forget fulness... irritability... depression? Sore throat? Be specific. Sorry... I'm done. Really? What would it take? I've offended you! Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? Just kidding. Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right? Please... forgive me. Something's bothering her. Is she against you getting help? Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging. People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. We'll turn back anytime you want. Maybe you'll catch it. No one ever thought so. You must bring it out. We'll work it out. We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it. I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking. We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot. I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that. Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out. Hmm. Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind? No. What? When did you start to feel this way? What can you tell me about this? Feel free to lie down. Most people do. He agreed? Really? No again? What did he want you to do? What'd he say? Do you think that's what he wants? Uh-huh. True. Should we stop them? Was it something that happened at school? What happened today? If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay. What do you want me to see? That's not quite what I said -- You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa? Where was this? It's my bit for the community. It's called pro bono. It's a big part of the show. Why do you think you tell me, Nessa? Weekly or monthly? What do you mean, "in no time"? Yep. What? Yes, yes it does... Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients? Wow. Lily... ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily. What'd I do? Really? There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday. Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden. Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice. You're completely reliable. I'm honored. See you Thursday... regular time. I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do. Mainly, I listen. English Lit. No... no training. Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased. Oh. You got it backwards. I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle. When I saw this town on a map, I thought maybe it was a sign. See... What about it? All new people start with that... You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product. Who'd you go with? That's not good. That'd be Lily. Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert... Things got a lot worse. But look at me now... "Get to know your therapist." Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife. Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS. It wasn't the best situation. What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy... ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs. Everybody has a story, Skip. But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator. I can tell you anything else. Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc. Just you. Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two. Skip, that's not much of a secret. Definitely. Sounds like kind of a good idea. And that's your secret? You meant -- like a trade secret? How's it coming? A doll? Slash what? Jerking off? Okay... let's say that, for now. You are Panda, monarch of modems. -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret. It's just a thought. Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves. Yep. That's all right. What's on your mind? Hey, Skip. Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her. Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character. Yeah. Guy's got some serious sex fantasies. This -- What kind of person do you have to be to do this? Amazing. Well, there's Lily. Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge. She's probably ten years older than you. Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop? Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like. So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely? Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you? Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with. I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes. Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got. I understand. Is that the question? Have you thought about getting a wife? Can I ask you a personal question? Nah... scotch. No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from? How are you? I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little. I don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport. Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg. Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks. Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place. It's possible. I don't know about that. Why don't I call you when I've got my calendar in front of me? Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.Yeah. Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise. What are they? That's a lot of people all at once. So, is this like a Japanese restaurant? What? Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower. Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house... Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess. Doc!... It's not me, is it? I guess that makes sense. I'm here for you, Doc. Sorry... Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked. Lily. It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest. It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up. This doesn't seem a little... perverse? Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted? You want my advice? Far out! Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty -- Why me? How did you know you could trust me? I've never brought anyone down here before. Where ya going? I've got a million questions. Jeez, man. But you're good at it! Psych major? But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree? And a birth certificate is enough? "Mumford"... I mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to? I know it starts with a birth certificate... How'd you do it? The new you. I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day. Somebody's taking a shower down there. And the drugs? You and Candy...? At least you pulled yourself out... Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career -- You were messed up, man. Holy shit! Did you carry a gun? An IRS investigator with a drug problem? Sounds like you have several. -- an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service? Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was -- What about everything? How did this happen? I've told you a lot of private stuff. It matters to me. Damn! What is your name? It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it? Who else knows? It's not? Really? No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? You don't think I'm insane? No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies. Sexual surrogate... slash... companion. No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion. Guess. Go ahead, guess! It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour? That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me. All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can. And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us? Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines. Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever. And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of -- Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you -- I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you? Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something... You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything? I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got. How many sessions have we had now, Doc? Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit. Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday... I wondered what happened to her... Uh-huh. So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist. What? Unbelievable... ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out. Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the bigs? Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix. Good-looking woman. No... I've seen her. Good-looking woman. Okay then. Have you got a lot of friends? Don't you like this? Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me. You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think. This is exactly what I wanted. This is great! No, no... I have three billion dollars. I've got three big ones. I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got? I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor. You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? Far out. I gotta pee. Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0... ...thirteen! Right? Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too. Of course! That's exactly what I want. Far out. Single malt? Can I pick it? Would you like another beer? Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days. ..."Find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off. Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you. You're Doc Mumford. Skip Skipperton.Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life. He needs the book... And your sister. The book! The black book they found at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back. Said to me it would be worth it's weight in diamonds. You shall see. It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune. What friend? You're my only friend. Do you know where I can steal some? He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible. The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid. This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris. You left me! You left me in the desert to rot. Why do you like to fight so much? Just looking for you, O'Connell! I wanted to be with my friend! Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good. Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses! O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this! Even? You always did have more balls than brains. Unfortunately no, these Americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when I get them back to Cairo, so I must go all the way. You never were any good with the ladies, O'Connell. My very good friend! What a surprise. Then what the hell are you doing here!? What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping! Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody? I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them? In the desert? What for? Personally, I would like to surrender. Why can we not just surrender? Yeah! Them. ...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach? Yeah? All I remember is him turning into a blast of sand,... and then I remember nothing. Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?Did you say 'kill' my sister? Excuse me? Oh yes, of course. And how does one do that? And what ritual would that be? You're not going to kill us? Yes,... I see. Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here? Oh. What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!? I found it, Evy! I found it Juicy? Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there. Did you ever see him eat? Still... And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep -- No offense. Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going? Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word. Way to go, Evy. Picked his pocket, actually. That just makes you more gullible. I lie to everybody, what makes you so special? I was mistaken. Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes. Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much. Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich? Yes? Oh yes I do! I have something right here! My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note. Right now, I only wish to join them. Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original. You have got to be joking? He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon. I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it. What? And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back And then he'll be coming after Evy. Yes, I know, I do that to people. That looked rather painful. Who's here!? Did you see that!? Grasshoppers! Billions of grasshoppers! He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him. You did not!?... We're not!? What are you going to do? Shoot him? Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we? Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out. OWCH! That's really got to hurt. We'll sneak up and steal that book right out from under them. And it stinks to high heaven in here. That thing gives me the creeps. Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it? I can't believe the price of these fleabags. Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we could use another good player. Um, well, you see... She's my sister, actually.Well, okay then. I never killed a priest before. Who the hell are these guys? You know where he's taking her? Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath? Relax, I got him. What does he want the book for? What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat. Immune from what? Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you? Where's your new friend? Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples. Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we? Oh, hey, how ya doin'? Oh yeah,... sorry bout that. So who's this guy? Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to? 'Cause I look good doin, it. C'mon, friend. Goin' somewhere? I've had worse. Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river! Sounds familiar. Let's make us even, shall we? The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble. So you're the one leading the Americans, I shoulda figured. So what's the scam? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot? Why if it ain't my little buddy, Beni. I oughta kill you. None of the above, thank you. Altar boys? How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways? Now go find me a big stick. Shut-up and gimme your bandolier. Don't tell me we gotta go back out there? You think it'll send this guy back to hell? So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold -- Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's afraid of cats, what's that about? Try me. I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here. Got guts, lady. Don't do it, Evelyn. Got what? Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face? What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech. He's here! I saw him! That thing is here! FINE. You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot. Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated. Yeah? So? Is that my problem? There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here! We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing. Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone. You sure you outta be playin, around with that? The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues. That bad huh? Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy, and they slowly ate him alive? Is he supposed to look like that? You dream about dead guys? Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had. Because that's my name. Not unless you call me Rick. No you're not. And what is that? Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here? Something like that. Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew. You don't believe in curses, huh? Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid. Some sort of ancient booby-trap. Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed. Who was talking about what? There's some sort of lock here. You say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior? Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling? Yeah, that'd bring you back to life. Preparation for what? What are those mirrors for? The things that get you excited. We're about to be shown the way. We're almost there. Trust me. Can you swim? Relax! I'm the map! It's all up here. I know my treasure. And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right? Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell." There's something out there, you know, something under that sand. The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died. Still angry that I kissed ya, huh? Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya. Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- ! Really want to know? Want to know? I found sand. I saw death. -- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead. Every damn day. Yeah, I was there. I just decked your brother Because that's where I found it. I was there. No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra. No. So who's the broad? Do something, Jonathan! Kill it! Got it. Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like? We gotta get her back. What? Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life. Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go. Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap. The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY! That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague! Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter. Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer. If he decides to wake up, hell yes! Where's my gun? Tough break. No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing, Lemme get this straight, they stuck a sharp, red hot poker up your nose, cut your brain into small pieces, then ripped it all out through your nostrils? And you're sure you can find the secret compartment? None taken. You're welcome to my share of the spider webs. Be nice. That thing saved my life. Awfully. We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister. I only gamble with my life, never my money. Hey,... don't I know you? Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.It doesn't matter what we call ourselves. We know who we are. Sure. Hello? I dunno. Casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it. Half a Dirty Dozen! Hey... Can I buy you a beer? They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME! Frankenstein! So are you! Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on. Against. And the nuts always call themselves great. You're nuts. What did you do with Captain Amazing? Monica! What? And what if you get killed? He's a psycho! He'll kill you! What are you talking about? Are you nuts? Get out of there! Monica, where are you? I just want to be a superhero. Me, too. What have they got that we ain't got? It's home. Roy. Nothing wrong with being a waitress. I wouldn't mind being famous. It is? Why? Sure. Yeah. Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a... Every night. Hi. Or talk? Only when I'm awake... You busy after work? Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say! Good or evil, what's the difference? Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview -- So how do you know that you've ever been invisible? If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again. So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible. We're all the same really. Our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever. And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget! Maybe. But this isn't about living or dying. It's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a little funny... Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios, muchachos! My heart died a long time ago. When are you going to take off that mask? And a skunk stinks! But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows! You're the Sphinx. Cover me! I'll drive. But she still might call! Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved. But I just don't feel it. Because that's what it is. So what else has Superman got? SO WHAT? You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF! I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure. But we know they're out there. Hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause... You sure that's how you spell it? Good point. Have you ever seen him? I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know! Yeah yeah -- and that, too. What have the famous superheroes got that we don't? We had an off night, that's all. LOOK! Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it? Come on. He hasn't stolen it yet. Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey! Oh shut up. Who are we kidding? No one's gonna show. We're living in a fantasy! Sounds good. Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night! Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes! Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for! Shhh. Well they've crawled back out. The who? Let's go. I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out! See ya tomorrow. Like what? Cutting off my own ear? Who's chicken? What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it! And then they dump you. Nah. Why not? So why don't you just tell her! Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein! A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY! He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him! What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil. I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance? I just know. Yes. Yes. Hey... he's gone. Anybody got any? The Obliterators! Yes. No. Yes.But that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is -- Let's do it. No one will believe us. Me, too. But in fact... you'd found it. The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand. I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law. I can't. The Inscrutable Six? But they all had one thing we haven't got. And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway. Who are you? He's turned into a completely normal person! What's that? So where's the art? Roy -- Roy, remember, it is all within your power. The only thing that's in your way... is you. Maybe there was traffic. No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station. But there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal. Agents? Maybe she's right. I'm soaked. Oh great. The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork. Wait!... Look! But we don't know for sure it's the same guy. Or flowers. Maybe you should try a more romantic approach. So you're chicken? Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date? Because I can't! Okay? She wouldn't understand! I can't. I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it. But look at him... and look at us. There's a vague similarity. He doesn't miss a trick, does he? Yes, Obie-wan. Firepower costs money. The Eradicators! So you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you? So you're only invisible... to yourself? But... only when no one is looking. Ow. Burgers all around. Medium. Rare. Raw. Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional. And these are my associates, the Shoveler. We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... Not yet. We're superheroes. You did? It is? I use it... to fight evil. Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am! Because... I'M A SUPERHERO! Mother... it's not what you think! Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy. Looking for... the TV Guide. Oh hi, Mom. Through there! May the forks be with us! With or without him, we gotta go! Oh no. We're outnumbered twenty to one. That was too close. But how do we get in? He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing. Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king. But, Doc... where's the machine guns? Are you sure he's still alive? Whatever our name is. And a social life. He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete. And there's the Sphinx. Do we have to? Shut up. Be a Mohican. Don't crunch the leaves. Or both. This looks like a job for Superman -- The Disco Boys. This is bad. Ask her out. She likes you. And Mister Furious... His anger is his power. We take the licks and he gets the chicks.Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People. Atta, girl! Come on, baby! And some sandwiches -- Then Captain Amazing appeared. When was that? We didn't think this through very well. So who killed him? Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing. The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago. With what? Not a chance! Are you coming or not? Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! GET MAD! This place is built like a fortress. He's got the fact that he's Superman! But there's still only six of us. There's a big difference. There's just not enough of us. Yeah. How could I see him if he's invisible? I'm liking this. And it would be the right thing to do. What are you talking about? So when are we gonna have an on night? Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours. Oh don't start that again -- Right. Where am I going? We've got lift off! It's time. Great timing! It's suicide. But we gotta find out what's going on in there. Maybe it's time we checked that place out. And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since. Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home. The bazookas? Are you sure he's still lives here? To us! Yeah, but how do we get to them? The who? I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible. Be a Mohican. Sorry. Or Batman -- We may be getting in over our heads here. Who are they? Definitely. Hi. How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen? Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?That's right. And making me was the biggest mistake you ever made! Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started -- You mean besides kicking your ass?! The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary! Oh no. You're not like me. In fact, I'm betting you're the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you always were. Ain't it. I should kill you right now for what you did to me! You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else. You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant. Wow, that is one moving story. Take it easy on my heart strings. Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison. I can explain it. Attempted murder wasn't enough for him. He wants to add kidnapping to the charges. Here, kid, this is great stuff. Why don't you give it a try? You have no idea what this is doing to your body. You don't want this. I'll do whatever I have to do. Oh no, no, no. No can do. You enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and I don't care if it's a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez! You've got to learn to take responsibility! I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug. What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'? What is it with you litterbugs? Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage? Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs. So what? So what? For starters, how about littering is a crime. I guess they do. We were different people then. I remember I was trying to help... I have to! We don't have time to argue, Susan. What would happen if I threw him into the core? That means the nanobot is still inside him. You mean he's polymerized, like me? We've got to get the nanobot. What in the...? Susie... I... You saved my life. I'm not leaving without you, Susan! Let's go. Where is it? What could happen? I'm the plastic man, remember? You didn't think I could just leave you? I can't go back to jail. I gotta get out of here. The head shrinker at the prison. On the counter. You made this out of my hair? That's going to fit me? What's that? Getting used to it. No cheese. I could go with you. What did you want my hair for? I don't know. It's still inside me? What's wrong? Uh oh. I remember that temper. Do you have something to bring me down? I feel very emotional right now. A bit out of control. I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me. Yeah. Old times. And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl! But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate! I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress! This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists? Blame the victim. Just giving credit where credit is due. Means? Oh no. We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein! Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in. Just look at it! Look at this! Susan! No, no, I just feel wired! No, why? You're the doctor. Isn't it already too late then? So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab? What do these replicators do to people? That was an egg? What happens? The waste. Got it. That was 'simple'? What waste? Why do we need it? Pills... you know how I feel about pills. Why? What are these? We don't? I'm a plastic man! A plastic man! Oh God, please! This can't be happening! I can't be plastic! A plastic man?! Oh no, no, no! You've got to be able to fix me! Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again! Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure. But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have. You don't know? What happened to it? Mouse? What mouse? They did it to me! No, something is really wrong... look! Please, Susan! I need help! Something is wrong with me! Susie! You gotta help me! Susan, this is the future of America here. Am I? Look! Right there! That's exactly what I am talking about. You think it's a coincidence that they have all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We're all lab rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency. All the while they're everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras, nodding to each other, making little notes. I can't help it, Suze. It's this place. You know how I get in these stores. They freak me out. All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what. All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in! Money! You think the chemists that invented Agent Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, 'Boy, I really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.' You think Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war? We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange. Yeah, we'll see. That's what I thought. Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You haven't published anything in a while. How come? Yeah. Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie? Right. You predicted it. I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells. I remember you said, nanotechnology was going to change the world. I've been thinking about you a lot all these years, locked up in my cell. I'd tear through every issue of the Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly. Exciting stuff. I got to tell you, it really kept me going. A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men. The big house. Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does things to a man. Oh no. Not by a long shot. I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same. Somebody has to. You know, this and that. Been out for six months now. What? No kiss? Not even for old times sake? The question is, are you? All the different ways that I could kill you. An ass-beating. Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim? Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you. This is wonderfully accommodating of you all. Now I won't have to come looking for you. Forget it, pissboy! You tell Argon he can call my lawyer. I get it. You're the goon fetch boy. The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose. What? I'm not going anywhere! You! I remember you!So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard? Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property. I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done? In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed. Well, I wish you luck. It is a treacherous business. I see. And you are in California for what reason? The actor Who are you, sir? See what you can do about this CITIZEN KANE picture, won't you? Why is that, Louis? Oh, why is that? And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well. Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far? Mm. Not a very good picture I am told. Quite. And this is why I came to visit. Have you heard about this CITIZEN KANE picture? Hope you don't mind my popping in-- Louis There is nothing to understand but this: I am a man who could have been great, but was not. castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood-- No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous I will not have this in my home. You are slovenly and unattractive and I won't t-t-t-tolerate it. You are repellant when you drink. That's right. You've captured me exactly. Goodnight. Not for me. I wanted it You needn't use that language with me It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France. You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to-- There is nothing to discuss- We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it. I will not defend my life to you-- There's nothing to explain This picture-- Marion-- One . . . buys things. Yes. It's not really-- The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts. Nothing for you to worry about, darling He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture. The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today. She's a Catholic. She says it would put her soul in peril. Divorce is a very serious sin, apparently. Darling, I talked to Millicent. There's no call for that language- Good. Retain that feeling. Let it nourish you from this day forth. It shall nourish us both And how do you feel when you are lied to? Please be quiet. I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me. Why did we not know about this sooner? Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you. Thank you for your time Yes? How so?Yeah, you're probably right. Aw, cheer up, George'll probably be running Fox by the morning. Let's get a drink. Shit Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors. Hell, I know how it ends. Hey, Rosebud's the sled! This ain't George's doing--! Kinda. I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on. They won't let it out. Not Hearst. Not the other studio heads-- If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already. Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out. Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake-- This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews. Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating. Jews. She's talking about Jews. No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about? "And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?" No, you gotta hear this- Hey, kid. Gregg. I don't give a shit about- I don't care. Fuck you. You wanted me out. I'm out. Uh huh. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?! I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this-- Craig is one syllable Cain -- like the Bible guy? The title? What? It's good, huh? Yeah, but the margins are real wide. And when he looks up? What does he dream about? And what does he see? They don't have to. She was . . . innocent This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her. Like a jewel. Turn it in the light and a different facet is illuminated. Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show. He'll destroy us. I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me-- And yeah, sure, Hearst's a great subject. Been keeping notes on him for years for my ... great American novel. But I can't do it anymore. No studio's gonna hire me and I - - When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me-- I don't have it anymore?! Fuck you-- Let me out. Don't do this Don't do this Sorry to disappoint. Fuck you You may think you know what you're talking about, kid, but believe me, you don't. You're talking about going into a battle you can never win on a battlefield so far above things like movies and Hollywood that Hearst won't even have to glance down when he crushes you. When he flicks you away with one finger. I'm talking about money and influence and evil beyond your capacity to imagine Hell. Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved. Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o? Power. Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine. Orson. Stop. Just stop Don't whisper it. Don't even think it Please don't say this. Oh Christ Oh Christ... This better be good Oh for Christ's sake- Okay, boy wonder, what? Orson, please ... it's too bright Yeah, it's the place God would have built, if he'd had the money. The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island. No, baby, those are the hands of a killer The old man has his own way of doing things I don't wanna write about no spic. Who the hell's Manolete? Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart. Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah I'm not fucking with Hughes. That shit-kicker would kill us dead, baby. Just like Jean Harlow Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness. Like a bug. Right- You're a laugh-riot, kid. Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history. Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola. Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde. Nope. What are movies about? What are movies about, Orson? But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that. I don't know what you expected with Joseph- fucking-Conrad for Chrissake. I mean this is Hollywood, pal. So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice. Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George. Oh God. Yeah, ain't it swell?Can I talk to Hearst? Oh for God's sake, Louella- Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out-- Hearst? He personally asked you to? That might be a tad difficult because Orson is scoring the picture now and he's very particular about the music-- No -- no -- I mean-- Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--? Herman. I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer And they went to the stockholders in New York. They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints. He truly doesn't care if he ever works again. Get out. Get out You talked to Mr. Swanbeck? You talked to New York? You're lying to me. You're going to destroy it To do what? Very generous Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning. It was the best, kid You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second. Oh God. . . Happy birthday. I think you better sit down The Palace in New York. But Orson there's something else. Hold on a sec. I got news. We finally found somewhere to premiere KANE but-- No, we're jake. But listen- You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you! This isn' t some kinda fucking game! You know how many people RKO employs?! You know how many people depend on what we do for a living?! Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster. Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?! "Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?! How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?! For Christ's sake, shut up-- Well it' s all you've got ! Listen to me. The press ban is killing us and the distributors won't book it. And meantime I'm dealing with the stockholders in New York who are scared shitless -- and I'm this far from getting fired myself -- and you don't have a friend in the world but me right now. So you have got to trust that I'll do what I can to-- You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture What do you want me to do, Orson? Radio City won't premiere the picture. Louella threatened them with some bullshit about And this is the evening edition. Notice anything? When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray. They've all seen a rough cut For the title It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that. Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE. Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS- Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that? Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this-- CITIZEN KANE There's your title. CITIZEN KANEThat poor woman. Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of-- Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born. Am I? I wonder sometimes. Not you too No, when I was but a tender lad-- Ever met Walter Winchell? Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master. Do you? I'll remember that. So I've been told. To make pictures. And director. My name is Orson Welles "A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own." You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him-- This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him! Then make them up! You're drunk and you're angry. Keep filming. "Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me." I am not doing Hearst. That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties-- Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons-- We're using- What we are going to do is shoot life -- in all it's joyous complexity. Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures? You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway. What have I done? George... Mank! You gonna watch? YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!? Is that from one of the Gospels? You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?! It's too late. The movie's made What?! Are they going to kill me? Is that what they're going to do?! What does this have to do with--? Christ. So they're Jews. . . Hedy Lamarr? Well, at least she's off KANE today No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back-- He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him. Did I ever tell you about my father? I'm sorry. I want you back I just can't . . see it anymore And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. ' Jesus Christ -- To my invaluable comrade Drink up! But it's not a great syllable K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that? Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name. Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . . It is 350 pages of ... ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION! It's 350 pages long. The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them. Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him. He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known. All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because-- Why her? The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now. How? So, who is he? We have to know him. Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I? NOT UNLESS I. TELL YOU IT IS I'll hire you -- right now- It doesn't have to be I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again! Listen to me- --Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -! Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years-- I remember a man who wrote I He was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight-- How does it feel, Mank? Going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table? How does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves--?! I expected more from you. So speaks the court jester. We're doing Hearst. Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from-- How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--! Mank- Yes. Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his-- Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal. I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast. Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence! Here you are, up with the birds for once, you vampire! Mank! You scoundrel! What took you so long?! Jesus "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate? Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio. He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress. The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous. No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth. Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains-- The great Spanish bullfighter Manolete?! Sigmund Freud? Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow? How about Howard Hughes? We could do Hughes But with compassion and insight-- We find the man and then we dissect him- So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography. That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history. Not for me. Magic Showing life Telling stories. Forget it- Nonsense All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone-- Again Again Again Again. Again. So, on to the Life Of Christ! It was fun, wasn't it? Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you? It's my birthday this week. I'll be 26. I don't want to sit I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back? Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story-- You're not still mad at me, I hope It was a -joke, George I really think you're That soulless monster gets no tears from me. It's just that my movie is so- Why don't you just have the guts to admit it You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you! "Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--! Then find another theater The ad.. The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?! This is an abomination There's no music and-- Ah, it's a grand title. Please don't ask me to do this. Jesus I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--! A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked-- Pardon? It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but-- Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West-- I'm Christ Yes! Yeah. How 'bout a real drink? Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up-- I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--! It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat-- Five...? Yes. No. We're done todayWhat? Really? Maybe. Don't go home, okay? I wish I were somewhere else. She came a long way to visit me, didn't she? What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody? You do? You believe now? Just help. No. You have nice red in your cheeks now. You really look better. What happened? We're not gonna start crying again, are we? Are you wigging out? Something happened, didn't it? You believe me, right? Dr. Crowe? You weren't a paper champion. Don't cry. Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it. Don't fail me. When? Why don't you think about it for a while? I told you what I want. What do you want more than anything? Can I ask you then? When they get mad, it gets cold. And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up? Cats? Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time. Did you think the play sucked big time? Will you stay here till I fall asleep? All the time. They're everywhere. You won't tell anyone my secret, right? No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead. Me too. Your eyes told me. You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas. You haven't told bedtime stories before? Dr. Crowe. Yes. I didn't know you were funny. You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time... That isn't magic. Something I want? Upset words. Words. What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it? She died a long time ago. Mr. Marschal gets real lonely. You said the "s" word. That I'm a freak. Cause she doesn't look at me like everybody and I don't want her to. I don't want her to know. I don't tell her a thing. He hates me. I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo. Look over there. Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her. Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism. You want to ask me a question? I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows. They don't have meetings about rainbows. Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying. I don't draw like that anymore. We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver. Next time I won't be scared of you. I'm going to see you again, right? That's good. Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt? You use needles? Congratulations. You're a doctor. What kind? I forgot your name. Nothing bad can happen in a church, right? What were they hiding from? No, just one. ...De profundis clamo ad te domine. They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes. She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance. She wanted me to tell you-- I know. Grandma comes to visit me sometimes. She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot. Got it. You think I'm a freak? What are you thinking, Momma? They want me to do things for them. Ghosts. Dead people. They scare me too sometimes. Standing next to my window. Yes. A lady. She died. Someone got hurt. You know that accident up there? Tell you my secrets. I'm ready to communicate with you now. Maybe. Don't get mad. Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved. You'd cry. Cause you miss grandma so much. Anything bad about me? What are you thinking, Momma? Oh. Stuttering-- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley! Stop looking at me. You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad. You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school! You're a stuttering Stanley! Stop it! I don't like people looking at me like that. They were the ones who hanged everybody. They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them. They used to hang people here.Goodnight, sweetheart. I just needed to do a couple of things. And I needed to tell you something. I didn't leave you. What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad? Are you calling me? --Do I know you? We can keep it in the bathroom. Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss? Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom. Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time. And you know what else? You were great in the play, Cole. I think we said everything we needed to say. Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you? I definitely won't. Where will you go, where no one has died? I guess she did. I don't think that's the way it works, Cole. I believe both of you now. And I think I might know how to make them go away. Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones... What do those ghosts want when they talk to you? Think real careful now, Cole... It's Spanish. It means... 'I don't want to die.' Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal? Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is? Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone... No, we're not. Yes, I am. Yes, it did. Yes. Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy. It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was... I was a fake. --What? I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional-- Soon. One week. I have to. I don't know, Cole. I don't know. Yes. Them? Yes? Never mind. I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats. What? ...No. How often do you see them? They don't know they're dead? Dead people, like in graves and coffins? I don't know how the story ends. I hope it's a happy ending. What makes you think that? No gas... Hey, that's good. No. Yes. Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep... When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on-- Your father ever tell you bedtime stories? I forgot myself. Who me? What? If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be? Think about what you want from our time together. What our goal should be? What kind of words? What'd you write? I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing. ...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth. What about Mrs. Marschal? Yeah. Sorry. Know what? Why? You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy? You hate him? He your best buddy? Where should I look then, Cole? You mean aneurysm. See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question. I guess they don't. How do you draw now? You saw that on T.V., Cole? And Cole, next time I won't be late for you. If it's okay with you? No. No. Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while. You're my very first client back. I got an award once. From the Mayor. I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out. Dr. Crowe. Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them. All your soldiers speak Latin? What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun. I knew there was a sound explanation. Your eye frames. They don't seem to have any lenses in them.--Shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak! S-ssssstop it! S-ssstop that! Who! How did you--? What-- Excuse me? I don't know how else to look-- Like what? Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers. That's not correct. Where'd you hear that? Yes, Cole?I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive. He's drowning me! Okay. Yes please! I hope it wasn't cheap. I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you. No it's for Tom as he didn't complain. Shut up. Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine. Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom. Marge, you like everybody. You'd say if you mind? It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh. Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come. It's great. You're going to love it. Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar. Did you speak to my father? Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. Uncanny! Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st. Everybody should have one talent. What's yours? Is that good? We? Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing. I just woke up. I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine. Sure. Any time. What are you doing in Mongi? What evening? You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring. I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while. Tom, I don't love you. I love Marge. How? Marge and I are getting married. Oh God, I don't think so. Really? To Italy? So tell me. So cool. I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums? Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit? I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I? Ripley's plans. That's good. To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight. I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip? I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we? You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever. She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault. What are you talking about? She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this? I don't know! Why are you asking me? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance? He's downstairs. Freddie drove me back in his car. Get undressed in your own room, would you? Shoes too? Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...? Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station. Freddie Miles. You know -- he's organizing the Cortina skiing trip. Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation. Relax. I love how responsible you are. My Dad should make you Chief Accountant or something. Let me buy you a jacket. There's a great place when we get to Rome, Batistoni. You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them. What does he say? Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway. No! Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean? Do you have any brothers? Well we certainly know that's true. It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it. I know. I write like a child. Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true? The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad. That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York? You're breaking my ribs! You're breaking my ribs! Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class? See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list. Sure. I love Venice. You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well. Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back. You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged? Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money? I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up. Good afternoon! Bird! Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -- This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz. You like jazz! Go back! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard. It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother. I'm never going back! What? Marge! You've got to hear this! I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him? Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up! What? What's this? That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression. Can you mix a martini? Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party. That's funny. Say again? Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually. Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it? Okay. And did we know each other? Who's this? Marge-maintenance. Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks. Do you think you can steer this thing? Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna. Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life. This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles. Frederico!Aye, aye. What are you doing? Sure. I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies... Dick -- you've got to hear this! Hey, if I'm late, think what her husband's saying! Ciao bello. Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once. Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you. What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else. Have you done something to your hair? In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you. Did this place come furnished? It doesn't look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? -- so bourgeois. No thanks. Some kid at the American Express Office. Are you living here? Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing? He can't. He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't get a cable or a call or a note or, frankly, a fart. Because he's been hiding from me -- what happened at Christmas? The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now. I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth. Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you? It's Freddie. Let me in. Dickie?What's funny? That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels. No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh? Where's Dickie's father? I think we sort of found each other. That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said -- Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie -- We think he's had a change of heart. So we should be celebrating. No, we're meeting another friend. Tom Ripley. Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...! Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie. They found this in Dickie's place in Rome. A ragione. A ragione. Are you a homosexual? Interesting non-sequitur. He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside. Where have you been since then? He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder. ...Tom is a mystery... Good things about Tom Ripley? Could take some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is tender... Tom is beautiful... And don't forget. I have the key. What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are. What do you mean lied about who you are? Really, why? Sorry, I'm completely lost. Or Tom and Peter even. Why lie? Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance. Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith. Was that Meredith? How was it? You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future? Hello. What are you up to? What do you want to change about this moment? Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on? Tom, are you okay? Or I could come back. Do you want me to stick around? Are you okay? Not guilty. You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay? No key, huh? Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building. But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody... Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...? He's already angry, I don't think -- He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf? He says so many fianc�es. Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate. No. By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient. I don't know how to translate that. E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un... A Roma, circa tre settimane fa. You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered -- That's good, isn't it? Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome. Welcome to Venice. This place reeks, doesn't it? Can you smell it? Ugh. Sorry. Not the best way to spend your first day. That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous. Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece? But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses... Not at all. Morning Tom. We'll be there. I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? And tomorrow? Will we see you later? Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice? Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around. Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play? The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious -- What? No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that. You love me and you're not marrying me. Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd. How? You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me. Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here -- I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. I wanted to tell you my plan. What? I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York... Ha. Then I'll take it as a compliment. Why? Why are you asking all of a sudden? Esatto. I'm always planning. I've got plans! I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back. To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life. What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least? I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers... ...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way... I'm not going to say anything -- to Marge, or anybody, the police -- It's a secret between us and I'll keep it. You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had. I'm prepared to take the blame. What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him? I was just fooling around. Don't say anything. Sorry. Is Freddie here? I thought you'd missed the train. You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry. I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you... What club? Freddie? It's just there's so much to do in a single day. Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ? I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money. He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving. I didn't mean with you in it. Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? No, no brothers, no sisters. Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity. Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain. Like Clark Kent. Now Superman. Now your signature. Not "Dickie". Your signature. No! I've got more than one shirt! Copy out from here... A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York. I played piano in a few places. What? And Rome. I have to go to Venice. Could we sail to Venice? I'm doing this wrong, aren't I? Your parents met her. This is so good of you. What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts. I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? I love jazz. I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I -- No, I think your mother, her illness -- I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000. Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back? I met him in New York. Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise. I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them. Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent -- The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance. Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody. Sure. I'm intruding. No, still here. You know, a primer. It's just an undercoat. Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through. Ripley. Hullo. How do you do. Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me. It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso. Freddie, do you have something to say? Hardly. You should watch that! No. No, I'm staying here for a few days, in Rome. That's a new piano, so you prob -- How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink? Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly. What about Christmas? He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you. I guess. Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it? Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley. Who is it? Hello? We could go down to the bar -- no need for you to -- You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday -- I clean forgot -- ridiculous. Hello, sir. Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up? I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you. I think it might hurt her to know. I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie. Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo? Yes it is. I'm well, thank you. Mr Greenleaf. I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir, but... Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir. Thanks, yes, I think we did. There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest. Thanks so much for inviting me tonight. I hope she never knows. Okay. I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it? Is Mr Greenleaf here? Oh Marge. What? I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise -- But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day. It's all true. I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you. I told you. He gave them to me. Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me. The scent you're wearing. I bought it for you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie. So many things. The day he was late back from Rome -- I tried to tell you this -- he was with another girl. I'm not talking about Meredith, another girl we met in a bar. He couldn't be faithful for five minutes. So when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. Or I do. He has so many realities, Dickie, and he believes them all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize. Marge? Where are you going? Shut up! Shut up! Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical. Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this. I can explain. What? Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long. He's having an early night. And you, sir? Any better? Look at me what? That's a terrific idea. I was looking forward to seeing him. Hello Marge! No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie. Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later. We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie -- Get on. I'll take you to him. My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. Are you getting on? Dickie did it. I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. Marge, when did you get here? Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great! I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to -- Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest. No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley. Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome? I think you're right. Search me. I guess we're abandoned. Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this. Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me. I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine. I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days. I was just looking at you -- so quiet. How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? Hello Marge. I'll go and see what's the matter. What about Cortina? So I'm learning. Sure. I'm fine. My fianc�e. I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me? It's superb. That ring's so great. The green one. I absolutely agree with Marge. He's not a man, he's a god. Bird. That's jazz. Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so. Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. You know what -- I am. I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later? They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me. I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer. I've thought about you. Of course. Aunt Joan. Just kidding. Are you alone? Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward. Hello Meredith. Exactly. 10.30 -- Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't... C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. Let's go. I'll take them both. I know. Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life. I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome. Is Freddie in Rome? How did you know that? What? Randall. As in the...? Emily. Just kidding. My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name. Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship. Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello. Excuse me? You're such a liar... You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things. Peter, I... I... I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody. I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me. Well that would be even better gossip. Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it? I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you. Hardly kissing. Kissing off. Was who Meredith? Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip. Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too. I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me. All kinds of things. Making plans. Nothing. Ask me what I want to change about this moment. I give up. You try. You try talking to her. It's okay. I'm fine. I'll fix some drinks. I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep. I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if... Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was... Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do. Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel. Just because he doesn't like Americans! No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me? Ask him if he's accusing me! What did he say? Tell him I have a fianc�e, Dickie has a fianc�e and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them. No. I've been backpacking. In Rome, about three weeks ago. I knew that one. It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe. No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the -- What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome? It's okay. What rumour? Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten. It's fantastic. I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand this, but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty. My God. Hi. Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost... Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long? Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you. Ten thirty? Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? I can't later. Thanks. I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north. Ditto. Tomorrow. Absolutely. No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni. I have! It is a little coarse, yes. I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. Thank you. Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in. No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later. 31 people. It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. No! A few days ago. I don't remember the exact date. Was it? Did you speak to Tom? Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago. What about Ripley? Even her. I really don't want to see anybody. The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address? My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by photographers. Can we go up? Do you mind? Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car. Postmortem? Yes, if it's going to help, certainly. I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. Yes?I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up. Tomorrow then? Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence. I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. You have, yes. Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San -- Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fianc�e? That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood. 31 people. No. Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead -- he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. Does he stay with you here? And when did you last see Signor Ripley? November 7th is my information. November, I thought. What about Thomas Ripley? Even your fianc�e...? Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fianc�e. Of course. What happened to your face? No. Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening. So, the Doctor, he has to make the -- -- come se dice? Senta. We have to ask you to stay in Rome. So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? Inspector Roverini. Can we come in? Dickie Greenleaf?Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school? You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee? Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan? Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog. Uh... Yeah, that's right. I do, baby, I do. Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you. Yeah, I'm the best, baby. No, no that's fine. So you doing okay? Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon. Back out? You don't need us to get laid. You afraid or something? My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question? Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww! Jesus, Kevin, rub it in. She's already on a plane back home. Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive. Holy shit. Please, God. Let this be it. Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no. Oh...oh...oh, shit! That's stupid. But, but -- what would I do? Did I miss anything?! Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch? I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation? Hey, where's Finch? Yeah, enormous. I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing suit. Exactly three weeks to the day. Yeah, it's like tradition or something. Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it! Pontificated. Like a bet? Sorry, I thought you were dead. But -- What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base. So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this? You can crash at Stifler's? No, "Charming" is old. "Older" is really old. "Youthful mind" is dead. There's our man. You think she was serious? And you said... Dad!! Dad. I know. Hey Nadia. Yes. Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about. It's not what it looks like! Thank you, dad, I got it. Yes dad. Dad! I know! I know, Dad. Okay. Dad, come in. Yeah, sure. Nothing! Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth! Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do? Why, uh, what makes you think that I -- This'll do. ...excuse me?! Okay, I get it. So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds? Yeah, bring it on! I told you. Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And... Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp. Stifler's mom got it in the divorce. Highly, highly overrated. Whatever you want. Yes. Seriously. Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom? What was your name again? Yeah, that's pretty much it. Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry? After getting laid? Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there. There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date. So do I, Kev. No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it. Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her. Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good. Hey, you did better than I did, Nova. Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade? So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like? Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim? This was remade? Into what? Ooh, here's an easy one: "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly. No -- Kevin, you? C-Span? A hot cartoon. Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land. Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew. You did it. You've got something going? Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes. No! I've got...reserve reserves! No, not again. Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me very much. But not as arousing as you. Did you see this? This is your more exotic dirty magazine. No, no, I'm not done! I've got reserves! Nadia, please please please. I'm begging you. Oh no. Nadia, I can't -- Um...okay... Uh... You mean like, strip strip? Strip? Uh...yeah...sorry. Well...uh... So you need to change, right? I suppose that would be okay. Okay...that would be cool sometime. How 'bout tomorrow? Yes. No. Yes. Me? No...you...go...ahead. Yes.Okay, okay. I'll let you hit those books. Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid. Er, guy. Man. Son. This lady's here for you. That's great. Now remember, it's okay to play with yourself. Or, as I always called it -- "Stroke the salami!" Ho-ho, Jim. There's nothing to be ashamed of. Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating. Uncle Mort masturbates. We all masturbate. Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though. What you're doing is perfectly normal. It's like practice. Like when you play tennis against a wall. Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball. You do want a partner, don't you son? Jim? Okay, well that about covers it. Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate. Do you know about the clitoris? Oh, okay. Here's let me show you. These are for you. From father to son. You're not...busy? Can I come in? What the heck is this?So Oz, you almost made it, huh? Nah. Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight. But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her. And I don't know what I'm gonna say. So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing. Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean really fast. You're gonna shit your pants! Just go! Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now! No idea. You know, Jim...you could go back there...and... What are we gonna hear? Of course, Finch. What? This. Right now. This is your plan, Finch? I don't get it, that really works? Then what the hell are you talking about? Did you guys hook up or something? No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it. I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that. Of course. Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her? But that one time -- Well...I'm pretty sure I've -- You mean...and orgasm? What? Yeah. I'm not going. No, but come on guys, we made a pact! Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something? Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse. Jim? You fuckin' rule! Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good. How do you know that? Hey, minuteman. Holy shit! He's going in! Come on, Jim. Where are you? No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed! Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something. Just in time. I'll save you a seat. You can send me the address too. Went home to shit. No -- it's true. He is...really... big. Right. That gives us... Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny! That's what we are, we keep each other on track. Prior to this day, we've postured. We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too. No, a pact . No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate. Ow, what the hell? Gotta go. You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base? At least now I know what the hell they're saying. It's all good. Breath check. Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA. Beer in hand by five after. Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old. Finch, you got the Latin homework? I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt." Nothing, I just hugged her back. Oh no, Stifler, what did you do? Ho-lee shit. God dammit, Stifler! Stifler, you're such an asshole. What? Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying. Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but -- It did. I can't believe we just had our senior prom. That was a great night. Victoria...I love you. Okay. Yeah Vick? Like, normal style. The...missionary position. So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it? Yeah, right here. Me too. Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. You comfortable? See -- this is the nicest room. Now?! Yeah, we have something great, Vick. About the other day...I've been thinking. It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving. Hey... I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay? I didn't say that. I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong." No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special. You want to do it? Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them. Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways. We've come a long way since Homecoming. That's my trick! You're not doing the extra credit problems. Just a second! Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs. And I want to try to make it up to you. Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead! I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot. Vicky, wait. Okay, don't stop. Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it? Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship? You got in. "Dear Ms. Hughes. We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are." It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in. Hey. I got another question for you. Qualify for what? Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do. What?! How do I do that? Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know... Ready for what? Does it tell me how to get laid? What? Not the Bible? Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know. What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number. Yeah, but we'll still see each other. Wow. You two really have something going, don't you? I guess we'll call you two-ply. He didn't? I don't care. It was a pact . You break it and there are no excuses. You guys have to -- Attitude? Me? I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic. Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for. We're in this together. Don't back out on me now! I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it. And that leaves you trailing, Jim. You gotta get your act together. Observe. Nah, you get kind of dizzy though. I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it. So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance. Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it -- This is different. This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated. I put in months of quality time with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong. That's the spirit. Feeling better, Oz? Then where does a blowjob figure in? How the hell do you know all these random songs? You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch? You ever hear of something called The Bible? Then she said -- she loves me.What's that? You've just inherited The Bible. That's good, that's what I needed to hear. Now you qualify. Uh -- forget that. Look, is that all you're interested in? Ways to get your girlfriend into bed? Try the spicy tuna hand roll. Say that again, Kevin? Whoop, you're fading out. Good luck at that party. You know what, nevermind. You're not ready. Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that. Have you ever heard of the bible? Just dial 976-Asshole. You called me to ask me how to get laid?I'll do it. Oh, well... It came from the heart. Sorry. Sorry, coach. -- Thanks, coach -- Thanks coach. I'm not good in math. ...okay... Like what? Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova. Suck me...beautiful? There's something about the spring that's just cool. Like the smell of fresh rain or something. Great evening, isn't it? I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy. I know, it sucks! You called me Oz. No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but -- No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score. It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know. There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather. No. I'm missing the game for you. I'm not playing. Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later. I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it... ...I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor. I know. Salt and pepper? Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar? Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player? I really have no idea. Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers? You want onions? Onions? So you're going to Michigan? My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off. Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar. If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it. Uh...my dad's the manager. ...okay. Cool then. I'm um, I'm glad you came by. I mean, really. You talked to Stifler? How did you know I was here? Because I want to. I wasn't making fun of you. What? No I'm not. What?! You don't like it? Nice car. Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good. Neither will I. Forget it. You can call me Ostreicher. You can call me Oz. Hey, what're you doing here? I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested. Yeah...so like, what else do you do? I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that. Oh sure. I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am. Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive. Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right? After high school. It's true. I mean, after this, everything'll be different. I know. I'll just say that we had a great night together. Come on, Kevin. Vicky's looking for you. I still think you're okay. You've still got a chance with Nadia, right? You can do that? Hey guys, you came to watch me in action? Oh that's really reassuring. And don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a fraud. Feels like warm apple pie, dude. Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out. Who cares? Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded... "Fun loving" -- insane. You guys got the Latin homework? Is there anything you don't jerk off to? She's a cartoon , dude. She's a mermaid, dude. Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit. Fuck yeah we will. I think we're falling in love. Yeah. So you want double condiments on that? And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid. ...Guess what? Kevin, it was just a -- Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude? Okay, explain. What reputation? So does your tongue cramp up? Dude, prom sucks. The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite! Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid. No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man? I'm such a loser. Contact, dude. It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake. And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide -- Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that. Once, in church, dude. Oh shit dude, the L-word! Our last game is this Saturday. Come on, you know the words, sing along. Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears. Stifler, fuck -- ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive. Yeah ! Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me. This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot . Keep it down, dude. Shut the fuck up. Dude, he does not. She works part-time at my dad's store. Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick! Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new. Depends if my date wants to stop by. Stifler!!Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore. Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately? This just got a hell of a lot better. Check-out time! Please vacate the room. SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL! Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway? You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you? Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd. No shit. No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. Oh my fucking God. You're gay. I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right? Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo. You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss? What the fuck are you doing here? I think you need your balls reattached. You actually said that?! Haaaah!! Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store. Bullshit. From where? Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em. That junior chick? You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface? NOVA!! No way. Doing what? Uh huh. Here, babe. Yep.Tell your friends. Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes. Please, have a seat. I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer? I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that. You'll have me, after all I've done to you? I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess. And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before? You came up here looking for the portal? I'm sorry for everything. Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was. The iguana? He's a lucky man. Do I know him? I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful. I love you so much. I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster." Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole. That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart. Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage. Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine. I'm a puppeteer. Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop. It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding. Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously. Tell her you need to see her. Shut up! Yeah, well welcome to the nineties. I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry. Life is confusing, isn't it? Don't forget me. We? And he was with her. You were him last night, weren't you? We wish. What about Maxine? What's that? You've always loved the animals. No they're not. What? You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked. I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak? After dinner I'll show you my puppets. I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that. You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems. So how was it? What was he doing? Why? How was it? This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right. What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking. Why aren't you at work? Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop? Tomorrow. We're late for Lester. You weren't you. You were John Malkovich. We'll talk about it in the car. Okay. Maybe tomorrow. I'll meet you on the turnpike. Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house. Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now. What? Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich. All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while. Yeah. You want a beer? Right. The ferret? I'm sorry. How was your evening? Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away. Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We�re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is. Hi. Just an idea I had. Yeah, just an idea I had. Hmmm. Hmmm. We have to make it an early night. Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here? I... puppeteer. I'm a puppeteer. May 11th. Yeah. Okay. Which one is Elijah again? What? The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job. We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate. Enjoy. Morning. With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood. Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you... I know. I'm sorry... So how was it? You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience. Sure, after a fashion. Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually. Holy shit! He said what I said! Holy shit, yes! I can't believe it. This is too good to be true. Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I�m in love with somebody else. I am a trained performer. I said "yes." Yes? Forget it. My name is Schwartz. Schwartz. Schwartz. No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester. You're insane. Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about. Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1/2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other. No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and... No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately. Dr. Lester... Thank you, sir. Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and.... Dr. Lester. . . That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run. Yessir. Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now. Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion. The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history. I'll keep that in mind, sir. I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you? Just one. Why is this floor so short? No. I understand perfectly. No. You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester. Glooph is not a letter, sir. Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer. Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke. No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary. Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester. But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny. What happens when a man climbs through his own portal? Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house. Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. You're glowing again. You're evil, Maxine. I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like. Are you torturing me on purpose? This is amazing! We're gonna be rich! My God. Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in. Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence! You wanted to be partners with me? But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it. Tickets to Malkovich? Yes, of course. He's a celebrity. Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away. He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century. There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike. This is important! Don't you want to know what happened to me? It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine. Please, let me explain. Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see... Hi. Well, I'm a puppeteer... No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you. I mean, I am really attracted to you. I�m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male. That's the usual? No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or... I like you. I don't know what it is exactly. I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something. What'll you have? Yeah. But enough about me. Buy you a drink, Maxine? Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine. Maxine. Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine! That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops! I'm right? Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine? How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight. I just wanted to say �hi.� Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work? No, really. You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something. Emily Dickinson. Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp. Is that true? Moving story.Says me. Do you dream often? It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them. Do you dream often?I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly. There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly. You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain �doors� which should never be opened. And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking. I see. Are you unhappy at our little company? More beet-spinach juice, my friend? Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it. Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water. Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz. Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig. Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. �Ladies,� I begin. �I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven... All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you. I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz. No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me. One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz. Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears. Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation. Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions? Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz. Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying." Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order. You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph? Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp? She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you�re implying. Security. Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know. Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek. Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire. I was just asking. No disrespect intended. Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry? I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan. Do tell. I love a good plan. Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational. The Great Mantini? What kind of circumstances? How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no? I like that. A scary dream? Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him. The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions. We saw his show at the Luxor last night. Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir. And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich. Good morning, Lotte! Thank you, Floris. Yes, my dear? Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine. Forget it. Floris, get Guinness on the phone. Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle. But of course. Anybody else? Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil. I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel. I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route. Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal. I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours. No! Don't harm the vessel! Aaaahhhh, the portal! Oh, sorry. Right this way. Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video? What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself! Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing. You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear. My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to. You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word. No you mustn't, my child. With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know. Oh, be still my heart. Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno. I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz... I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now... This is my fiancee Maxine. Yeah, okay. I don't know. I never played a jewel thief. Thank you. Malkovich. Yeah. It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court! This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God. I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see. That... was... no... simulation. Let me try! Let me try. Simulates? Holy shit! He said what I said! Holy shit, yes! Maxine... Do you? Says who? Do you? I gotta know the truth, Kevin. I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something? I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out. I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte. Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth. Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've... It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy. Who needs dancing? Is there dancing? I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night." Sounds boring. Are there any songs? Never heard of it. What's the play? How do we do that? She's not available. Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. Did you see the reviews? Good-bye, Maxine. Derek Mantini! Honey, we can be happy and poor together. I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. I've got to leave Malkovich. Sleepy suddenly. They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. He's a selfish bastard. I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today. Vegas. Can you arrange that? Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute. Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini! No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it. No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product? You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls. Really? Yeah. Okay. You mean with Malkovich? Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists. No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit. I'm getting better all the time. Oh, so the bitch escaped. Yes. How did you know it was me? Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court. Come on in. What the fuck is going on? No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go. Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here. Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me! Yes, Maxine, yes. No, I guess not. I'm an actor. I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"? Oh sure. It's very rewarding... Oh, I'm really glad you called. Can I get you a drink? How'd you get this number? Who's calling? Yeah?Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen. Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out? Frank, take it easy. what happened? He's not a cop, he's a medic. I'm CY Coates. It's okay, Kanita. Come on in. Mary ... Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot. That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank? What about Kanita? I've been thinking about things. Meditating on my financial future. You guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. Whatja do, stop for Chinese on the way over? There's plenty of food in my place. So, Frank, am I going to live? I can't hold up my head anymore. No! Just take it easy. That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle. Sleep is all stress reduction. Here. You take one of these, sleep two hours, that's all you need. Why do you think I'm telling you this, Frank--for my health? You ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass of water. Red Death? Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that. That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these. I'm always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as I can imagine. Here, sit down. What's it like? Tell me some war stories. She wanted something to help her sleep. I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it? Sleeping in the back. Mary said you might be coming.What if there is no tomorrow? No ... I don't think a week's gonna do it. You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again. You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong. I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard. It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker. I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you. You can trust me on this one. She's having a baby. Twins. Thanks for the translation. What's your name? Nombre? Can you walk? Puedes caminar? Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada? Pregnant. No. Dead. I was tired. I needed a coffee. You're going to live. They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm. Does that hurt? I guess I'll be going. Is this what you gave Mary? I should be going. I just quit. Did you give Mary something called Red Death? Got a beer? Mary, we really have to go. I better just go in and see her. She asked me to pick her up. Where is she? Frank Pierce. The pitch, high heater. Bucky knows what's coming. He steps in, smash, over the green monster. What the hell. The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate. Yeah? No, I'd better not. That's a hell of a swing you got there, Noel. I'm thinking Strawberry in his prime. Shut up. You're going to die and he's not. Got it. You're not going to die. Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas. Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed. You came out of the hospital. You were tied down and hallucinating. You got some bad chemicals in your head, Noel. There's some medicine at the hospital that will fix that. I can't. I have to stay with my patient. Frank. There's no time. No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody. Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza? No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap. It'll be a while before he's up and running again. He'll be all right. I need to sit down a minute. Because you can barely walk. Mary. Mary, we've got to get going. We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath. Fifteen minutes. You asked me not to come. Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you. Maybe I should come up with you. Okay. Don't seem so bad to me. Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble. Sure. Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest. I think I'd remember that. You learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. But then something good will happen and everything will just glow. Five years. It's been bad lately, but it's always bad. Ah, no. I was. It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too. They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess. We moved out after that. Upstate. I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament. You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago? When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle? It's best not to ... It's good pizza, huh? He's better. That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own. He wants to pull that tube out. It's pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it's a good sign. Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like. I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could. How is she? I think it looks good. You look so different. Well, the doctor says he's showing some movement. It's still early, it might mean nothing, but I thought you'd want to know. Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news. She should go home. He's working a double shift. No. Our Lady of Misery. Yes. Yes. It's okay. They're prescription. Works better with a little whiskey. Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now. Even when you say the things, there's always more things. At least he's got people around him. You never know. The first is always the best. I wouldn't do that. The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder. I guess there's always a chance. We'd better go outside. Quickly. He's very very sick. His heart's beating. Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked. Do you have any music? I quit! I'm through! Greatest job in the world. I'll drink to that. I hate vodka. I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding. You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look. Don't give me that look. Backup? Three legs. It's coming. Hold her down. What's wrong. I need a drink, that's all. She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me. She's no whore, Marcus. What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love. Thanks. I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this. She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving. Make a left here. I want to stop. Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story. He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon. Is it true that you and Love went on a blind date? She hit you with a bottle? I think the worst is over. The ghosts-- The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now. Where's Burke? No. Last show of the night. A medical miracle. What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator? How many times have you shocked him tonight? Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity. The family know? What do you think? That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone. He one of them? He got better. Yes. I'm sorry. He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry. He's dead, Rose. Your father passed. We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right. Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear! Do it! Get the kit! We're gonna tube him! You learn that in the army? That's ridiculous. Okay, whatta I do? He's crazy. He can't help it. What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom. Destruction, distraction. I feel the need. I don't know--let's break some windows. Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something. That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die. Let's get in a fight, then. C'mon, Tom, pick up a job. As long as we keep moving. No standing still. How's he doing? Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then. Better bring it all. It's early for him. I never felt better in my life. I've taken that into consideration. I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself. C'mon, Tom. The city's burning. Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it? The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital. Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso. Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me. These are hard times, Tom. I'm sick, Tom. I need a cure. Vitamin B cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. Not as good as beer, but all I got. It's not worth it, Tom. He's surrendering. No way! One more time! You sure? Used to be my partner. You really think so? Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else? Yeah, you're right. Take me back, put me to bed; I surrender. We've done enough damage tonight. I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night. Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls. Faster! Well why didn't you say so? They'll just keep calling. Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk. Mr. Oh. Don't push it, Larry. You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe. What? I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet. I'm not hungry. What? I think the moment that food hits your mouth we'll get a job. No we can't. He's got a pulse.Stomach again. You're in the stomach! Let me try. You're in the stomach! Jesus, Tom Walls, that crazy motherfucker. He's crazy. Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots. You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here. You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that. Relax, will you. Faster! God! He's drunk. Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh. It's not our job to taxi drunks around. It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it. You're burned out. That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank. You know what. The radio. Turn it off. Coffee and whiskey, lucky you ain't dead with that diet. Wait, I've got it. Half fried chicken with fries. Let's go, hurry up. Come on. Oh yeah, you don't eat food. I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting? Oh no!--I just remembered. Turn here. You missed it. The Chink is on 3rd. The Chinese close in five minutes. Beef lo mein. It's been on my mind since I woke. Whatjathink? No shit. Ten-four. Don't go. Not this time. Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra. Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there? Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else. No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing. You see, he's giving it to us anyway.No underwear? In that time, you ever have sex? You know each other a long time? Ten-four. Let's do it! It's Marcus, Love, only for you. Ten-four, hon. Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me. She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio. Ten-four, hon. This is for you. I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good. Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival. What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin? What's his name? He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it. No. He's dead. Okay, what happened? You can't leave me now. Where you going? Here's to the greatest job in the world. Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking. We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way. What look? It's coming. That's too many. What's that, Frank? Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first. No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift. We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me. Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you. You don't know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. Come on, let's go look at some hookers. The Kit Kat will be letting out. Don't ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. They get real mad. Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand? Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up. God help us, he's hungry too. Oh, Frank, you've got it bad, so much worse than I thought. Who's that? No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him. I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside? He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back. She loves me the way no woman ever has. She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy. It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy? Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last. My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?You're crazy. Frank! Frank! Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better. If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him. Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us-- Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again. This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him. Let me think. You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy. Why? What do you want to break? Who with? You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call. C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood! Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight! I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty. I don't think the fire people can touch him out there. Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out. Whadda we bring? That's all right, we're not meant to do Oh tonight. Something is going to happen. I can feel it. Mr. Oh. You okay? The brakes are shot. Whatja doing? Where you going? Look out! Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto. Ten-four. El Toro de Oro. Blast off. Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives. Yeah. Great, isn't it? Come on, Frank. There's blood spilling in the streets. No prisoners. Don't worry, Frank, just a little psychological first aid.Come on, Night Shift. ...if we don't get out of this tunnel! ...that is going to explode... Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb... It's a damn postal truck! Shit! Damn. Unbe-fucking-lievable. Oh, shit. ...shit. Oh... help me get in the truck. At least somebody likes this shit. Okay, okay. What, do you work for my boss, dog? That's right. you see, that was a-that was my mission. Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls. My code name was Blackjack. Night Shift was my coach. Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach. I was undercover as a tennis player. It all started with our mission in Istanbul. You know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game. I feel faint. Oh! Bullshit, yeah. Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'. But he didn't. See, that's negotiation. ...-tiatin'. I was not in the man's face. I was nego-... Thank you very much. I think so too. I'll handle this from here, sweet Owes us a little restitution. ...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution. ...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country... Right. You damn skippy. And now that I am both jobless... Hello. ...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt? Who put the big hurt on... ...truck that kept Elvis cool? Who drove the ice cream... Always the negative... Stop limpin' around like that. Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey. We are heroes, my man. It's time to start actin' like it. We're the shit. Bigtime. You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel. Well. Why'd you stay behind?! Look out. Okay. Come on, big guy! Got it? Come on, darlin'. I gotcha. Go. Hang on, hang on. Sorry. Hold this. Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway! Can we get out on your end of the tunnel? Vitelli! Vitelli! What? What? All right It's melting, man. Mason. Forty-nine point four. Shoot me. Unbe-fucking-lievable. Stupid. What the--? What do you think I'm doin'?! Whoo! ...tunnel! ...here comes the... Okay... He's comin' up fast! ...they come! Here... We've got Elvis! We! Oh, shit. Okay. Okay. ...on! Hang... You got Elvis?! What? ...-natic. You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-... Come here. Okay, here we go. Come on, come on! Okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. All right, man. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. We're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?! What? We're gonna die! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! They're movin'. They're takin' off. Hey! Are you all right? Bullshit. You would've killed us anyway. ...man. A-And you owe me... ...or my conscience. ...squirm, I don't want his brains all over my shirt... Even though it is nice to see Andy... ...deal with this asshole. I think you oughta cut a... Hey. Mason. All right, all right. Hey, hey. Yeah, baby! That is loud! I'm Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here. ...miles. Split? I wouldn't get ten... ...shit. ...Long. Somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that Elvis... ...-er. It was your friend... ...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ... I mean, if that gun was... Not completely, anyway. To tell you the truth, you didn't. Well, shit. Could be worse. I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle. I remember him. Got in a car crash or somethin'. Robert Del Rio? How wonderful for you. You know. So I took his truck, yeah. Nobody's lookin' out for my interests. My credit was fucked! And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped. So I split. ...overdrawn bank accounts. ...just ready to just slide him right in there. And what about me, huh? What about Arlo, huh? What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans... ...or nephew or some good old boy... ...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it. But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin... And he swore, he swore once I got a degree... I deserve a lot more than that truck! Ten years, ten years I busted my ass for that fat rat bastard. You know what I'm sayin'? ...piece of shit was worth. Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck. Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled... ...-tion? See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-... ...did you? Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out... Worth a try. Okay. This thing just went up a degree. Ice cream's not workin'. Uh-oh. Whoo-hoo-hoo! All right. Hey. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, shit! Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. What? Oh, shit. Okay. Come on. You're not dangerous! You're crazy! I ain't gettin' in this damn thing! You're--? What?! He's crazy! ...man! Yeah, he's a dangerous... ...you're dealin' with! ...to him! You don't know who... Listen! Listen... Okay. All right. Okay. ...yeah. Yeah... Okay. Okay. All right. Okay. Oh, shit. It's okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. No. Shit. Oh, Pete. Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go, go. Shit. ...shit! Oh... Shut up! Okay. That didn't work. Holy--! Gee, you think so? What the fuck was that?! What are you talkin' about?! I'm the one drivin'! Whoo! ...you crazy bastard. Come on... Come on. Come on. ...Pete. Come on. Come on, old... ...wanna give it a try! ...Night Shift, but you might... ...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim... I know the likeli-... Come on, old Pete. Oh. ...Pete! Come on. Oh, shit. Come on, old... Come on. I'm goin'. I'm goin', baby. I'm goin', I'm goin'. God, man! Come on, old Pete. Come on! Come on, old Pete. Hey, hey! Whoo! Okay. I should've had that dog bite me. I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse! Oh, Petey. Oh, Petey. Oh, please, Pete. Please don't do this to me. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us! Everybody dies! Hey, and what if we don't make it?! Eight and a half feet wide! Weighs over five tons! You think we can make what?! You see that truck?! You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! ...Shift. Oh, we're screwed, Night... ...is, old Pete! Come on, baby! ...Pete! Come on! There it... Come on, old... Oh, shit. Oh! Hey! Hey! Andy's Ice Cream. ...waiting! Well, then, that means it's call... ...truck! It was owed to me. You stole the damn... I did not steal the truck. ...let live. ...I believe in live and... And I'm a peaceful man, and... ...you. Every time I look at you, I wanna hit... ...-er! ...-cho and a hijack-... ...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift. You're psy-... Hey, take a look at your situation and... Probably because they know a psycho when they hear one. Kiss my ass! ...gun?! Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty... Okay. Okay! All right! Get him to stand up, Night Shift. Oh... Oh, shit. You mean to tell me you hijacked me with an empty gun?! What? Take your gun! You're nuts, goin' back there! Okay. Okay, okay! We can't push old Pete in this heat. He can't take it. Hey. I ain't playin' that. I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man. I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me! Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula! I did not steal this truck! Yeah, borrowed! Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy. I ain't goin' through Missoula! To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula. No, no, no. ...-er. No, you gotta go to McGrud-... Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone. Oh, man. Do you wanna give me a minute? ...-ed. Damn diesel injections are flood-... ...all the time. It happens to this piece of shit... Damn. Are you kiddin'? I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna-- Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business. Man, I can talk all I want to. I'm gonna stomp your a-- That dog was mean before I met him. Yeah, to keep him off my ass. What the hell is with you, dog? He's the one with the damn gun. Would you hurry up, please? You are not takin' my truck! ...doing?! Hey, you're gonna piss me-- What the hell are you supposed to be... No. Peace. ...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. And if that Elvis shit... Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago. That shit will be worthless by noon. ...truck. You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my... ...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit! ...think he was a wacko. And I think that G.I. ninja's a bigger wacko. And I think you're the biggest wack-... Hey, listen! Do you know what I think? I... For cryin' out loud. ...ya? Wait, wait. You don't believe the dead guy, do... ...and a shitload of ice. No, no, no. You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck... Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off. What did I say? Sorry, man. He's dead. Aw! Oh, Jesus. No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. Oh. Huh? That'll make up the difference, huh? ...for Andy, I'll tell him I lost a few cartons comin' over the mountain. ...off. Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love... Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent... ...two things Andy is not. Uh, but I tell you what. ...and fair... He could've. That-That's true. But that would've been smart... Except for the fact that I need cash. Uh, huh? Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. Well, he told me to collect cash. Since today. New policy. Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars. And we need that in cash. Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick. No argument there. Great. Where do you want this stuff? Sam? Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind. ...-ty. ...yeah. Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-... Oh... Hey! Funny situation, ain't it, Andy? Well, well, well. Oh, my God. I don't ever wanna see another ice cream... ...frozen! So if you don't mind--! I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's... Listen, shithead! What'd he say? It's for you. I'll keep an eye out. That was quick. Be cool. Be-- Hey, be cool. Hey. ...help you? Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to... I ain't got time to argue with you today, Andy. But I can tell you this. Takin' your truck pissed you off? It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five. Well, that just about figures for today. Hey, actually... So you called the damned thing Elvis ...take my sorry old truck. Wait. This town is full of trucks. Nice new trucks. You don't need to go... Yeah, that's my truck. ...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for! He's the dude... Listen, deputy. Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?! Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though. No, sir. I've never seen this guy before. I'd say we're about even. Exactly. Us. Owe us. Thank you. ...on ice! We've got Elvis on ice! We've got it... Are you crazy?! Take the boat?! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!Vaughn. ...such is the price...of patriotism. But... And it won't be pleasant. Three seconds. One... ...without compunction. This country trained me to kill... I urge you to be persuasive. Your move. Okay, Vaughn, you drive. Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks. Don't be tedious, waiter. Dr. Long called it Elvis. ...within five minutes. Give it to me now, or you'll be dead... ...about him. We're worried... To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center. Maybe you know him. Richard Long. Forget about him. Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction... And let me guess. You failed. Almost quaint. "Went away." I like that. Went away? ...always done, Richard? What rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? The sorts of things you've... ...years of thinking the matter over, I began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem. ...you were right, of course. But after... Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in? Well... Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone. Mm-hm. ...and the government. Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you. Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you... ...-ple. ...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-... You look fit...healthy... You look good, Richard. Is this stool taken? There's nothing to say, doctor. Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said. Damn you, Long! My people are out there! Your people are out there! All right. One more shot, provided... we're off the island tonight. ...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against. ...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar! And let me tell you something else. I didn't join the service to let people like you turn... ...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons, and we're... The NSA thinks the UN is onto your work... ...-bility. This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long. You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-... Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation? ...to be off the island tonight. What the hell is all this about a detonation today? We're scheduled... ...-tor Long. Doc-... I'll do it. And I'm warning you, Leo. Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die. ...Destry, Fair Oaks.... ...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper... Or I may be wrong. The breeze could be gusting south. That'd be Billings... Hm. The wind's northwest. That oughta be...Seattle. ...-enworth. I'll have no compunction at all about using this. ...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ... ...-ians. But I assure you, Leo... Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-... And I don't like deviations from plans, Leo, as I'm sure you re-... Pleasant surprise. Good to see you again, Leo. Well, Lieutenant Vitelli. ...happen if I drop this? Do you know what'll... Nothing has changed, I assure you both. The Army still thinks we got Elvis. They had a tactical withdrawal. It's just those two amateurs now. Do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them? All right. Let's clear the mess and move out. Vaughn, Burke, move to the end of the street. Fan out and work your way back to the motel. Get 'em on line, then stall. Long can't have gotten far. Hit him again. Hit him. Carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier. He'll be more useful now. Carl! Set up the camera. All right. Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour. Of which we have more than enough. And so Missoula's prodigal son returns. You have no idea what you're in possession of, do you? Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for. Radio the bikes. Well. It appears someone's been lying to us. ...comes up that road. Dennis, radio the bikes. I wanna know if so much as a squirrel... Move. This is already affecting our schedule. This is it. Stay put. Keep the camera trained on... Get 'em in the middle of the dam. Having witnessed the effects myself, I can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts. We're gonna use them for demonstration footage. ...here! I wanna patch in from... Get your links set up! Dennis! Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn. Take these two behind the van. Prep the launcher now. Vaughn, get the M-seventy-nine ready. No. A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country. I almost remember what that feels like. You have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way. I think we can impose on you for a little overtime. Check the immediate area. Check it out. Vaughn. Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous... Richard Long. You know the suspect? ...-ty. ...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-... We were called in by the Jerome base... ...-mand out of Fort Bragg. I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-... Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.

Where's their protective... ...scientists. Jesus Chri-- We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam. A covert military operation riddled with civilian... ...screwup? ...what, Sam? Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major... But... ...-fall. Hemmings! Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-... They took that life away and left me with nothing. I would've in another life. Why? You're a nothing, nobody! Why? Where's Elvis?! No. It won't be long, gentlemen. ...-spite the mouth. ...and unharmed, de-... Your fellow hero, untouched... Bring him up. ...-tainer! It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason. Just give me the con-... I don't see my container. Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes. I got someone who's anxious to talk to you, Mr. Mason. And I can't guarantee the end will be quick. ...on this miserable road to nowhere. Because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end... ...never done a thing for you? ...to die for a country that's... ...and ask a simple question - Are you actually prepared... I want you to look at one another... ...your concern nor your fight. Relinquish the package and you can go. Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither... ...should be right outside. Odd, then, that his car... I assume you have one. Actually, I was just looking for a restroom. I beg your pardon? ...dangerous. Assumptions are always... Iced coffee. Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene? Is this your establishment?...have it. You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder. You-You can't let him... ...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it. ...here. Mason... ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in... Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-... I had no idea how powerful it was. We do need your truck. ...to Fort McGruder in his truck. Mason, you have to take this... So far, ye-yes. ...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island. All right. After they put you away... ...men every time I've closed my eyes? But after you went away, I-- Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those... Grateful? ...that. I know where the blame belongs. But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew. The government did... ...me? Well, you could've saved yourself the trip. Is that why you're here? To blame... No, go-- ...about-- ...I wish they would've let me say something... Andrew... It's too... You'll kill us all! No! No! ...destroyer of worlds." "I am become Death, the... Let's proceed. You have my word on that. ...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward. Now, I know. You have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe... Now listen to me. But you have no choice but to follow orders. If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine. I don't think I need to mention you could use the help. Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay? ...-lar. You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-... I don't work for you, Captain Brynner. And I changed the schedule. You know, I have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, Darlene. Ah. Uh, we both like to fish. Oh, no? Oh, caught a few, lost a few. Excellent. Couldn't sleep, Pumper. Is everything, uh, all right tonight? ...that the prey can bite back. And only then does our noble friend realize... ...-m-means, Mason. The only one who understands what this me-... You're the only one I can trust. Everything will die, Mason. Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees. ...or it'll ignite. The compound has to be kept cold... No... Mason. Some people might. ...is death. ...without caution... ...and that power... ...back... ...forcing him to strike. And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite... ...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive... Tie a fly... Turn the power of the hunter against him. There's only one way you can do it, Mason. How can we ever hope to win against the trout? ...the master of his realm. ...sensitivity without neurosis. He's... He's brains without ambition... ...is a perfect hunter. No, that's not possible, Mason. The trout... My secret? What? We don't have an hour. We're already supposed to be shut down. How much longer for the range and power projections? So reaction temperature is fifty degrees. Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?big balls. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ooh. Oh, oh!

What about all that "no need to get in the man's... Thank you. Yeah. Patriotism is its own reward. Us. Owes us. You. You, Arlo. Who had to put a gun to your head? You did help a little. Excuse me. I got a bullet in my leg. They aren't exactly gonna publicize this, Arlo. Elvis is still in there! It's gonna go off! What'd you come back for?! They'll meet you at the top. Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis. You go. Let's go! Yeah, yeah, yeah. ...another way outta here. Hey. There's gotta be... ...-ta get outta here! We got-... It's working. Come on. Come on. Oh. What?

I've got the real thing! Okay. Forty-five seven! Oh, fuck! ...-ful?! Aw, shit. Would you be more care-... Stop. Go! Sometimes the prey bites back. ...to him. That's why I didn't give it... Go, go, go! Arlo! Okay. Yeah. Come on! Reach into my pocket. Arlo! Arlo. Put your hand in my pants. Hey, hey, hey. Arlo, shut up. Hey, just shut up. Huh? Listen, Arlo. No. Ow! You all right? Bring him down! Yeah, I know, I know. Yeah. Whoo! ...split. Well, all the same. If we get to Missoula, help me find a car. I'd appreciate it. Then...you can... ...shit. ...for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this... Listen, Arlo... We got two paddles. Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene. And things sort of just went downhill from there. Couldn't deal with it. So I split. Never gonna throw a ball in the pros. ...hospital. And I put the car into a ditch. He spent eighteen weeks in the... We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar. I was drivin'. Yeah, Robert Del Rio. Started every game my senior year. Not all-American or anything, but not bad. Anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback. Got taken in the first round. We were nationally ranked. You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State. Yeah. ...truck. So you took his... It won't even start half the time. ...stole the truck. Hey, I didn't steal the truck. You... You're fucked, man. This river's fed by a glacier. Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees. What? No! Keep still. Come on! I don't want you to come anyway. ...here! Then stay... Taking it down the hill. I'm crazy? I'm a dangerous man! Hey, put it back! We're takin' off. All right, let's go. Aw, shit These'll keep it cold. Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that. Okay. All right. Come on. Go on. Hey! Hang on! ...ho! Ho, ho... Gee, you think so? Shit. You gotta pass him. You okay? I made it.

You snatch that phone from me one more time, I'm-- Shut up, shut up! It's beeping. ...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right? Yeah... You wanna hit me? Hi--!

Shut up. No, no, no, no, no. Keep goin'. Ah, one of them's in the back. ...-damn! God-... Fine. Shut up. ...fine. That's... Look, I don't give a shit if you go through Missoula at a hundred miles an hour. We're goin' to McGruder. ...the ice cream for money! ...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?! You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell... You stole this truck! That's... You stole this truck! You stole this truck. Borrowed. Am I missing somethin' here? ...-er. No way. We're goin' through McGrud-... No, no, no, no, no. We gotta go to McGruder! I go where the truck goes! Billings? No, no, no, no, no. We need to go to McGruder. No cell. We're clear. ...town. You'd better coast through... ...excuse me. Can you fix this? Excuse me... What the hell's goin' on? Come on! ...up. Shut... Come on, get in the truck. That dog ain't mean. What did you do that for? It makes him mean as a snake. You gave him ice cream, didn't you? Come on, let's go. There we go. There we go. Did you keep it safe? Did you Look, put this in the back. Keep it safe. Go on. I need your truck! All right, then how about this? I'll rent the truck from you. You can stay here, you can go. Whatever you want. I got fifty bucks. I'll get more. I got, uh.... I got, like, uh.... You want cash? You want cash? Wait, wait, wait. Hold up. Hold up. Look. All right. ...-er. Then you drive me to McGrud-... I need your help. Yeah, I believe him. He was my friend. ...-tana.

Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies. I could always give you that. He could've called first. ...moron. Andy. Another fuckin'... Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move. ...Darlene pay you in cash? Since when does... Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'? The guy's a fuckin' moron. That's my business. Art. Freezer in the back. Where's Sam? A little early for a delivery. You'd never understand! ...checked. Dead, last time I... Him first. Where's Arlo? ...the river. You try anything, it goes in... Yeah, I'm listenin'. Hello. Elvis is fuckin' dead, man. Get yourself some CDs. I don't know what the hell... Yeah? Like I say, Doc Long's... ...though. Not tonight... ...time to time, yeah. Doc Long. Yeah, I know him. Weirdo guy. He comes in from... ...Long. Doc... Assumptions are always dangerous. ...look like you're after something more dangerous. ...and a rifle. You, on the other hand... Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me. But mostly, well, they just take a six... ...deer. Quite a getup for jacking... I assume you want that to go. ....-lene. Yeah, they call me Dar-... Mornin'. We gotta get help. Aw, fuck! Damn. ...ready before the morning crowd blows in. I got it... Two pots of coffee... Yeah? I can handle it. ...-time, remember? Darlene, it's five-thirty. Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-... Let me have those. Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly. Yeah, I just.... Doctor. And what if it does? Cold? Cold. How cold? Call an ambulance. Shit! Oh, shit. Doc! ...fishin'. ...-to a simple thing like... Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-... ...like a fish. And I'm good at this. Been doing it since I was a kid. But you, I don't know. Somehow you think... ...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do. Yeah. Ten months we've been fishin' this river together. We use the same equipment, more or less... Been trying to figure out your secret. There's a vent shaft leading straight up. Yeah. God! They're gonna seal it. Forty-seven. I'm at mile marker... We've got the real thing! What we gave Brynner on the dam was a phony! Yeah, yeah... All right, go. You sure? All right. The Army, sealin' us in. Just go check the temperature. ...tunnel now! ...we're all gonna die in this... Wait. Listen to me, Pappas. If you don't let us by... ...side! His name's Vitelli. Talk to him. He's right out-... ...on the other end of this phone. ...there's a colonel... Listen, Pappas... ...any idea what's goin' on here?! You redneck idiot, do you have... Pappas! Move the car! You know, I gotta tell you. That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son." ...beer. I didn't sell the boy any... ...seriously. I don't sell beer to minors. I take that kinda thing... ...-lem? Nope. Is there a prob-... If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'. Oh. Arlo. Talk to me. ...-damn phone. Gimme this god-... Get in The usual. Doc. Okay, doc.Bullshit. Put the phone down, Mason. What the hell's a sage? ...-lem too? You got a prob-... That's right. ...general store. Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome... Right. Tim Mason. Mind if you tell me what's goin' on? After that re-... The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out. Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle. I told you Mason was walking shit. Thanks. ...son. That little geek is my... Fol-... Yeah, I'm sure. I'll lead 'em out. Jesus. What the hell was that? Don't move! What happened to Colonel Brynner? Now raise 'em! ...stole a truck under arrest. Yeah, asshole. I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who... I said let me see your hands now! ...hands! Let me see your... Then how about if I call you "ass-... ...to talk, son. Shut your mouth until I tell you... ...public drunkenness.... Mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you. We've got your whole record. We know about the-the conviction for vagrancy... Lying? That's not the way I... ...selling this young man beer Wednesday night. So you don't remember... Got that? ...you answer mine. ...badge someday, then you can ask the questions. Until then... You find yourself wearing a... Do you recognize this young man? ...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'? So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter. Don't think it's not going to cost you. Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight. Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up. I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover. Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field. I don't think that bothered him. He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat. Greg McConnell. Where did you say she's from? Any ideas who it could be? - none taken -On my mother's life. Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen? Annette, how long have we known each other? From who? Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded. Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit. Is there a mutual feeling between you two? That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth. He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before. Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central. I told you I don't know. I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone. No. Who is this? She bought it. I'm pretty sure she did. Yes! Yes! Yes. Positive. I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you. Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about. Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career. I told you to lock the door. Get out of here. Jesus! Oh baby... oh baby...What, your virginity? Well that's over now. You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive. I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed. I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up. Why aren't you understanding? It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up. This isn't working out for me anymore. Sure. Hi. It was perfect. Hi. Get off me. Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite. Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites. Good for you. Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here. I just came to say goodbye. Yes. Why can't we be together? Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus. I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me! Because I'm in love with you. You know what? I don't take it back. You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you. You don't know Monsieur Philipe? My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino. Am I bothering you? No. I am lighten. Can we drop this? I do not. I can't win with you. Yes it does. I did. We played three games of backgammon and... I don't. I do. What? It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week? Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa. I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive. Need any company? Alone again. What are you up to today? I will. Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation. Of Human Bondage. Reading. Okay? Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go. How was your date? Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing. I'll leave this afternoon. Happy? What? Without question. Yes. Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind. Doing what? How about tonight? Who? Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning? Don't you believe in love at first sight? Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you. I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away. Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me. I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night. I said I was sorry. Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology. How are you today? Need a lift? What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before? It's my house. Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that. You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles. Do you deny that there's an attraction between us? Why not? I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out. Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend. No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit. You implied it. About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person. Refreshing. Is that the last thing you need? My your clever. Give me the fucking letter. You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? What? Another letter from your friend? Thank you. Please. Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool. Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it. That's a matter of opinion. Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature. Great book. What'cha reading? You talking to me? Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me. Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends. Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me? Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip. How do you know I've been with several women? Oh really? Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced? I must say I found it rather appalling. I read your teen beat manifesto. I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry. You a lesbo? Why not? Got a boyfriend back home? So what year are you going into? Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me. No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended? Outstanding. Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf? Too bad he's in Kansas this summer. Are you shitting me? What do you mean? It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year. The football stud? Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas? Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now. - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me. Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense - Good night Cecile. No. I'm taking a shower. No, you were fine. You think? Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done. For the first time, yes. It'll pass. Some other time, Cecile. I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there. You promised to let me kiss you. I swear. Of course. I'm not a monster. Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss. Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway. Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up. I was just kidding. I'm sorry that was out of line. Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off. Just taking your photo. He'll love it. Excellent. It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself. I'm what you would call a fifth year senior. How are things down under? Blossoming I hope. What, nervous I'm going to win? Really? Care to make a wager on that? Yummy. Well, you don't have to get nasty about it. You do? It works a little. Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help. Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer. Same time next week? Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true. I do. I know. I know. Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line. One. McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is. Where is she?! Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you? Is she with you? I'll be in touch. Pretty sure or sure sure? And you think she bought it? You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded? You told her I never said I love you before? Did you do everything I asked you to? Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you. Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer. -- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah. Whoa! Greg, is that you under the covers? Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit. Baby? Right on time. War it is. Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three. I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed. I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy. Get out? We had an arrangement. I'm very sorry about that. I apologize. Will you calm down? In any event, you still owe me my reward. Come again? Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette. Thank you. Now, where were we? Ronald? I thought we should celebrate. Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again. You wanted an answer to your question. I have a flair for drama. Screening calls. Any suggestions? I've never done this before. That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it. I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet. Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you. Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest. What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way? No, I'm not. And I don't. It clearly is why. I'm not in the mood. Some other time. Mock, mock, mock. It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part. I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card. It was... Fantastic. Oh yes. Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. Bad time? Where'd she go? Where is she? A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified. I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it. Exactly the opposite. If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no. With who? Morning. Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do. I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected. If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh. Nothing. Shut up. Yeah. Take a look for yourself. Yippy. You amaze me. Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that. Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause. Who are you calling? Any day now. Moving along quite well. I hate it too. Oh sis. You're so tense. I'm at your service. But who will they turn to for help? What's your plan of attack? Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that. Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat. I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter? You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me. You would not believe what-- Okay. Blow me. I'm working on it. Even there? What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car. Be more specific. And if I win? What are the terms? Could you be more desperate to read it? Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art. Care to make a wager on that? It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory. Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue. Shut up and turn to page 64. That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius. Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold. Sounds intriguing. I see your point... though why should I care? Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court? So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum. You don't mean? Sorry. What? Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual? Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house? Outstanding. It's really important. Fine. Could you please see that she gets this. Annette! Annette! Do you know when she'll be back? Do you know where she is? I need to talk to Annette. Well please leave a message that I called. It's desperate that I talk to her. Hi. Is Annette at home? I said, do you want some water? Yep. Then I fucked your daughter. Uh huh. You beat me three times. Right after we played backgammon. Yes, you already did. I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here. Do you mind if I check upstairs? Did she show up? What time is it? Ronald, I'm sorry. Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about. Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too? What are you talking about? Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and - Hey Ronald. Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter. You're a lucky guy.Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me. I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights. I'm moving out. It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack. You thought it was me? Where is she? Is she all right? Our neighbors gave me a ride. How's your mother? Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch. Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father? Jeanette, you're hurting me. No. Only celebrities now. Now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he'd better have killed someone or no one will buy it. This one to Dr. Rumpley. They celebrated the common person. Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor... Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell? Look at your face. I had a car that color. What do you love her or something? She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die. You had a busy night last night. Anything good? At what point? No! Do they show you having sex? Do they show it? What if--you're vomiting?Oh, Al ... This is just... What?! Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can -- Went -- Yes! Al!! Al! No. I'm not -- I didn't -- Al, you know how I feel about you... Well, I don't think you can get more common than me, Al. Yeah, so... ? Who? Come on... Yeah. Ma... Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her. No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you. Yeah. I brought you some movies. At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me. No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away. I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing -- I guess -- I don't -- it's all in the contract. There's this million-page contract -- What if I'm vomiting? No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then - Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do. No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me. You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say - "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show. Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again! You said a woman likes to be pursued. Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved -- What if Shari's the dream? You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet." Stand back -- I'm about to do my Happy Dance. Yeah?! They tore her dress! ... Sure. Yeah? And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again. I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants. Could we just talk alone for a second? I -- Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that. No, uh... Um, yeah -- thanks. Cool. Excuse me. Oh, see, studying would've been a huge help. Where were you, then? Al! I thought -- I thought he was dead. Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel? Really? They were.. What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he... Mm... Oh, man... Thank you. Can I see her? Yes? So he killed himself. And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again. Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby... Jessica! You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl? What? Yeah. Honey, if you're watching this is for you. Aah, I wanted Shari to come. Hey, if it's free, it's me. You ready? Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something? So do I. So what? I'm doing all right. I'm gonna stick this right in your eye. Tell me. You said that. What? And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home. Ma... You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this? Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't! Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him? But Al is your husband now! Why? How... Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know. The doctor said you were having sex. So you had sex with him? Who? What happened? I'm coming right over. I'll be right there. Oh God. What hospital? What's the matter?! Mom? What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean... Who? If I don't call you "Dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives -- or when I thought you came into our lives -- Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out. The difference is for twenty years I thought one thing and now it's another thing. So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse. Could've been a nurse? But what was that whole story about him and a nurse? Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve. He says -- Holy sh-- Yes to me or yes to the coil? So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything. I'm not! I'm just trying to get some facts. I mean, that worked out. You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left. Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time. How's Marcia? She all right? No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay? No! And that girl has a name. I don't want to -- do you know where he is? Hey, he cheated on her. Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and -- Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you. Do you want us to come in the kitchen? Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I -- Yeah. The camera guy is here. Yeah? I'm sorry. Where'd they send her? What are you talking about? Well, when will she be back? What is she, at work? Hi. Is Shari here? Shari, Ray feels -- No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right? Right, yeah -- What's going on over there? All right. Let them decide. Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be? I can't? All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network! I can imagine. You said you wanted nothing to do with this. You swore to me. "Don't come near me. Don't bring this into my life..." Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me. Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you? Our what? No! I barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I'm regularly in contact with they want releases from. I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him. How much less? He's just ... trying a little too hard -- What does this mean? Are you asking me? Hey, Lou. Who's in it? Well, then I'm quitting. You batted or you bunted? Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me? What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision - But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV. Hah? My lovely assistant, Shari. I'm glad you asked. The contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I'm not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the North American Broadcasting System which owns Real TV. Let's have a contest. Now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. But anyone can join in. It's nice. What did you do to your hair? Kinda'. Come on. Well, yeah, everybody's someone. But I mean someone they want to be. I mean let's face it, I'm working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, I wish I was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." At least for a month I'm not just a guy with a name tag. I'm famous. You see how people look at me. Like when they ask for my autograph or say "Hi" to me... It's like I'm a basketball player or a... you know, like I'm someone. Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides... No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment. What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?! It's not their fault. Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you. She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right? I need to talk. Come on... Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while. Somewhere. Come on, let's go. Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time. So? Really? Exactly. Boy, you're smart. Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you? "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I? Who the hell do you think I should be dating? Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care. Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... Ohh... No. Who? Shari... So...? ...if this ... ... weren't here... ? Shari, I really like you... So? What do they think -- we're not kids -- I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done. What? He could give me some oxygen. I wish my stepfather was here. Saturday, I think we should Oh -- Sunday is good for me to meet your folks. We get a big family audience on Sundays so it works out. It's quite an honor. Will you come with me? You know, the big machine that cleans the ice. Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni. It's really a tremendous turnoff. You know, I never saw you in your uniform before. I missed you. Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird. Really? Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do? All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you. Can't we just -- Well, when you put it that way. It's... okay Yeah. Look, not having been there... I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him. Oh... how come? Okay ... I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something -- Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then... No, no, I -- as soon as you came in tonight I said to John, "Boy Shari looks beautiful." I said it on TV so you can ask anybody who saw it. You do though, you look great. So maybe this is my dynamite. Dynamite. I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ? Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here. Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you. I hear the dog really liked him. A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy. Me?! That's you! Yeah. My problem is I've got a brother who writes a sentence like "We grew up in a small, little bedroom." As opposed to a big, little bedroom? Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." I put his -- who -- Look, Marsh, he's not that good a singer, he'll be back. Me?! Ray, come an-- What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me -- Look, we gotta talk. Oh, man, I've been trying to call you. ... Ray? If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too. You brought the girl! Why me? I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple. Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop? What is this? What's going on, who is that? We'd better go... Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then. You watching the ballgame? It's me, Ed. Great. She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They -- What's the dif -- Oh, Jesus. Ray -- Marcia's living with a singer? Ray, maybe this isn't ... No. What happened? See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there. Polish acrobat. Yeah. All right. Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please -- I don't know. Screw off. I'm doing all right. Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me? Why do you do that? You would do this? You would actually -- Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just... I ... I'm not gonna do it. Hi, Shari. Let's go in the stockroom. We're excited. Thumbsucker! That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA. You're in show business? What is?! What are you drunk? What? What do you mean all of a sudden? You've been going with her six months. Where were you? No -- keep it. No problema. You want a picture? Who's -- Hi, Shari. Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired? No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you. -- That we were doing "together." I finished it. It came out great! Because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "That's too much glue. You're using too much glue." The pirate ship. Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model. All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out. I gotta go. So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this." Oh, man! So... What... The whole time? Eighteen years? It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this? It's Ed. No. Am I supposed to? Hi. Ohh... do you own a cat? Ohhh... Mm. Mm. What is? Oh, dinner! Can I help with anything? Sure. No. Hm? Oh!! Um... They gave me a limo, uh... Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny... Thanks... That's ... Hi. What?... Why?Oh. Right. Right, right... Oh right, right! She fell down, like a... When? Today? No! Don't -- Oh, wow. Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute? Yeah. You did good. What's wrong? Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this? Your brother's here. I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag. We're the guys who clean up after the parade. You know who we are? We're falling behind. Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed. Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you. Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.And each contestant gets one of these. An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt. I commit. I take a chance. You wanted to be the guy on TV, but you didn't want to say you wanted to. So you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it's not your fault. I got paid by the word! No! Your problem is you don't ever want anything to be your fault. You know what your problem is? Come on, Ma. That's right. You put Cliff on television. So then he decided he was too good for her and he left. Cliff left her, thanks to you. Good-bye, brother! Cassie... Save it. I know. Yeah. Please! You brought the cameras here! No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes. It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ... Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God! Yeah... Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep. Hi. Who is it? While I'm gone, tell them about our cousin Lenny who's gay. We knew from when he was five. What are you, hiding from the Police? Show your face, you look great. Doesn't she look great. "Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee. Richie! She spent six months dating a criminal Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name? She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake. I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place? Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met. No, this is great. You'll love this. He's a singer. That's our sister. She's got a new boyfriend. Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia? Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system. Hey. Check this out. Look at this. Yeah?! Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot. Hi. That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us. How many opportunities are you going to get in your life? You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies? Oh Yeah? What's your master plan here? All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this? What? In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something -- Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you! What? I got your message. Way to go! I'm making a tape. I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter! Yeah. I service video equipment. Show business. Yeah, but let's stay on one subject. Whoever that person is is going to be famous. They'll be able to get whatever they want. They'll ... trust me, this is my business. That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch. You know, that would be like a great thing. I know. I mean I'm sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I'm playing "Risk," with her kid brother, Leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least I hope it was the dog. 'Cause her mother disappeared for a while. I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents. What's up? If they keep Ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment. For instance... me and my friend Bucky are buying out my boss. His equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear. That's the point -- this could change things. We don't have foibles. Look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?He ended up moving back to Milwaukee to live with his parents. I haven't heard from him in a long time. Poor guy. I warned him. I'm not talking about ethics. I'm talking about morals. That was just talk! Fantasy talk! What are you, nuts? We talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. I would never. . . I mean, I take very seriously our strict moral code. The line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral. Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend. What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop. But you haven't written your novel. In love? You did it at your house? Your own house? You could tell Dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy. Don't tell me that. I don't want to know that. A few months before the election, she'd had an affair with my best friend Dave Novotny. Well, Sherry's great. But she can be a little much sometimes. Yeah. No. I mean, you know. Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads. Yeah, just -- Yeah, uh, just a minute He likes it. Around that time Diane and I were hanging out a lot at Sherry Novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time. Everything's fine. Just, you know, school. Thank God for Diane. She was my best friend, my source of love and strength. Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy times, but we'd always seen them through. After nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever. And the secret? Good communication. Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing - It happens, Larry. People make mistakes. He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more. Mostly Tammy fans I think we've got a problem. Larry? Huh. Okay. Well, I guess I'd better do my count. Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won. You're kidding, right? What d'you got? All right. I'll be back I just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. We don't have much time until eighth period. I have other things going on, too, you know. Fine. So do your count. Start with president, and I'll be right back. What? Right. So let's start counting. You will. You'll be fine. What a surprise. Oh, is this...? God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time. Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him. What's this? Well, I... I... that's very nice of you. Coming to see me. Are you trying to. . humiliate me? Why are you doing this? So Tracy? And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard. Plenty of pep, too. Handles pretty good, don't you think? Anywhere you want. Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour. So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical? Good for you. Good for you Huh. Right. College. Wow. Where are you going? Where 'd you get into? Oh. New cars. I see. Well, you came to the right place So what brings you here? Hello, Tracy. That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done. We'll begin with president. That's enough, Tracy. Quit while you're ahead, okay? I'll handle this. Could you ask Walt to come in? You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed. Looks like today's your lucky day I agree. But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections. This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake. I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences. You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand. You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy. You have many admirable qualities. But someday maybe you'll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there's a lot more to life than that. And in the end, you're only cheating yourself. Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it? Whom should we "interrogate?" 6:30. How do you know what time the posters were torn down? Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend? A travesty. Huh. That's interesting, because I think you did it. I guess you know why you're here Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy? We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine. Looks like Tim Kobza. As far as I know, they-- Calm down, Tracy. Just calm down. So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life. Good luck, Tracy. Sure Yeah. Okay. well, good luck Tracy Should be easy. So far no competition. You bet. Okay, fine. Sure NO, that's fine Looks good to me. Right You can put those in my box. I'll look at them tomorrow. Hey, that's super Oh. There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know. Now at the end of her junior year, Tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body. And so far she was running unopposed. Tracy. Okay. But we're still missing something key here. What are we missing? Well, good luck there, Tracy Yes, I do. Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy? Oh yeah, you bet. Nowhere. I don't have class until second period. Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech. That's not what student government's about. Thanks. Well. I'm going home now. Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer. Oh. Okay. Hmm? Life would go on, and I would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience. I don't believe you. Which door? And how did you get in the school? Exactly when? And when did you do it? Looks at her skeptically doesn't say a word. What is it. Tammy? So... what do you have to tell me? Possibly. Please just wait outside. Just wait outside. Tammy. Me? I took advantage of you? You hugged me! You kissed me! You're the one who -- A mistake? That was no mistake. It's the only true thing I know anymore. Sherry... I love you. You're there. Three twenty-five. Right now? We'll let it run awhile Still clear? No, I... uh, didn't know that Shall we give it a name? points at the motel. So what do you think? Should we get a room? Oh, come on. You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time. Let go; live a little. Okay. Give me the drill. Here? Without Dave around. Sherry needed a lot of help around the house. Sure. After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce. Don't worry about Tracy. She'll be fine. Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later. A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home. Oh, no. No. I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home. Exactly. So what do you say? Maybe it's time to give a little something back. Fine. Let's say all you ever knew was apples. Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy. Okay, let's say takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard. Paul, what's your favorite fruit? Yeah. But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied. Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right. Let me give you a clue. You're a born leader. You're one of the most popular students at Millard. You're honest and straightforward. You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside. The other kids look up to you. What does that spell? But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity. I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports. I know. I understand disappointment. I really do. Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you. Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out. In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him? Gin? Where the hell are you? Where are you at least? Don't overestimate yourself. This is dangerous. I'm sending backup. How close? Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status? You don't call, you don't write. Which you have in mind. That's doable. How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me? With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue. Why didn't I think of that? You got a better idea? Exactly. Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac. And the draft blew over the flowers. Meaning-- You ordering chop suey again? Interesting theory. Where's the proof? That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high. So he popped the pane? The windows don't open. A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry. I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life. You didn't answer the beeper either. Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.You mean the seven billion. They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going. That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me. Both sides of the street, I'm afraid. You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you-- It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express. Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong. Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets. Put this on! I cannot get rid of you. Get out of here! Go! Come on. You can do it. I sincerely hope not. The disc is still in there. Don't panic, now, there's no rush... Relax, don't jam it... Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank. They'll each be positive the other guy did it. I fear an ugly international incident. And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about... Brought us luck once, maybe it will again. They drive so recklessly there. What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower? A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast. Seen one billion, seen them all. Oh, I don't care about the money. I'm sorry. Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy. Have really held you under? But that's all behind us now. That was a lifetime ago. Call it a new tradition. There is one more thing. You shouldn't have. No way to take another day or two? Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM? Packed. Charged. Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there. Can't be too careful. Like a woman of mystery. For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump. You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me. There's always a surprise. You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal. You can't be serious. So how long till we do this? You've thought of everything. Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me. It's no good without the argon gas. A parting gift from the Empire. But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer. And the money goes-- Where the money is. What's that? Right. The eight billion. Transfer. Well...What are we doing? What about the rules? I'd taken the Mask? Would you quiet down! Just for a minute? You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade. Idle hands, the devil's workshop. Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human. Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner. Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it. You've got everything planned. Hmmm...44 long. Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four? It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress. No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent-- If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split. Speaking of money. You said billions. How many? We're living history here. Get the hell in. What? There is no big job. It's your mistake. What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask. Okay, you're a thief. You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in. Now's when you tell me who you really are. The Mask. Careful...careful. Be careful not to break the laser beams. Behind you. Can you see the other PIRs? Ready? Yes, you can. You can spoil a perfectly nice dance. These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed. You're not on the beat. Let's mingle a little, shall we? We're working. Popup, on floorboards. And-- Camera in the-- He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody. So you had to be your own lifeline. Aren't we all. How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then? You were afraid of heights? You're nervous again. To our...partnership. Little celebration before we set off. Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen. Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it. It's not a village. There's nothing there. Thank you. Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share. I trust it's your size. One more item--not on the check list. Charged? The lipstick thermal camera? And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock. So how long to pop the floor? Yes you did. It was a long time ago. Our equipment has arrived. Try laps. Say a hundred. We are...for the tools. So you're testing me now? So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job. A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner. On what? Another job? Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we? No one needs anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want. You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before. The Rembrandt--that was quite good. True enough. I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name. Nice try. Everyone thinks I did. A lifelong problem, I'm afraid. This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room. Pack up. I'll see you get back to London. I go in alone. Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad. We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside? So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel. That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day. Only a week? Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end? I know it well. It is. Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes. Good morning. You're late. My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure. I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do. Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could. And-- Lose something? You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance? What's your problem? I'm doing the job. No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers. I'm a thief. Sue me. Certainly not mine. Come on. I never carry...baggage. I'm not the one to ask... We're only going one way. Got it. Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out. Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail. Damn, I knew I forgot something. That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket. Look on the back. What do you see? Can you follow simple directions? Give him the card. I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers. It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card. That's my girl. If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask? Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney. Very nice. Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes. Possibly. Oh? Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself. Roki has a vivid imagination. So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired. It's not for sale. That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back... The Empress Death Mask. For God's sake. Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth. Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you? Not interested. And I thought we were getting on so well. Oh, that's quite all right. No charge. Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way. You're shaking. Are you nervous? Of course I can. I have a note from mother. Do you mind? So what? Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously. I sincerely hope so. Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit. Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says. You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days. It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me. You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely. It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit. Seems I am. Meet me in front. Five minutes. You have a car? Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you. Then don't. Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please. You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it. How about if you try disappearing. I can't? A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes. Why are we speaking Chinese? That is of no interest. I have a question... Probably not. Yes it does. My friend, you always surprise me. I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer. The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality. Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not. You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag? What matters isn't what's real. It's what we think is real--what matters is the art. Call it an expression of trust. Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each. She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know. You'll just have to have faith. You know where my loyalties lie. It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now? She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is. She's calling the shots now. This is just show and tell. It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any. Check out my ball. I'm terribly sorry old man. Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter. Suspicious, after all these years? We're supposed to. Because it pays off. So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me. But the second mouse gets the cheese. It's too soon. You look like George Washington. I said a masked ball, not a costume party. Oh, it is. I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4. Black of course. I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga. Right. It's a death mask. Death mask means dead. It's never big enough. We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one. You are a miracle worker. If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient. We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC. The key to success is using the right tools. The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera? And you do it so well. I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good. Tina was a wonderful woman. Which is-- Next time I'll use valet parking.Yeah. Probably not. See you. I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill. Takes a lot out of you, one like this. We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her... Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died? You got a real problem with priorities, you know that? I figured that out. Thought you had to use some of these. You're giving them to me? Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust. To yourself, that's where. You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder. My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v. She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more. You're impressed with her, aren't you? I'm waiting for the tell part. That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind. Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad? Tonight your league night? You damn well thought wrong. You change partners, you change the rules. You better not be taking on a new partner. You two make quite a couple. Remind me why. The early bird gets the damn worm. I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight. How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference? It better be worth it for me. This better be worth 1t. That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper. Because I never assume anything. Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive? This is big enough. Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days. Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable. You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner? Had to get a liquid plasma screen. Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries. Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it. In the van. They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack. I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.No! Look at you! You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things... Get your hands off him! Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?! This is a man... ! You killed him! What... ? Right, right. Where's Tyler? You are a moron. Look at my face. I'm a member. I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden. There's no one else here. I need to know where Tyler is. Can't you help me? Yeah, both of us. Look at my face. Bob, Bob... I'm a member. Oh. Really, what's that? Really? Great. Still "Remaining Men Together?" Bob. I'm okay. How are you? Strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one. Bob was a champion bodybuilder. You know that chest expansion program you see on TV? That was his idea. Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed. Then hormone therapy. He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big. Yes. We're men. Men is what we are. This was a support group for men with testicular cancer. The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob. What about this? Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant. In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut. I won't need to come to the office. I can do this job from home. Let's pretend. You're the Department of Transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects? Brake linings that fail after a thousand miles. Fuel injectors that burn people alive. I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise. We need to talk. "Abuse" the copy machine. There's an image. Hmm? I must've left the original in the copy machine. Some of it, yes. Yes. After fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down. You can deal with anything. He was full of pep. Must've had his grande latte enema. You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade? It must've been Tuesday. he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie. I'd like to thank the academy... No. No, sir. I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me. The dishes were me. The plants were... Who do you think could've done this? This is... really a shock... What does that mean? Dynamite? Yes, sire, strange. Very strange. I am Jack's Cold Sweat. No, I wasn't aware... Yes? I'm in pain. Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals. Can't you give me something? Maybe I died already. Look at my face. I did, I think. But, I'm okay... I'm fine... Yes. Don't ask. Yes, fine. Just, get on. Stay away a couple of weeks, at least. I can't let myself see where you're going. Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities... I'm begging you. Get on the bus. Get on the bus. Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again. Here... here... Do this for me, Marla. Do this for me, if you never do anything else... I'm sorry, but I... Marla... You have to get out of here. Leave as soon as possible. Go to any rural town, away from any major city... I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger. I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me. I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you... I deserve that. Anyway, I've... I've only just realized I know that I've been... unwell. I know it's been like there's two sides to me. Because... I'm Tyler Durden. Absolutely, you have every right. I need you to do me a favor. Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds. Marla... I need to talk to you. It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out. I'm sorry, I... Marla... Marla, no, wait... Say my name! What's my name!? Say my name. What did you say... ? We've just lost cabin pressure. Answer the question! We did make love? Will you just answer me, for Christsake?! Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?" Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex? He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away! He's not here. The Paper Street Soap Company. Let go of me... Leave me alone. Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?! ... A person. No. That... sawing and hammering. You hear that? I don't understand. Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto? I don't know. When? Really... I mean it. Have you been going to your groups? You... don't have to... leave. Uh ... nah. I think everything's okay here. No... no problem. Nothing. Okay. Okay, I'm sure. No. Here. There? Where? Here? No, thanks. This is a sweet side of you. Picking these up for ... "Mrs. Haniver" and... "Mrs. Raines." Where are they? She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book. I don't know ... What are you talking about? Goodbye. It's time for you to leave. It suits you. Worth every penny. Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room. What the hell are you doing here? What are you doing here? So you're staying in tonight? This could go on for hours. Picture yourself watching Marla Singer throw herself around her crummy apartment. I'm just on my way out... Look, this is a bad time... It's for men. I found a new one. That's the idea -- we split them. How did you find me? Marla? In case we want to switch nights. Um... Marla, should we maybe exchange numbers? Let's not make a big thing out of it. We'll split it. You get it the first and third Sunday of the month. The girl had done her homework. Then, take blood parasites. It's yours. Now we each have three. You can't have the whole brain! Okay. I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia -- You can't have both parasites. You can take blood parasites -- You're kidding. I think testicular cancer should be no contest. We'll split up the week. You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and -- Please. Can't we do something... ? Look, I can't cry with a faker present. It becomes an addiction. Yeah. I... I don't know. I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead... Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back. These are my groups. I was here first. I've been coming for a year. Why are you doing this? I'll expose you. Practicing what? Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying. But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying. I'm on to you. You're a faker. You aren't dying. We need to talk. ... and you come home to this. Well... let me see... here's the thing... I just called a second ago. There was no answer. I'm at a payphone. Uh... I'm sorry. We met on the plane. We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy. Tyler? Hello? Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position. Who do you think I am? What? Yes... it's a test. ... You know me? I had everything in that bag. My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes... My suitcase was vibrating? Excuse me? "Throwers?" You're a tourist. I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer. If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla. Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't. -- But, in here, in everyone, there's the squint of a five-day headache. Yet they forced themselves to be positive. They never said "parasite;" they said "agent." They always talked about getting better. I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around. My eyes are open. Look at me... Appreciate something. Do something for me. It's the only way to get rid of you... Not my mouth. Our mouth. What have you left for me? I swear on my life, I won't... Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler. Why are you doing this?! ... no, no, no... Noooo, please... No, no, I don't. I thank you, I really do. Thank you, but I don't need you anymore. Why can't I get rid of you? Why can't I just wish you away? Why... why... why... ? How'd you do that?! You're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state... NO... Not exactly according to plan. Paraffin. Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. I saw it floating in the bomb. Paraffin. Please... Can't you call it off... ? i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... I think this is about where we came in. Yes. Defuse the bomb, please. Defuse the bomb. Tyler... I quit. Fuck your struggle. I want out. Bob is dead, Tyler. The police blew a hole in his head. Was that part of your plan? Fuck you. Yes... I'm pulling the green wire. If I'm wrong, we're both dead.. If you know, I know. You don't know that. There could still be people inside. Since when is Project Mayhem about murder? Stop finishing... I'm not going... I'm going to... I can't let you... You... you can't be serious about this. She's... you... you're fucking her. What about Marla? You have jobs. You took me to the house. Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat? No! This isn't true. We... we were around other people, together, both of us... What... what are you saying? This isn't possible... Oh, yeah. I didn't really know my Dad... He's not here! Tyler's not here anymore! He's gone away! The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club. What are you talking about... ? What... ? I don't know! Tell me! Answer me, Tyler. Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden? Why do people think I'm you? What's this all about, Tyler? "Training?" Tyler... "Applicant?" "Too young?" Wait a minute... ... is over. This conversation... Nothing. What? Fuck my life. Fuck fight club. Fuck you and fuck Marla. I'm sick of this. How's that? I would feel nothing about my life? Is that what you want to hear?! I don't know! Nothing! I don't think that's true. I'm not asking you to. What the hell ... ?! Tyler... What are you doing?! I want to know -- Look... You know what I mean. Why wasn't I involved from the beginning? You and I started fight club together. Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?" No. I felt like destroying something beautiful. Hey. I feel sick. Tell him! Tyler... What is it? What are we doing? I thought you did. Local 8 just started in Penns Grove. And, Bob said he was at fight club in Newcastle last week. There's fight club in Delaware City. Okay, and... and... Six months advance pay. Six months! What... ? Work. Going to work. You quit? ... Marla ... ? We don't... ? It isn't... ? I don't know... No, I'm not... I... I think I understand. I think I get it... I was going to my cave to find my power animal. Guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this. Tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand. Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts. What is this place? You get rid of her. Shhhhhh! I don't know what to make of this, sir, I really don't... Huh? Uh... nah... I said I promise! Yes, I promise. Okay. What? She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home. Marla doesn't need a lover. She needs a case worker. Oh, and my pace is more librarians. I'm fine. Yeah, I'm sure. No. Not at all. He was obviously able to handle it. You? Okay... Ghandi. Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails. Shatner. William Shatner. Doesn't matter. If you could fight any celebrity? A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough. After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood. Show-off. What are you reading? "I am Joe's Lungs." It's written in first person. "Without me, Joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells." There's a whole series -- "I am Joe's Prostate." What? The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in. I don't know how Tyler found the house, but he'd been there for half a year. Where's your car? Same here. I know that. Oh, yeah. I didn't know my dad. Well, I knew him, till I was six. He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family. My boss, probably. Who would you fight? Anyone? What fight? Call what off? Is it? Strange. Shit. Sorry. That didn't count. Where do you want it? In the face? This is crazy. Me? No. That's a good thing, isn't it? I don't know about this. You get the idea. He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well... He was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry. Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work. No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did. In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution... It affords him other interesting opportunities. It's called a "changeover." The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea. What? What's that? Thank you. Can I stay at your place? Would that be a problem? No, I... Huh? I don't follow... Yeah. God, it's late. I should find a hotel... Don't I? Well, I have to file a claim... I don't... think so. What list? Insurance'll cover it. Delivered from Martha Stewart. Delivered from Swedish furniture. ...no ...no ... There's always that. All gone. I guess so. You buy furniture. You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need. No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled. Then, the right set of dishes. The right dinette. Well, uh... great. What? Thank you. You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained-- I mean -- for a living. What do you do, Tyler? No, supply oxygen? This is how I met -- Pardon me? Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer. We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction. The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin. In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble. I know this because Tyler knows this. That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way. ... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin... Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?! Abort the plan. Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed... Excuse me? Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible... Who is this? No! Robert Paulson is dead. He's dead, because of you... No! Wrong! This man's name is Robert Paulson. No, no. This is a man -- this man has a name... What he wanted? Look... look at him. Look at him! What does he want? This is a person. This is not a cog in your machine...What? What? What? Why are you going with this, Ikea- boy? Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth? What are you doing? You will. You know you will. If I leave, you will be right back where I found you... I'm doing this for us. No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together. From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart... Look, I can be selfish, I know that. I'm not blind to my own failings... You need me. Why what? Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination. Proceed with remote detonation. Do we have to do everything ourselves?! Damn it! God-damn it... What? What the fuck -- ? Fifteen seconds now. Can you see alright? 10... 9... 8.... It's out of our hands. This is it. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. One minute. Defuse the bomb? Ask me nicely. What? Not an option, for the most obvious of reasons. You need to get with the program. Seven minutes. Let's get out of here. You want out? Bob was a grown man. In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name? Project "Mayhem." I've got everything. The bombs. The army. I've got Marla. I'm serious. That's the wrong one. Don't pull the green wire. Pull anything but the green wire. Green? Did you say green? This is not about martyrdom. I wouldn't be doing that. Unless you know which wires, in what order... The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago. Everything's proceeding exactly as planned. What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants? We both use that body. ...your sentences! They're our sentences. Get your mind around that. ...to let this happen! ...stop me? ...go through with this? What are you going to do? What a ridiculous thing to say. You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be... Um, well... technically, no. What about Marla? Night jobs -- while you were sleeping. The house is rented in your name. What about them? They're lunatics. You never talked to me in front of anyone else. It's okay. We okay... a little codependent, sure, but... We're going to have to do something about Marla... There! Happy? I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise. Now look what you've done! But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you... You can see me and hear me, but no one else can... And, sometimes you control it... Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me... Is this really news to you? People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body. Why do people think anything? Why did you do that? You broke your promise. You talked to her about me. And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South. Four in Milwaukee. If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training. If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young. Old, too old. Fat, too fat. You're too young. Sorry. ... is over. What are you talking about? Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat! It's not a seminar! You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me. Why do you think I blew up your condo? I want to hear the truth. If you died right now, how would you feel about your life? You're asking questions that don't have answers. You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else. You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you. We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world. We are all part of the same compost heap... This does not belong to us. We are not the leaders. We are not special. What do you want to know about Project Mayhem? Should I E-mail you? Should I put this on your "action item list?" What do you want? A statement of purpose... ? Is this a needlepoint club? Is it about you and me? Fight club was the beginning. Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem. What should I have told you? Something on your mind? Where did you go, Psycho-Boy? Hey. Imagine how he feels. I asked you what you studied. An expired community college student ID card. What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel? Homework assignment. Newcastle? Did you start that one? I heard. Local 15, Monday nights. Fucking sweet. Nothing. Do what you like. Yeah. Where you headed? No thanks, I quit. Fuck damnation. Fuck redemption. We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it. We don't need him... Listen to me. You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you. In all probability, He hates you. This is not the worst thing that can happen... Shut up. Our fathers were our models for God. And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God? This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it. No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment. Stop it. This is your pain -- your burning hand. It's right here. Look at it. Look at your hand. This clear layer in glycerin. We'll mix it back in when we make the soap. As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface. Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts. A liposuction clinic. Don't mention me. "The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception." You want to finish her off? That was three times you promised. Promise? Promise you won't. If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out. And you'll never see me again. Promise me. You've gotta understand something about me. I have a little rule, okay? Don't ever talk to her about me. Ever. I can't stand that kind of shit. Listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute... She needs an exorcist. This isn't love. This is sport-fucking. Hey... don't knock librarians. She is a wild, twisted bitch. Stay away from that one. You're okay with this? Good. This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that... You're sure? I mean, this girl... uh, you're not into her or anything... ? Unbelievable, huh? Abe Lincoln. Big reach. Skinny guys fight till they're burger. Good answer. Any historical figure. Hemingway. You? Alive or dead? Soldier of Fortune. Business Week. New Republic. "I get cancer, and I kill Joe." Oh, a new riot control grenade... "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..." Hum. What car? A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need. After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?" He said, "Get a job." When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?" He said, "I don't know. Get married." He was setting up franchises. My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go. My dad. No question. Anyone. If you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight? This fight, pussy. The fight. We've crossed the threshold. You want to call it off? But a good strange. How do you feel? Like hell. That counted. Surprise me. Alright, go crazy. Let 'er rip. Why not you? I'm letting you go first. Do it. I don't want to die without any scars. How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked. I don't know, either. I want to find out. I've never been hit, have you? Go ahead. Say it. ... Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Don't watch. I can't if you watch. A nice, big cock. One-forty-eighth of a second. That's how long it's up there. -- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films. Why would anyone want this shitty job? They're called "cigarette burns." I want you to hit me as hard as you can. I want you to hit me as hard as you can. You're welcome. But, I want you to do me one favor. Yes, you can. Is it a problem for you to ask? Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place? You called me so you could have a place to stay. We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me. So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel? A hotel? Do what you like. The things you own, they end up owning you. This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks. The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list. That list. Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list. Delivered from bullshit colors like "Cobalt," "Ebony," and "Fuchsia." Delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns. But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered. I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit. The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right? I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a terrible tragedy. Could be worse. A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car. And, now it's gone. This is how we fill up our lives. Keep it up, then. Keep it right up. Being clever. How's that working out for you? The spork. I get it. You're very clever. Why? So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it? What do you want me to do? Oxygen gets you high. In a catastrophic emergency, we're taking giant, panicked breaths... You know why they have oxygen masks on planes? Tyler Durden. Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola. Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick. Look what we've accomplised. Thirty seconds. It's getting exciting now. One minute. This is the beginning. We're at ground zero. Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion. Thank you. Thank you, sir... We need some towels, Lou. We need replacement light bulbs. Pleeeeeease! You and your friend. You're welcome to join our club. Yes, it is. It's free to all. There is no money. We have a deal worked out with Irvine. Would you rather be dead? Stuff. That means you have to get more schooling. Animals. What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel? Why? "Stuff." Were the mid-terms hard? Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face. Is this a picture of Mom and Dad? They give basement apartments letters instead of numbers. Raymond, you're going to die. Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A. A small, cramped basement apartment.And how the hell are we going to do that? How much more do they need than your death at his hands? It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger -- -- bullshit -- -- Price killed her, there's no other explanation -- Not yet. It's complicated. But don't worry -- -- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise." "But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him -- Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection -- Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady. Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary. I'm confused. Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either. If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn -- If you don't calm the hell down I'm gonna strap you in for electro-shock! Jesus H. Christ! Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago?? Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem? I'm moved beyond words. More of Price's spook-house bullshit. If you don't mind me asking... Who are you? Don't think it'll be a problem. Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police -- No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him. Something just must've...frightened her, that's all. Oh, for chrissake -- More to the point. Where's our host? If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation. Oh, really: who? -- what was he doing here? I'm sorry -- I don't know!! Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed. Three times, to be exact. Is she alright? Ms. Marr! There must be some other way out. I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name -- Donald W. Blackburn, M.D. What are you playing here, Price? I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind. -- I did: down here. Yeah, me too. Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems -- If this is someone's idea of a joke -- Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.You sure? You'll be alright by yourself? Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case? And I think that's case -- Yeah, what the hell, I'll go. -- fuck you! This thing's going nowhere. As a tumor. Pritchett! Pritchett, is that you? If you know where it is, get there! It's not going to let us out! What? Oh. Jesus. How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations? Shit, Pritchett!!! What's down there? -- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett! Hey! Where'd you guys go? Did it work? So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay? What is it? What's in there? What's in there? -- well, let's hear it for small miracles -- So, what? You're saying we're stuck here the rest of our lives? You said that was an accident. You're totally full of shit, aren't you? 'Less the place really is haunted. I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy. -- closed. -- the stained glass -- Oh, Jesus.... Prove it. Best of a nightmare. Take the gun. This is nuts. And we get this money when? Jesus! Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett. You okay? What -- Where did it go? It's succeeding! For chrissake give me a hand! What -- Don't think it's even an issue. It's okay, everything's okay now. Price!! This is the best we're gonna do. That's crazy! Wait a minute... What are you saying? Better living through electricity. What are you looking for? Good point. I think we should have taken a right back there. -- you lose either way, Price -- -- that's the fact, bud -- -- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop. No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store -- Sure, with three days and a blowtorch. You hear somebody? And then where are we? What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us? How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome? Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air! Not in the movie biz. So, c'mon, gimme the truth. Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close. I don't think so... Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there. Most fun I've had all day. Why? I'm better than that. I thought she was dead. For sure. Then what the hell are we doing here? Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service. So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that? Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something. You've got your own TV show? ...Jesus H. Christ.I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation! Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown. Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody -- Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter -- -- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain! Where is it?? Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn. Excuse me? Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife. What? Melissa! Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together. Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby? -- I'm sure you did. You're not my list. Just for the record: what are the rest of your names? A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket. Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party? -- yeah, we did that -- Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have -- Prove it how? Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs. Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it. I'll meet you down there. Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not "comfortable" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying. The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions? Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash. Evelyn... Get up... NOW! No... -- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby -- -- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure -- -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak -- They weren't loaded when I put them in there! Jesus! -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive -- If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last -- -- I pose you the same question -- Asking the wrong person again. Where is she? A simple leak, if it's okay with you. Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart. What are you talking about? -- in the act. Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch -- Huh. And here I had a completely different theory. -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it. Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July. I know. -- just not always in the sexual sense. You know everything you do gets me hot. You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time! Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that? Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn? You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo. Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited. Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers. Oh, I think we're going to have several. You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart. And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin! I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia. -- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown. Maybe if I -- Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!! I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine. I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe. I think it's something better experienced then described. Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top? Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness. My wife. Where were we? He was right! Pritchett was right! Or somebody wanting me to believe that. Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum. I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons -- What? Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow. -- even if I give you a million as well? I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime -- Sorry, Pritchett, here you go. Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing. She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett? Please! I need your help. Then tell me, please -- help me...! -- listen to me, goddamnit -- -- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right -- Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive -- Well, I can't, sweetheart. Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber." I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon. Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement? I was upstairs! -- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn -- I think I'll do what I damn well please. Something with the power, I don't know!! I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn. Sorry. -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young -- Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you. Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living. You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you. Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War. No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it. It works. Then who did?? Rewind that. I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just... -- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that! So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer. Problem where? Looked good to me. Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.Oh dear. It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first. Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do? Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello?? Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind." Not at all! Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So... Over here! Up here -- Me? You've gotta be kidding. Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing! Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now. Uhhhh... Poor Mr. Price -- What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...? Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance. The...Fourth of July. Yes. Left, goddamnit! New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy." Hell NO!! The House will kill ya! The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father... Nothing. -- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then. A cleaning crew's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- I think the power of the house fades at dawn. I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die. You'll never know 'til you walk through that door! Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents. I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to -- I am. Vannacutt!! -- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry. House 2, Guests 0. I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere! I think...I may have the answer. Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive! And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out. Wouldn't know what to do with it all -- -- my loss -- -- it's getting older by the second. Mr. Price, if I could just please have -- I'm ready now. I can't remember at the moment. -- ten. He must've unsealed the room! Oh, dear. He would have been back by now. Blackburn's dead. I thought you understood.... It's the souls of Vannacutt's dead... The insanity... The horror... Victims burned alive... All that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years... ...singing this will be the day that I die... This will be the day that I.... This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then... ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie... Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me. Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house... I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931. You'll never find it, it's a maze down there. The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there. Believe me, we need to. Won't do any good. Hasn't been a telephone in this House in over 60 years. Don't know that it does. Oh, no. I can't comment until I get paid. He must've beaten us all here! Wish I could take the credit, but -- It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!I'm trying !!! No . If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry. And even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide. He's not gonna hurt me . I need to see his habitat. 'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in. It happens when I land. And law enforcement, such dangerous work. The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity. You're a beautiful woman. I don't know! I see blood. Maybe you got him, Hank. No! Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine. This is a grand beast. A grand dragon . An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive. So profound and fat. Then do it!! That sounds good but underneath it's hurtful. Nightcap? Sobek. Half man, half croc, oldest God-- Just spit him back out. Some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know? What's that? Bite my bishop . Maybe he doesn't play well with others. Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet. Promise you won't kill me, first. This is a setback. I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless. Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better. Was he a good man? No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log. What I'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him. Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt. No crocodile has ever-- They don't really attack underwater and-- This could end up saving your life,-- I keep telling you, they can come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night-- I'm laying a spring trap! What are you doing?! Jesus Christ!! Deep down, gut check. I'm growing fond of you and it's liberating to say so. And you like me. Could she stay, we've tentatively scheduled intercourse. They come on land and they're brazen. They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it. Cocktail? Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile. Bury your friend. Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species. If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away. Crocs hang around the food source. They can survive winter. As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive, am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name? They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time. C'mon, we're losing light, why does the big one heckle me? They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,-- I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout, you've had work done. I'll need any and all topographic studies. Women's intuition. Are there anymore? You talk to Bickerman? No . Look. He's got nothing left. Where is he? Thank you, Jack. Radar, he's underwater. But he's definitely coming. Thirty meters or so. Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie. I got something on the screen. You ready on shore? Right. That's actually the easy part. We both know what they'll do. Jack. We've all seen it. He's probably a hundred and fifty years old, he's bigger than an elephant. Look. I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it. They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,-- I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out. And I think I know a way to-- Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe-- Bastard bit my chopper. He never said "go". At school they'd always say "go" first. And Hank. I know you weren't really trying to hit him. He's gonna live? Guess I finally got bit. I'm okay. We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs. They won't. He's taken human life, the mission will be to put him down. They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans. Tranq him in water, he drowns. Could we have intercourse? Yes. You may. But maybe... I don't know... Eh. Fuck it. Didn't even sound good? I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack-- With crocodiles... everything's even. Nothing's real. I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and-- Nothing's real. You think I'm that nuts? I'm a civilian! You don't have any authority-- Are you sure? As if. Will you miss me? Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count. And what if I tranq him Kelly? He drowns. You think about that? Such the flirt. What's going on? 'Cept he wasn't before, was he? You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat. Even so, you're allowed to boast. You look thin by the way, I've mentally undressed you, I can see your ribcage. If he's here, I'll find him. Did she tell you we had sex together? That hurt my feelings.We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am. He just appeared . You have no idea how he arrived in this lake? You killed him. Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake. Do you know how your husband died? Just those two. She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off. You take care. Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger-- Tranq guns down, rifles up! You shoot on my order. If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off. And drive fast, they can move on land. You set? Almost here, Hector. Don't forget to lift up the cow. Okay. Lead him in. Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide. Everybody up on the trucks . Can you confirm visually or just radar? Where? Where? You do? We're ready. The more he thrashes, the better. Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim. And again. How would you get him on land? So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to-- No way. Forget it . Well, you can try talking them into that, if-- 'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid-- Hey!! This time, I'm gonna kick your ass. Get the gun. Get your big gun and guard the shore. Hector. Go to your tent. That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can. Worth a try. We don't wanna be alone forever, do we? So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up. Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world. You found anyone in yours? It was... something meeting you. Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... If I'm ever in New York... You sure? I don't mind... You wanna ride in my truck? Get him onto shore. I don't care. Hank. End it. Back us in a little, we need to get a shot! Take him. Keep firing! You wouldn't? Hector. He doesn't seem to be swimming. Is he swimming? He looks like a giant tea bag. It can't work. We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter. Are we crazy? We might as well pack. Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game. They should be here by four. No ! You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and-- You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide? Look. Calm down . Calm down. Really-- Okay. Okay. Okay. You're mushing it a little around the-- Maybe. Don't mush it. I heard something. Ssssh! We could not say it and... Well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to... Well. Goodnight. Thanks for the... bandaid. That's why you're here. To get in the middle of something? You're having the best time of your life, aren't you? Thank you. No thanks. Who taught you be be a nurse? Ow . Shit. Sorry. Let's get away from the shore. I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth? Like little children. You okay? But why Maine and why alone? Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself? Just forget it. I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science. I didn't say it like that. Forgive me for trying to be nice. I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good. When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's... in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie. You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion. I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints. Are you okay? Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster. They just want us to sit tight. No. U.S. Wildlife is on their way. You okay? Kelly? Good. See ya soon. He thinks they're what? 'Night. Okay. We're up at six. I'm sorry but you're... You flew up here because your boss-- It's too dangerous for-- Whatever's out there did flip over a canoe-- Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore. What are you doing? He could be right there and you wouldn't see him. If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible? Baby crocs? Well until we see it, we're not gonna be convincing too many people. Same thing from Fish And Game. In Maine? Who? What? Well. You don't have to stay out here , why don't-- You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods-- And even if they did , I doubt he or she would have problems with tents . The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to-- Why are you here? Really. Never been to Maine before? Hank says he's sure. Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in water . On land maybe. But... Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well. Did you make anything of the tooth? Jack Wells. A museum sent you? You too. Don't count on it. We better take him out. Hector. Do not move . If you get a safe shot... Where is he?! Even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land. You gotta be kidding . They won't be here till at least noon. We got a few hours to kill. Get back from the shore. We know how fast he can leap out. You said nobody came in here! Hank. The little cannon you brought, get it. Guard the shoreline. Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished. They look like they're jumping. Are they feeding? What's that? You gonna dig up that lady's husband? Let's go. We set?Go ahead. You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest. Ma'am, how could you not report this? He puts human life at risk and-- Ma'am. Your husband, Bernie. You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded? Oh, but you have , Ma'am. You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice. A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows. And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am? My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman. Where is he?! I just have this feeling everything's totally safe. Gee, that would really disappoint me. You probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker. I can arrest you!! Raincheck. I'm tired, Hector. I know this because you're beginning to not bug me. He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear. It came from across the lake. Is everything a big fucking joke to you? Asia? How... how could he get here? I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector. Could you please cut me down? You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you. His head was just... bitten off. Yup. I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck. Is this a trick? Again. Not to be disruptive. Do we have a problem with it dying? That "Walt" guy got hit underwater-- Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions. But if it is a crocodile which I don't think it is. And if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds... why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time? With you it makes sense. I coulda shot you, you-- A spring trap! You're crawling around like a-- What the hell are you doing?!! I do not like you. You listen to me. The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar-- No!! Out! Everybody out, back to your tents, now ! No !! What's with digging the holes? We are here on official business. Keystone what? We'd only just met. Around here. Yeah. And what would he do come winter? I really don't mean to be discourteous. But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England? Mr. Cyr! Wait just a second. You don't just fly in here and start barking orders. -- Who is he ? Thanks for your help. He's done. He's dying. I'll take it! I can't. I'll get Hector!! Other than to eat us? Now I'm gonna puke. So does he. We shouldn't even really be doing this. Obviously I was wrong! Alright, Ms. Paleontologist. I wanna know why that monster is here. You got a theory? Doesn't look like it. White perch. I'll call the coroner. Half mile up, there's a clearing. I'm ready when you are. Ready. A museum in New York sent us some additional back up. I guess. Should I? I don't know. Back the truck-- That it's about to go wrong. They're coming right in. She's worried about the cow now. What? Look. He said he knew Karate! Other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I'm perfectly fine. Could you cut me down? Yes. Are you alright? I don't know. It was like a tug. Something tugged us. Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home. I'm just curious. I can never tell what women think is handsome. Is he handsome? You think Jack's handsome? Hector thinks you like him. You like Jack? And that's why he thinks they're Godly? Was that like a homo-sexual remark? Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies. Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious? Apologize ? They don't believe her. With what? I just let go of it. Hey!! I thought I saw... What the hell? I told you. Two days, we'd have to camp. The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up. They wanted to call it Lake Placid. But somebody said that name was taken. Was he swallowed? You're sort of a rude person. Lightweight Forward Area air device unit. Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead. I got nothing against-- Sorry. I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here. We ? Not yet. Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake. Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual. Yes. Seconds. Three, four. This is a little different. Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott? I wouldn't. That's where they keep them. You want me to bring the tooth out here? Yes. The lake was dead calm until up he came. The tooth is in there. He just kinda gurgled. He was pretty much dead. He just came up screaming.Kelly -- It has nothing to do with-- Well on this one I'd like you to be. Part of our research-- Kelly-- I'd like you to check out this lake. See-- I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I-- I want you to go there. A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear. They say it looks prehistoric. Like maybe a dinosaur. This is business. There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake. Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth. Hey. It's ten after nine. A jerk. Else. The somebody else part? I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix. You work for me. I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"... I had a great time last night. Again. Hi. Listen. Could I steal you a second? Kelly.Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma -- Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father -- Hey, Janet, it's Chad. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do -- Sure is. So why call me? It was scary though. Oh, she's fine. My mother had breast cancer. What kind of Cancer? Well I'm not sure why you're calling me. Uh-huh. Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name. I'm here, I'm listening. Well what's the situation? I'm really only equipped to take orders -- It is.

Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know -- Nope. So what'd they find out in there? No school today. My teacher got sick. You wanna take my statement, I'll perform for you, gotta get paid though, gotta get PAID.

I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE. I don't know. I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what? Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this. I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces. Oral surgery. Corrective teeth surgery. It doesn't matter. I want a shot of tequila too. Diet Coke. yeah, yes, hi, hello. -- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question. I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form. "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids! Full of useless thoughts, eh?" Thank you. Thank you. And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us." And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT. Brad, I know you don't love me now -- You mind your own bussines. I love you. I love you and I'm sick. I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow. I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow. For my teeth. For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces. Me too. Me too. I'm getting braces, too. For you. For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money. And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad. I love you, Brad. Brad the Bartender. You wanna love me back? Love me back and I'll be good to you. I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson. That's right. That's the first time you're right. I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE. I'm sick and I'm in love. I'm sick. You see? I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes.... "If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids? I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid. Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see? I will. -- and lemme tell you this: Samuel Johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money? His parents? His mommy and daddy? Make him live this life like this -- "A man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? It hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what -- "The" cause of dullness in others -- -- Samuel Johnson. I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid. What? You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv -- What? What does that mean? ....do you know who I am? My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give. No. I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love. I have love. -- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy. Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....? Is it real love? Do you have love in your heart? Just throw some money around. Money, money, money. You look like you've got money in your pocket. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS! I've been a good worker, Solomon. A hard and loyal -- I don't know. I've been a good worker -- It's...doesn't matter.... Yes I do. Yes. Braces. Solomon, please. Please. I am so fucked here if you do this. This is the worst timing. The worst timing I could ever imagine. I need to keep working. I have so many debts, so many things, I have, I have, I have -- I have surgery -- I have my oral surgery coming -- I paid you back. I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly -- I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me -- Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what? I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident. I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault. This is so fucked, Solomon. I don't deserve this. ...please.......getthat on the tv....there... She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee? He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...? Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that? So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know? I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see? Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..." This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something..... Gimme a cigarettee? No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in? She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?" "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..." My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that? What is that? When you get to the end? ...Lily...? Do you know Lily? Phil..do you know her? that'snotmy name...find Lily, gimmme that, give it -- ...find him on the...Frank. His name's Frank Mackey -- This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing: -- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere... Jack. I wanna see this...where is he, do you know? ...gimme that fuckin' phone... ...I can't hold onto this anymore... You got it. Do me a personal favor -- ...cocksucker.... Other fuckin' assholes like me. "yeah." the fuck do you know? Time lines, y'know? I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know? ....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes -- ...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one... She's a good girl. She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy. And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda? Get a girlfriend. I don't know...I mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but I don't know...he's a tough one...very.... Do you have a girlfriend, Phil? ...ah... ...no...no goddamn use. I have a son, y'know? Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.-- fuck you. You requested my time and I gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. And you say, "If I'd known I wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack? Well, I don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word. I gave you my time, Bitch. So fuck you now. Time's up. Thank you for the interview. I'm quietly judging you. What am I doing? And that's what you've heard? Go ahead and waste your time. An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill? Mm. Hm. I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me. I'm not sure I hear a question in there? This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- Not really. -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself into -- In aid of what? Yes. -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of? Thank you, Muffy. Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over -- So boring, so useless -- Is that still lingering? Muffy -- coffee? I warned you -- I get on a roll... I just realized this is for television, isn't it? I can't swear up and down like I just did. -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this: That there is no need for insight or understanding. Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is? I'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values. GOD DAMN I'M GOOD. There is no need for INSIGHT. There is no need for UNDERSTANDING. I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language. The "listener-patient" settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new. The System's state. What did I do? I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn. I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- Like I said, yeah -- -- go, go, go. I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey. If anything, there are women out there that want to destroy me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me." So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time. Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey. Can I have a cigarette? Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways. You got us a room so quick? Are we gonna tape some stuff now? Are you asking me a question? I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there. But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World. Defining It. Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine. You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not? he.he.he. no, no, no. Certainly not. I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear? Oh, yeah. No, no, no. They wouldn't -- "Frank" was my mother's father. My mother's name, actually. Good question. You've done you're research. What name? My name? I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled. I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what was as opposed to I wanted . ...this close... Right. From '84 to '89. Not a problem. people die. He passed away. "Go Get 'Em, Honey." She's my mother. She's retired. Well I guess it doesn't. My father worked in televison. My mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian. Hollywood, mainly. Around here. ...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say... I'm here. I'm here now. What do you want? Do you want anything? Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little... So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean: Mmm. Uh. huh. Oh yeah. He's in here --? Uh. huh. .....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said -- When did he go off chemo? How long...you think? ...uh-huh... Is he in pain? Uh-huh. What's going on? How long have you taken care of him? Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay? Yeah let's...maybe just stand. Is Linda here? I got your message. That you were trying to get me -- right? ...are you Phil...?please, what is it, please -- I won't say, no, wait, Claudia -- What? Yes I do. Say what you want and you'll see -- I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you. It's ok. It's ok. I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you.... I'm sorry -- I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people. I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me. I lost my gun. -- no, like what, what do you mean? Yeah, of course. Yeah. Well. ok. -- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much -- ...nothing. I'm sorry... It's fine. -- no, no, it's fine. Fine. You really use strong language. Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..." Let's make a deal. ...yeah... ok. No, no. I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with. Well I don't go out very much. Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something. They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them -- Bye. Oh, see? This is great. Ten o'clock. Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's? No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night -- What about ten o'clock, is that too late? I don't get off and then -- No, I'm off tonight. I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time? What time? Yeah. I don't know. I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it. I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door. No. Please, yes. No, no. I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date. I'm sorry, Claudia. Bye, bye, Claudia. Just Jim. Ok, then. Keep your chin up and your music down, alright? No. No. Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia. Please, now. Well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee -- This is my job. What's that stand for? This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia -- Okey-doke. But I wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face! I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance. It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help. Now there are certain measures you can take -- Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 -- The gentleman who came to the door -- Is this boyfriend bothering you? Arlight, then. Cheers. That'd be fine. So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud: They're incovenienced by that. If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok? Oh, it'll be fine, I'm sure, Claudia. That's great, thank you. I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup -- got some coffee brewing, huh? You and your boyfriend have a party last night? I'm a bit of a slob myself. Bit messy. You just move in here? Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok? You mind if I check things back here? Who was it? You don't have a boyfriend? Was it a boyfriend of yours? I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music. Has there been some screaming and yelling? You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually? And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand? Well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears. -- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears? Did you hear what I said? Ok. Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf? Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok? No one else in there with you? ...yeah... OPEN THE DOOR. It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please? LAPD. Open the door. Claudia What? What's your name? You live alone? You mind if I come in, check things? You alone in there? -- you the resident here? -- and I'm through playin' games. I was listening -- Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T. Finish it up without the lip. Alright, alright, cut it, coolio. That's enough with the mouth and the language. -- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word -- Go. Hurry up. Let's go. Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it. Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall? Oh, you're a rapper, huh? You got a record contract? Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes? You wanna disrespect an officer of the law? Ok. Listen. You: c'mere. No Can Do. That's confidential information, little man. They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school? Why the hell aren't you in school? Sorry, little man. You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok? I think it's more complicated than that little man. What the hell is this Marcie? -- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now. Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now -- This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up -- This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air -- Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay -- No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch -- --- What was that? Been drinkin' today? You on any medication? Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok? Mischief. Now have you been doin' some drugs today? Yes I can, Marcie. And until you start givin' me some straight answers: I'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here. Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me. The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something. You just woke up. And what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks? What's this, how did this happen? And what about screaming? Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash. I'm not askin', Marcie. Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me? Ok. What's your name? Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now? Are you lyin' to me? OK. That's true. Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house? No one else in here? No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here? You're not calm. You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here? Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down. Then you've got nothin' to worry about. I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on -- I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance -- Calm down. The door was open, I got a call -- Quietly, slow down, whoa --Shut it. Shut yer fuckin' mouth. You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands. Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show -- I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok. No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going -- In my sleep, Burt. And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us." It's been the same fuckin' thing for thirty years, Burt -- ooohhhhhh no. I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt. Your mother wants to hear from you -- Honey. Please put your clothes on, please -- baby, please, please -- I'm not lying to you, I'm not -- I'm dying, Claudia. I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I -- Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T -- I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick. I'm not saying that, I'm sorry -- Don't yell, honey. Please don't go crazy -- I don't want you to think that I'm that way to you -- I'm not gonna call you a slut or something -- Please. It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this -- ...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you -- I want to sit. I want to talk to you. No. No. I'd like to talk to you. Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door -- It's me. Claudia. It's me. Fuck no. I got in trouble at school. I won't. If she asks me any question I want to tell her. I want to tell her everything I've done. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think -- I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore. It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around. I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done -- No. ...you know... You look great. Fuck. I think I'm gonna throw up, I think. I haven't thrown up since I was twenty years old. I can't fuckin' do this. Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary. Fucking hell. Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building -- I need you to get me Paula -- Fifteen minutes ago, where were those cards? It's okay, Stanley. It's alright. I'm sorry, Stanley. What were you saying, Stanley? I'm gonna need a full name, Stanley. For 25. Best known for the "tragedy and blood" genre, this author-playwright -- I don't know what I've done. Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay? I don't know what I've done. ...I don't know... I don't know what I've done . I really don't know. I don't know. ...No.... She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something. She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head... I think that she thinks I may have molested her. Do you know the answer to this? Maybe...I don't... Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean? I love you so much. I don't know.... I don't. What? No, Rose, jesus, no -- It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said. It's over. I talked to her this morning. Two years...three years... Just once. No. That's it. Paula. Ellen. Rose, I don't -- Yes. I'll answer anything. I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times. Will that help? Yeah. --- don't. don't. Please. Just... listen to me...honey.... ...I've done...I've cheated on you. No, I mean: I'm telling you this, now. You see? You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up.... I'm a bad person. Do you love me, Rose? How do we do this, then? It's not really pain. I don't think I want that. Love you too.. I don't know. I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march -- She went crazy. She went crazy, Rose. I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table -- As fast as I can. I'm drinking. I'm sorry. I'II go....is it...back here? Can I come in? I'm her father. You're her boyfriend? Yes. What's your name? Are you her boyfriend? Hello. Is Claudia here?Let me call you a car, Linda. Linda -- You need to sober up. I'm trying to help, Linda -- Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time -- -- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen. The money would go to Frank. The court would put the money in the hands of a relative -- Well. Considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will -- You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time. Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down. What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's -- You can't change his will. Only Earl can change his will. Linda, you're safe. Ok. It's alright. You're my friend. You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say -- Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this -- Are you on drugs right now? You don't want any water?It's alright. Want me to wake her up? Yeah. She's sleeping now, I mean -- No, I'm just a friend. What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia? I'm Bob. You're Jimmy Gator, right? She's asleep. Hello?Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother -- Yeah, hey. Chad. It's a helluva disease. Oh that's good. It's rough. I'm sorry, did she make it? Brain and Lung. There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know. Dying of Cancer. Does this sound weird? I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore -- OK. See: Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son.... Well, ok. Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go: I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse. He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello? Are you there, hello? Well can you connect me to someone else? Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself? Hi, hello, great. This is Seduce and Destroy? What? Say it again...walking in the car? Twelve. Graduation? No. No. Frank Mackey. That's your son? It's ok. You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number -- Is Jack your son? Who? Who are you gonna call? I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill -- Go fuck myself? How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?" There's no asshole like you. I've seen it before. Yeah. -- memory? When was the last time you talked to your son? She loves you. She went out. She said she went out to run some errands. She'll be back. I'm trying. No. Where is he? You do? Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it? How's today then? Alright. Thank you. Is this 509-9027? I'm looking for Frank Mackey. Hi. Is Frank there? I don't think, he can't... yeah. ...ok... It's interesting. When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes .... I've heard your tapes on the phone. Yeah. I'm really sorry. I work as a nurse, for a proffesion -- About three weeks ago. Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very... I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine. He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand? He's...I'm sorry...so sorry...I've seen this before, you know and you don't.... He's going very fast....Frank...um.... For six months. I'm the day nurse... Ok. He's in here. These Dogs'll calm down -- you just have to come in -- She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry. This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in? Yes. I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing -- Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you. We got dissconnected. Hello. Frank. Frank TJ Mackey. ....it's alright.... Earl asked me, Linda, please, Linda, I'm sorry -- Earl asked me -- No, Linda, you don't understan -- I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son.

You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened? Why didn't you answer those questions? What's the problem, what's the problem here? Go to it, handsome. You ready to keep winning? You coulda been in front -- C'mon, man.

I'm wondering about the weather department. I'm wonderin' wether or not the weather people use outside meteorlogical services or if they have in-house instruments? Have you ever been there? Where's the news department at this studio? Where's Richard and Julia? I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry. We are not on display. I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART? I KNOW. I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO. I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you! Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere. Willa Cather. I don't wanna do it. Why can't one of you do it -- They look pretty smart, I think. What's MOW? Like what? No. I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always -- I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time. Shut up -- shut up -- I gotta go to the bathroom. Maybe. They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library. I don't have regular classes anymore. I think that you have to be nicer to me. You have to be nicer to me, Dad. Alright. Yes. I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing -- I said I'm fine. I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine. I don't know.

I need my books. I need them to go to school. I need this one. We need more dog food -- This happens....this is something that happens. It's raining frogs from the sky. It's frogs. It's raining frogs. I can take you to get money. I don't need it...I don't need it -- listen to me: I can let you have money so your father won't hit you ever again -- you'll have the money because I don't need it. I have money to give you. I have money. It's not right. ....Why does he do it...? Yes. It's ok. Hi. It's ok. Hi."It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..." Gently, son -- Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt -- You seem the sort of person who confuses the two. Stay that way. Why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold. Mmm.Hmm. "Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now. Shall we drink to that? This sounds Sad as a Weeping Willow. Things go round 'n round, don't they? Picky, picky. It was the lovely Samuel Johnson who also spoke of a fella "Who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others." Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself." Brad, dear? That's right. But you're alright now, so what's the what? Might of been before my time. Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel. You're a friend of the family I presume? And I'm listening avidly, fellow. A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems. Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me. Well -- I have love all over. I even have love for you, friend. This sounds threatening. Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.Yeah! He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing! He rubs you and sucks the disease right out! Ehhh, you know those guys. If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day. And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer. My hair is coming out. I can't move my arm. Then he'll borrow it. I know Tony better than you do. Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it! Tony Clifton. I don't care about the money. I just want the show to deliver. No clubs. I wanna reach the TOP! Carnegie Hall...! I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show. The best show anybody's ever seen! Y-yeah? Well, then it has to stop! Because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick I am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I'm dead. Of course! But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support! I can't be surrounded by negative energy. It's visualization therapy. He's helping me turn inward and fight the disease. I -- I got some freaky rare kind. It's called large-celled carcinoma. No, it's true. I have lung cancer. The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want... Hey! Our first phone call! Hello? Maybe I can turn it into a bit. I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged. Demand a recount... We were just trying to push the envelope -- What, you don't think I can beat him? That's because they've only seen it once. But I'll do it again, and again, and AGAIN... They'll catch on! They're having a laugh... That means it was a success. I woke up the audience -- like punk rock! Here, take this. George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do. 'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them. But wasn't it funny? Oh dear! George, this is gonna kill Tony. He's waited his whole life for this break. Oh no! Did he get hurt? Oh, you know the Bay Area! Always foggy! Hi, George! Good to hear from you! How long would they let me sleep? But George, I like to push the boundaries... I'm sorry, George... Okay... I'll go back. But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka. They're gettin' Tony! Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!" The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I could have my own Special! What's up? Of course. But only on Monday nights. Hi George! He's a Vegas entertainer. I used to do impressions of him. We sorta... got in a fight over that. Those are my terms. Okay. Fine, I'll do it. But I have a few terms. I refuse. I'm not interested. I want to create my own material. I told you, I'm not a comedian. And sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: Stupid jokes and canned laughter. No to the whole thing. None of it sounds good. No. George, I hate sitcoms. I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO! The Fonzie! The crazy breakout character! The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes! Sitcom...? The stewardess let me keep my headphones. I've always wanted to play Carnegie Hall. I'm not a comedian. I have no talent. I'm a song-and-dance man. It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea. It sunk. GEORGE Oh. Hm. I'm uh, sorry. Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting. If you ever need representation... we should talk. No. Caspiar. Tank you veddy much. I don't swear. I -- I don't do what everyone else does! What do you want? "Take my wife, please"?? You're firing me?? You don't even pay me! So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...? But that's it. I needed you to believe! Our family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they'll be touched. Because your emotions were honest! Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in. Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in. B-but I have them. But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five. Oh! Maybe I should talk to the natives. Shoom boom boo ba! Shoom boom boo ba -- These kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials. Now for sure they're gonna fire me, so if you want to see me again, you'll have to come to Memphis... Right... Deal. Twenty! But it's only for thirty seconds! But it's funny! It's a practical joke. They'll get frustrated! I've never understood that. It's just... getting dark. But I like you! Hey! Why don't we fill the car with gas, drive to Tijuana, and GET MARRIED??? What do you mean? No no no, it's not sex! I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling. Do you wanna wrestle? It's a good way of breaking the ice. That instant physical intimacy really brings two people together. Okay. You're probably right. Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. No, NO! Not yet. I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times. They don't know... they've gotta run more tests. You don't know the real me. I don't deserve Haagen Daz. I'm a horrible person. Oh, it's open. Go away. I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in the action...! I can shtop whenever I want... Ooo, the little lady's upset. Well I say -- get back in the kitchen! If you want... Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world! I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me! Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win! Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show! What do you say??? Yes. Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married? Oh! Uh, I hope I didn't offend you. Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. Popcorn? No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Hi... Gosh. Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond." I really want one. One large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter. Popcorn? No, I'm sure we'll be fine. Hi... Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously. It was just part of the show! It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd. Gosh, you scored! Look at all those goodies! DON'T TOUCH ME! I said I didn't want to do the sketch. But I don't do drugs! And I don't enjoy making light of them! I was promised creative control! You're not listening to me -- I'm not comfortable with the last sketch. I DON'T do drug humor! And you're just poor white trash! My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- And you're just poor white trash! My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --! T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me -- No! NO NO NO! None of that! I want this show to be positive! Well, call SAG. It'd be cool to get one on the show. I want the evening to build and build. It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down! This is great. The crowd's gonna love this! Hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive? I was very original! Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers -- I, I was asked to do this material - - Sir, do you have a problem? It's a rave! Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me. You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler... Look at this! An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty! Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy! Boy, they totally fell for it! I'm only acting crazy! It's so dirty. I dunno about this... What will my mother think? They're asking for it. Give me the book. So? What do they know? Each show is worse than the next. I'm gonna quit. Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda. Bob and I have been buddies for years. So HELP ME! All I wanna do is MEDITATE!! Please! You've GOT to let me take the classes! It's how I keep myself BALANCED!! "Philosophically"? Why?? I... I attend every year. Yes, your Holiness? I stopped drinking. I gave up drugs. And I'm meditating three hours a day. It's the center of my life... Um, yes. I haven't fought with them, since I started here. Doctor, I think I need a neck brace. But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough... Are you sure?Really? Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work? Yeah... You've got good days and bad days. You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money. So who's gonna pay for it? Do you wanna tour the clubs? So how can I help you...? Andy, you're surrounded by what you create. You are the KING of negative energy. You must take a little pleasure in it. What was that all about? That's ridiculous. You don't even smoke. Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you. Andy... it's me. I've got some crummy news. Taxi's been canceled. Andy! You don't get it! They don't want you back. You're BLIND! There is no envelope anymore!! It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution -- I don't want you two to ever work together again. He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion. He'll kill you. First, you piss-off women. Then you piss-off the South. Then you get killed! And I did the bookings. Andy, do you realize you don't do comedy anymore? Where's that sweet guy who used to do "Here I come to save the day!"? Please, enough with the wrestling! You've lost touch with reality! WRONG! You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody! No, I'm not gonna take it. If I take it I'll break my back. But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. It's obsessive. Nothing's ever on the level anymore. "Funny"? I dunno. But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure. Like, that moment, when you both came onstage... You're so proud. You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!" There'll be other shots. I'm here with Ed over at Taxi. There's been some trouble with Tony. Hi, Andy. How's the weather up there? I don't know! Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain? The audience... or yourself? And that's great. But do it in LA and New York! There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage! I don't care! When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude. If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse! You give 'em Elvis!! You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry! And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him! You signed for five years -- So four years, seven months. Tell you what. I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it -- Look, I'm sorry. They're assholes! But we work in a creative business. You can't predict what people are gonna like -- Andy! That's alright. Where...? Eh, hi, Andy. Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere? Andy? They're IMPOSSIBLE!! Jesus! I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??! Who is this TONY CLIFTON?! Are you makin' fun of me --? This is RIDICULOUS! Of course! That's what negotiations are for. LISTEN, you arrogant putz! I've been in this business for twenty years! I know! If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!! You have to do it. B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha-- Andy... this is every comedian's dream. "No"? "No" to which part?? HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part! ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into -- "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!! And this is a CLASS ACT! It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows! It takes place in a taxi stand! And you're gonna be the Fonzie! That's... terrific! But I got something better. This is BIG... You are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!! Andy, c'mon IN! Thanks for flyin' out here!! You show a lot of promise... but... my concern is I don't know where to book you. You're not a stand-up... your act doesn't exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself? People love... comedians. Caspiar? I haven't heard of that. So I understand you're from Lithuania? Hey, I really enjoyed your set. Yeah, I KNOW what I said! But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen! Gene, you misunderstood!! You're not getting BOTH of them! It's physically impossible! No, I'm serious. If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY. Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman. Really?! You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe?? Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like playing casinos. The audiences don't work well for him. Look... I don't know what your problem is... Who is this? TONY CLIFTON You -- you know damn straight who it is. Tony Clifton! A name to respect. A name to fear. Beer. Gear. Deer. Ear. Can I help you with something? Er, yes. Speaking. It's a perfect Kaufman audience. If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you. FORGET IT. It's in terrible taste! I want nothing to do with this. Why...? Andy, why...? Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback. God, listen to this! "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..." But what's the POINT? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world? So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe. You... and you. Bob, Andy needs to RELAX. See if you can get him away from all this. Take him to Hawaii, or Bali... Find something special. Something nice... I'm worried about Andy. His stress level is affecting his work. So your name's not Gorsky.And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?" And he says, "Cancer!" I dunno. If they were, they'd be pushin' 80. Yeah, exactly -- "was"! But now, you're creatively bankrupt. In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!! I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine. Isn't that true??? Who gives a shit?! It's not funny! Sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap. Kaufman, people are sick of you. The wrestling... the hoaxes... Yeah, my problem is you're tired. It's working for Elvis. "... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis. His parents are at his bedside. Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television's Taxi"... No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it. These he- men'll kick your ass!! They're huge! What is this, World War Two...? "Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?" Nah. The girls sponge off between johns. She'll say, "Now my son is a man." No! Andy, don't do it -- Absolutely nothing! That's the beauty! It's credibility. You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads! Are you nuts?! 40 million people watch you every week! What?!? Hey Andy, good show. Yeah. They don't know whether to be sad, or angry. What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?! I was the one saying I didn't believe it! Hey, that's good! We can make that play. And we'll really drag it out. You get better, you get worse... you die... I used to think you were original. Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity! Sure! But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony. I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head! Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon? Maybe that'll chill him out. Don't believe everything you hear. That was a really hot house!No! Don't hate me, Trinity. I'm just the messenger. And right now I'm going to prove it to you. That's what you think. They've promised to back me, Trinity. They're going to reinsert my body. I'll go back to sleep and when I wake up, I'll be fat and rich and I won't remember a goddamn thing. It's the American dream. Oh, I disagree, Trinity. I disagree. I think the Matrix is more real than this world. I mean, all I do is pull a plug here. But there, you watch a man die. Yes. You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future. But it's not here. It's in the Matrix. I'm tired, Trinity. I'm tired of this war, I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day. But most of all, I'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit. You are a beautiful woman. Too bad things had to work out like this. He had an accident. Hello, Trinity. I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know. There's something about him, isn't there? Yeah, 'course I'm sure. Hear what? I intend to, believe me. Someone has to. You don't, do you? Do you? We're going to kill him. Do you understand that? He's going to die just like the others. You weren't supposed to relieve me. Any time. Honestly. Morpheus. He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off. Dead. All dead. Five. Since I've been here. You bet your ass. It keeps him going. Maybe it keeps all of us going. I'm going to let you in on a little secret here. Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One. Gee-zus! What a mindfuck. You're here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that? Why you're here? Have to. The image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead. You want a drink? The Matrix? Yeah. Midnight watch. No, it's all right. Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me. He's going to pop! Just get me outta here. There was an accident. A fucking car accident. All of a sudden. Boom. Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me. I need an exit! Fast!You all look the same to me. And you are? Hurry! I know, Trinity. Don't worry. He's going to make it. Five minutes. Maybe six. He's beginning to believe. We have no choice. Give me your phone. We found him, Trinity. We finally found him. Shit! Apoc? Go. You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Lake. You can make it. Yes. I know. They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit. She told you exactly what you needed to hear. That's all. Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path. Trinity! Go! Get to the basement. Find the catch basin! I know. That is why it is so important for you to go. Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me. Listen to me, Neo. I know why you're afraid to go through that door. You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong. You must believe me. There is a greatness inside of you, Neo. A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world. No. I did not. I have never told anyone this, Neo. After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me. I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me. Yes I do. Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots. These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut. That's why we're here. What do you believe in? Why? That I would find the One. Yes. Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong. She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path. She is a true psychic. She sees beyond the relativity of time. For her there is no past, present or future. There is only what is. She would say she knows enough. Of the Resistance. Yes. She's very old. She's been with us since the beginning. Set down in there. No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to. I've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air. Yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world. Because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be. Every attempt to fight them has ended in failure. Only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. Unkillable. But now I believe that is going to change. Look again. No you don't. Did you see the woman in the red dress? Do you understand, Neo? This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson. The body cannot live without the mind. Your mind makes it real. Do you know why you didn't make it? I'm trying to free your mind, Neo, but all I can do is show you the door. You're the one that has to step through. Tank, load the jump program. Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place? How did I beat you? Show me. Your training. Get some rest. You're going to need it. I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it would be the truth. Yes. A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age. I say almost funny. We have only bits and pieces of information. What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration. Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I. What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain. Wild, isn't it? You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know. More important than what is when? You've never used them before. Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them. Far from it. Be what? Be real? Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location. That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind. The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. Do you want to know what it is? Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something. What you know you can't explain but you feel it. You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad. It is this feeling that brought you to me. Do you know what I'm talking about? I know exactly what you mean. Why not? Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo? Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here? I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up. I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole? Please. Come. Sit. Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus. Go the the Adams Street bridge. Do you still want to meet? You're the One, Neo. You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you. They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead. This line is tapped so I must be brief. There are only two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you. There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it. Good. Now there is a window. Open it. Go! Now! The cubicle across from you is empty. I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say. I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there. Yes. Yes. Now. Stand up and see for yourself. I've been looking for you, Neo. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do. Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is? He is the One. He is the One! Do it! Tank, charge the E.M.P. We're on our way -- We need an exit. Tank. Good. I need the main wet-wall. How is he?You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming? I don't know... My computer... Right... If you get caught using that -- You got the money? You're two hours late. Who is it? Thanks... for the drink. How? What happened to them? How many were there? Really? ... Yeah. Do you always look at it encoded? Is that...? What are you doing? Sorry. I don't believe it! I don't believe it! Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me -- No. No! Morpheus! Don't! Morpheus, I don't know -- Did you believe in them too? Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What about them? And you still believe I'm the One? Why? So I can hear some old lady tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world? Come on. How do I respond to that? I can't. It's ridiculous. I mean who am I? I'm nobody, I'm just a guy. What did I do, Morpheus? Why me? What do I believe it? Are you kidding me? What do you think? I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't. The whole world, my entire life was a lie. I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus. I told you I don't believe in this stuff. No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point? Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea. What did she tell you? She helped you? And she's never wrong. How does she know? And she knows what? Everything? The beginning? So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy? What's going on? What? Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets? How? Yeah. I think I do. What -- what lesson? If you are killed in the Matrix, you die here? I thought it wasn't real. Because... I didn't think I would? I know what you're trying to do -- You -- you're too fast. This is incredible. I know kung fu. For what? No! I don't believe it! It's not possible! A.I.? You mean artificial intelligence? This isn't real? Right now, we're inside a computer program? When? Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place? Why do my eyes hurt? What are you doing? ... am I dead? This can't be... What does that mean? What truth? The Matrix? Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life. No. You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you. You could say that. It's an honor. ... Yes. What do you know? The agents -- No way, no way, this is crazy. No! It's too far away. How do you know all this? But what if...? How?! What the fuck do they want with me?! Holy fucking shit! Right now? Who's coming for me? Morpheus... Hello? What? What do you mean, without him? Morpheus. He almost had me convinced. What? I'm not the One. But what? Honestly? I don't know. Who? How did you know...? Shit, I'm sorry. What vase? Yeah. You're the Oracle? Hello? Can you fly that thing. I'm fine. Come on, we have to keep moving. It wasn't fast enough. Do what? Yeah? No, you're not. What are you doing? I believe I can bring him back. Why? I'm sorry, I'm not. I'm just another guy. Morpheus is the one that matters. I'm not the One, Trinity. The Oracle hit me with that too. Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not. I have to. I'm going in after him. That I would have to make a choice... There has to be something that we can do. I don't know. It just went dead. Is Morpheus alive? We can't leave him! What is it? It might have been. I'm not sure. A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it. Nothing. Just had a little deja vu. ... right as rain. What did she tell you? Did you go to her? Should I be? Is it? But an Oracle can. What does that mean? I used to eat there... Really good noodles. God... E.M.P. An electromagnetic pulse. Get this thing out of me! Uh-oh... What is this thing? ... shit. Why? From what? What the hell is this?! What is the Matrix? Who is? Of what? How did you do that? Do you want to go somewhere and talk? I just thought... you were a guy. Gee-zus. Trinity? The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base? Who are you? How do you know that name? It's locked. Which way? Which way? Mr. Wizard, get me the fuck out of here! Guns. Lots of guns. Because I believe in something. I know that's what it looks like, but it's not. I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed. I understand that now. That's why I have to go. The Oracle. She told me this would happen. She told me... Does it? I don't know. This can't be just coincidence. It can't be! Can it? Goddamnit! I don't believe this is happening! What do they want? How much time? How? What are they doing to him? See who? Hell yes! Holy shit! Where is it? It's a city? Zion? You don't have... No.Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store. I got you. Cypher? Operator. How...?! I'm going to make the call. Yes, sir. Got one ready, sir. Subway. State and Balbo. Goddamn! It's good to hear your voice, sir! Now left and that's it in front of you. Got it. Ten hours straight. He's a machine. Kick it in! Kick it in! Duck! Operator. Okay. Store's open. What do you need? Besides a miracle... Why? Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building. Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him. Three of them! I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide. What are you talking about? Neo, this has to be done! Every leader of every ship is given the codes to Zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the Matrix. They are used only in emergencies. If an agent had those codes and got inside Zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system. It would be the end of everything. When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know. Depends on the mind. But eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this. They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems. It's like cracking a computer. All it takes is time. They're hacking his mind. The Oracle. Hey, Mikey, he likes it! Ready for more? Deep underground. Near the earth's core, where it's still warm. You live long enough, you might even see it. The last human city. The only place we got left. If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be. Any holes? Nope. Me and my brother Dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human. Born free. Right here in the real world. Genuine child of Zion. You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator. Morning. Did you sleep? They've burned through the outer shields. I don't know. I lost him. I can't! What the hell just happened? Operator. Trinity, we don't have any other choice. There is. We have to pull the plug. I'll be all right. So did we. I sent him to Franklin and Erie. You're not far from Cypher. Yes. They're moving him. I don't know where yet. Operator.No Roger from op/ed? Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night. Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand. Leave. YOU DID. Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating. I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter. Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us. Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it. And that's the best part. "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it! It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system-- That's your story! I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece. No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story. OUT! Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it. Do you even know these kids? This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo! Have you been to any parties? Have you been there? Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night." No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune. Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing! And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?! You're a sick puppy, Geller. Geller, this is way out of your league. Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out. Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls. A flack jacket. You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters? Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter. Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it. Eh. How many times have I fired her? So. You and Roger in Op/Ed. Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.Josie, you rock my world. You're like the most amazing girl I've ever dated. You're so smart and fun and crazy! You rock my world. My sword. Hey--what are you thinking about? You having fun? Cool. I'll catch you later. Rufus. But I don't even know where you live. I'm sure you've probably heard that I want to ask you, but I'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. I know we Didn't hit it off right at the beginning but- I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there. Hey there. Yeah, you gonna be there? Dude, you rock! Are you in special ed?No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up. No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys? No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age. Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay. I know. Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business". Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus. Wow, Josie- you look really- And a gymnast! With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one. This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time! No. Josie, this is real. That's the spirit! Plus, if you quit you're no better than me. Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story? Little known fact. Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it. Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore. Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team. Why is that impossible? These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here! No, I mean, no big whoop. No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn. I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous. Don't you remember what they called you? Do you remember high school? Wow. This must be big. You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life! Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you! Someday this luau is going to be all mine! I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life. See! No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list. She just needs a new windshield wiper. No it's not. Guys name their penises. Relax, Monty. It's just my sister. I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time. I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches. Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today? Wow - I- Maybe we should sit. Yeah. Definitely. Well, a ball player. Thank you. I'm Rob.What about the "Roaring Twenties"� or "The 80's"? Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea. I thought this was a 45-minute seminar. You're Pam? Hi. You're here for the sex talk? I told you you could write, Josie Geller. I just can't look at you the same way. The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker. Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist! You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you. Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical. What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you? "Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?! So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth? No, I'm alone. Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on. Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen. Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story. told him --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate! No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you. Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth! Yeah, actually I do. Our penguin, right? Yeah. To watch the world go by.-- That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody. Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common. You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude. I'm thinking when I'm home. Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought. I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher. I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you. I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages. Boys. You have to say that. You're my student. God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all. Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class? Yoooooow. You remember that story? Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me. I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights. This seat taken? Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--" Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural. That's crazy. I'll get you some applications. So what are you thinking for college? Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker. Hey, Josie, hold on. You've been hiding something from me. Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's. True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. Are you sure you're seventeen? Not the happiest of souls. "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop." You like her? Whoa. Deja Vu. Hi, everyone. I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it. I did. Well, fire away. Pleased to meet you. Did you like the film?No! Now you're lying. I'm delighted. I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie? Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner. And this is William. Christ, what is going on in there? Does the girl have a name? He's bringing a girl? Where's Bella? If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here. Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers. Bernie -- this is Anna. Hello, Bernie. Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian. So not over her, in fact. Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath. Don't give a damn about the famous girl. So -- you've laid the ghost. There's an understatement. There are dead people on better form. Any more announcements? Is it someone we know? That's not fair. Well? Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems. Let's face facts. This was always a no-go situation. Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods. You didn't know she had a boyfriend? I think you do, yes. You see -- it means 'yes.' Do you ever masturbate? 'No comment' means 'yes.' You haven't slept with her, have you? Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.No, sir. No, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I have him in my mind. I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir. May I help you, sir?What happened? You daft prick! I was called and I came. What's up? Well, yes. Groovy. Me? Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives. No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this. What's going on? I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub. What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan. I went out in my goddamn underwear too. Why not? Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay. No -- you're right. Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go? Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one? And you get on very well. And she's in your house. I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it? Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word. I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect. Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend. You're welcome. Did you find them? That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer? No, 'fraid not. I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.' Try 'Flintstone.' Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough... Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name. Absolutely not. Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again. You want me to write down all your messages? Yeh, I wrote a couple down. Groovy. You should do more of this stuff. There's something wrong with the goggles though... Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey. Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes... Hey. Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her. Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic. There's something wrong with this yogurt. Thanks. Great. Wish me luck. Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more. Cool, huh? Point taken. Well... wait for it... First there's this one... That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt. Even he. Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted. And what would you say... I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. ... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically. The truth is... ... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that? Sorry about that. But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones. You were saying... What's the thing? Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway. Thank you. Shall I... Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory ... Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you. Hello. Okay. Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy. I only found out you were here yesterday. Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow. I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins. That's not true. And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. Can't we just laugh about this? Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter. Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea. That's spectacularly unfair. I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm... You do? That's not true. I don't know what happened. How are you doing? Undressed like this, yes. Don't ask. Stay forever. You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been. Who was Gilda? Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look... More than that actually, when you think about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair... Well... Oh God yes -- I'm sorry. It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked. Wow. No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not. Oh please sod off. Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed. The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom? It's one hell of a job. What do you put on your passport? Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom. Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own? You have a stunt bottom? You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity? No. What's that? Yes. Always have had. With a goat playing a violin. You like Chagall? And I think the book is the poorer for it. I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too. Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping. Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say. Yup. 'Certainly. And little Johnny?' Cartwright. Eleven. 'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.' 'Message from command. Would you like them to send in the HKs?' Well done you. Hand it over. Basic plot? Would you like me to take you through your lines? I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing? Oh no no -- no. Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer. No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he? Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...? This is the place. Come in. I think goodbye is traditional. -- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize... Your boyfriend? Why? To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing. There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't. I don't know, I'm afraid. No, you were brilliant I'm sorry. She saw through me. She left me. It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing. I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long. Exactly. Here we go again. I don't think so. No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're... No, I didn't. Nothing. Whoopsidaisies. Ahm... Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in. Gardens. All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages. I thought you were leaving. That's fine. You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it. It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago. It's the hair! It's to do with the hair. You'll have to prove it. This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it. State your claim. Okay. I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something. You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party? But no, I'm sure I can get out of it. Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner. Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied. Are you busy tonight? I'm just a complete moron. Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life. Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you. Absolutely fine about it. I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. Obviously. Very difficult. Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it? Sorry about not ringing back. The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect. I brought these, but clearly... Hi. Right. Great. Classic. Classic. Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something? No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message. Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop. Hello. Hi. Hi. Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it. I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. Disaster... Here we go. Oh right. Oh hi. Forget something? Yes. Well. My pleasure. You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. Do you always say 'no' to everything? Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them. Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest? Orange juice -- probably not. Coffee? Would you like a cup of tea before you go? Eighteen yards. That's my house there. I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously. Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up. Here, let me help. Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune. Sorry about that... I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab. Yes. This one though is... very good. That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. You'd be wasting your money. Fine. Yes, I think that one may be. Tony -- what do you think? Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman. Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch. In a depressingly asexual way. Bella -- this is Anna. He's cooking guinea fowl? Is Miss Scott staying here? It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. What? Yes -- sort of... Bernie. Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director? Da Vinci? Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22? Is this your first film? What do you think? Good move? Well, thanks, that's great. Blimey. What's that? Hun -- this is Anna. Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter. Ahm... Bernie. Ah -- no. It's fine. Right. No, I'm sure it'll be fine. Absolutely. Ice cold still water. I'll see what I can do. Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call. Ahm... room service. This is Henry James film? Yes? The others? 'Horse and Hound.' The name's William Whacker. I think she might be expecting me. I agree. Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit? Any bit in particular? Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film? Ah... yes, enormously. Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin? Can you tell her I'll ring her back. Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you? Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself? Martin -- your customer. Right -- want another one? Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it? So it could have been neither of them? But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol. Topol. Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here. Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford. Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347. Great. Excellent. Thanks. Oh God no. No, don't think I do. I believe I have. But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy. Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth. Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend. I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters. She's perfect, perfect. Really? Buggered? Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine. No -- did you? So I get the brownie? Definitely no comment. No, it doesn't. That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment. Max. This is Anna. Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks. Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead? How about Miss Flintstone? And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember... No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake. Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you... Hello. Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically... No, no. She doesn't. Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott... Right -- let's talk about rent... I'm going to throw out these old videos. Right. Was it you? Well, there are. And we don't need to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective. Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry. Just take my work for it. I wouldn't go outside. I'll talk to you in the morning. Spike! Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip. Yes. Yes. Maybe. Spike. Oh my God... Hello. I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I? She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box. And there's trouble inside. Well, okay. There's this girl... Sort of. Thanks for your help on the glasses thing. Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go. Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties. Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses? Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you? What? Which was? What did she say? Right. No one else? Who were the ones you didn't write down from? Two? That's it? So -- any messages? No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly. There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes. Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that? Hi... Yes, she is fairly fabulous. It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise. Good luck. Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done. Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind. Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note. What are the choices? This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt? Fabulous. Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away. No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby. Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. Oh. Right. Are you sure you...? Which floor? Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec. Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and, what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize. The one down your trousers. So, I saw you put that book down your trousers. We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop. Bad news. Excuse me.Look, he's in pretty good shape. Or a vegetarian? Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living. I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong? I have no idea what I'm doing. Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best. Of course we are. Of course. Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy? Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?... Then come for dinner. You're coming here? No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run? Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention. Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance... Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints. Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot. If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate. It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again. All the gory details. Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct. Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now... In vino veritas. Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.Got any last minute advice? Really? Thank you. How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"? At this pace, it could be an evening wedding. You bet ya, Coach. Ahh. Maggie! Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie. Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you? But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be. See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time? Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you. I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up. I didn't cook up a story. I had a source. Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse. What? So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway? Fully. I like her. She has wit. Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?! Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do. Then you'll be my best man. No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that... Okay, we'll order out. Yeah. Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it. I don't know. This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet? Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car. But I'll get my normal fee, right? "Paid vindication" That's what I call justice. Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment. This is good. It is a good story, Fish. The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland. The real story on Miss Carpenter. What are you trying to say to me, Fish? Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving. Since when does Ellie need moral supp-- Oh, please! No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller. I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track. I don't think that's why she ran. Neuter a locust, feed the world. Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business? Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony. Thanks. You could have told me you were fiance number three. Get this man a Kamikaze. No, I'm not. Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you. Good fact. Well, you let me know. I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time? Yes, Mrs. Pressman. Sorry, no. I just got one. It's nice that they're still friends. That must have made you proud. Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer. I think you'd look good in red. Looking for Maggie. I am just such a reporter. And you are? About her upcoming wedding and all. What? Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street... Thank you. Bye, Betty. Thanks. Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing -- Yes, I am. And who are you? Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday... Ah, beautiful. I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that. You know, your daughter seems... Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...? They made me put my hat back on. Pretty good speech, Maggie. I'm listening. You were not. This is getting serious. Used? Yes, I did. Does it matter? You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here? Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific. I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor! So am I. And the wedding date. There's the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back. Well, you do have the dress. Me? I love you. I love you. I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it. A little longer for me. I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back. I'd rather not. No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right? No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma. With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much. That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs. Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on. Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress. And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai? What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo? Or the sexual habits of locusts? Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again. No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party. I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you. I don't and I don't think you should... Are you all right with this? You think this is funny? I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this? Missed me bad, huh? No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting. Kind of isolated. Of what? Can you fix it? Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him. Keep an eye on him. Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you? It's valuable. Hang onto it. Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this? Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss. Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet? Of course. Bob will be very happy. You look... uh... You look fine. Agreed. No. I don't know. No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?" I'm a work in progress. Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. Highly suspect. It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run. Always a mood killer. Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room. You afraid to try? I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York. Cindy the manicurist. Done. Five hundred. Too much. You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one? My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical. Really. I'm not a boastful man. What's your point? I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers. Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me. You can turn that finger around. Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken. But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back. A pre-wedding luau? Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak. How romantic. Really? Everest. Is that right? That's fair. We'll see. Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do. I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart... Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them? Getting nervous? You'll answer my questions? Originality is my speciality.What? What of it? ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. It has been a terrible jolt to her nerves. You need rest. You need to sleep. He is dead. You would be also, if your wound had not somehow shut. Keep still, Constable. You were half-drowned when they found you. I do not care. You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place. A diseased monster. The Lenape. He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time. We must be a curious sight to him. What is that? To place it inside its coffin. I was afraid of this. Excuse me?You cannot do this. I am a man of God! Damn you, sir! God damn you to hell! They need guidance. I am the Lord's voice in this town. Are you a deist? Is that it? A free thinker who does not believe in divinity. No. You will not run me out. No one will believe a word of what you say. For poaching. Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost? Your superiors are two days away! I will not allow it. I will not! It is sacrilege! The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all. Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm? How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?How did you hear this? Um... I... I did not... no. Why? Well enough. Your gathering does honor to the deceased. These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there. Who took the meat? Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes. Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman? If we could speak alone. I hit him square. I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing. Two days... ? For murder? You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large? Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine. Excuse me, Miss... They have a laugh at your expense. When this cut was made, this person was already dead. This is not Lady Van Tassel. No clotting or gathering of pus. No healing at all. Stains of blood. Would you stay, doctor? I may need assistance. You will stay at her side? Bring him. Bring Young Masbath here. ... Brom Bones... In time, doctor. Soon as I finish. The wounds are the same. Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head. Have you seen, doctor... ? Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter. He is a behemoth. What are you spying on? This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow.... No bleeding. Why did you move the body, Doctor? I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts? An honor, gentlemen. In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be? Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father. That is the closest you ever come to God. You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night. He may. But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf. Wallowing quite literally in blood. Wallowing in sin and lust... It is only important what you are. An adulterer... Oh? Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here. Only if I repeat them outside this room. And, I will if I must... Out there, for all to hear. Or... you may speak, as planned. But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures. Does that look like an animal hanging? Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today. Protest to my superiors if you like. I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims. All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies... Perhaps, I could assist in finding them? Master Hardenbrook... Maybe you should take this. May we look at them now? May I see them, Master Hardenbrook? Yes, sir... but, do you have these? Do you have these persons' wills? Just a moment... Are you saying it is he? Pardon me? I shall, gladly. Not for lack of trying. Chosen me? Not Liberalism. Equanimity. Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally? But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets? Without disrespect, look around you. We overflow. As do our courts. Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement. I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson. There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs... Just a moment... if I may. It is possible this man was murdered. Is that all you say? Look at her. Tell me something. What becomes of Young Masbath? More than enough, actually. I beg you, no more, please. At times I do. Listen to what you say.... I know it. Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck? Well... so much for common sense. What is that you wear? Believe? Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover? The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants. And the Widow Windsor was next... The militia? How are you? I doubt that's the end. Take the reins. I know. Hold on. Climb up! I cannot. You should not worry. Van Ripper and his wife will look after you. They will. You will be well cared for. This is farewell. You do not know all that has happened. You cannot understand. Nothing. To hell with this place and all the people here. I need time for thinking. Without you hanging on my coattails for a change. Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill. Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church. Find her at all costs. Quickly. Fiction plays and novels. Baltus does not approve. Now, come. It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns. It is nothing. She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. It is absolutely nothing. Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it. Did you find the victims' loan agreements? Lady Van Tassel. There are none for Magistrate Philipse either. "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William." Did your father take a loan? Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts? Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one. No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate. Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment. And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus. I heard him say it. To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place. Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted. What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? Business, best hidden is hidden best at night. Man or woman? Why this tree? Must be some sort of gateway. But, why this place... ? Stay back. Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply. True enough. You grow sharper by the minute, little man. It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others. "Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it? I admit not being anxious to find out. "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives. We are far from the Hollow. Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning. We should not go much further in this murk. How could something named "the tree of the dead" fail to draw attention? We are leaving. I hear nothing. What is it? Witches do not exist. However... If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves. Now, hold the bowl steady. Back to business. I have others. All I need is this. Yes... I suppose it is. Keep it. Not for eating, I assure you. Watch here. Are you familiar with magnets? Look again. Out there. What do you see? What is it? Up. His teeth. Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth. The Lenape could not have done that for himself. Someone out there cared for him. The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth. We must discover it. The reason the murderer chose these persons. What is the common thread between these victims? Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss. It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now. I manage fine alone. I am not here for revenge. I am here to bring justice. We have no choice. The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me. No. Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump. Keep climbing. I will follow... His horse. He moves too fast. I do not know. Away. Katrina... The name Van Tassel is blackened. You share that name. What would you have me believe? The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms. They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now. What did he say, Katrina? And, what did he say? It was you there? Come with me. What... what are you doing... ? Yes. I did notice that, thank you. Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside? He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass. Just... keep where you are. Blood. A woman should not be out alone in these woods. Katrina. Why do you follow? I... I do not know. I no longer know what I think or what I feel. Memories have come back. I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now. Lord, how I hate this place. What happened to your mother? Is she still alive? She is not your birth mother, is she? Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she? She bears so little resemblance. No, actually, you were not. Every word you spoke had truth in it. Allow me some time. I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone. If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it. Not for a moment. So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours. And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber. To avenge his father, and the others. I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. It was not butchery. There was no blind stabbing. This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword. I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. No stone may be left unturned. It may appear harsh... They have done nothing of the sort. If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I? Very well. But, it will only sit gathering dust. Thank you. No. Here... If you want. But... Yes, but listen. The illusion is easily explained. The eye retains each image, till they combine. And yet, some would call this toy magic. He only appears to be inside the cage. The point being... Here it is. A bird on one side. His cage on the other. Now, stare at it. The bird seems to be in his cage. I have had them since childhood. I cannot remember what from. I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment. May I ask... why do you cover your book that way? Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions. There is no such thing as magic. Are you so superstitious? Extra ordinary, yes. But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman. Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once. The massive fellow... Brom. For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat. Small talk. Excuse me... I should apologize. I, um... I... have no great love of... Feel free to form your own opinion. Though it appears you already have. Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel. Let her go! What... ? It is fine. Now, I must... It appears well. It has already clotted. Very little. I must be going... Where? Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room. Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here. Yes, actually. It is a prime tenet of science, Philipse, that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical. Van Ripper... do you have a gun? Turn around. Now! Van Ripper, turn the coach about! There was not much blood, was there? To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall? Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay? What... what are you doing? Can you help? The Horseman. Yes. The Lenape who lived in these woods... do you know him? The Redman? I should tell you... he has been murdered. In a way, yes. Pardon. You did not answer when I knocked. Are we intruding?She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession. Do you know what confession is? All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul. She has confessed. She is guilty. You do not want to be here. Go home to your father. Go home.Tired. What now? What can we do? Lady Van Tassel... Take me with you. There's nothing left for me here. Why... why are you like this? Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you? She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir? Sir? What now? Where is she? But, sir... what books? Where are they? What books? There are no other doors. This is as far as she could have gone. No. They are all missing. What was she doing? I was getting worried. Who was it? There is no Masbath here. My father's loan papers are missing. Yes. I rode with him on payment days. Baltus Van Tassel. What does it mean? In test... what? But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away? Yes. My father had farm land. It was the only thing we owned of any value. What good is this? If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? All I saw was their lantern. Someone left last night. Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest. We should go. What is it? Then, who murdered the Old Crone? And why? Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian. Someone only tried to make it look that way. What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place? Should we go back? Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies. To the tree of the dead. Maybe we passed it by. What happened? No crickets or cicadas calling. No bird songs. Listen. Father said witches live there. Thank you. No, I couldn't... It's spectacular. What kind of nuts? The Western Woods. It's payment day. Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month. Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers. Where are we going? How could he? I'm sure I don't know. I did not ask you to, did I? I deserve to help you. Don't you see how much this means? My father... he... he was a good man... Whatever. You still need a second to tend to your things.Did he see some danger from defen... When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this? What do you mean by 'dirty looks'? And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps. Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity. Why? If they could never take title. But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land. So...? So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then. I said. No further questions. Question withdrawn, you may step down. Doesn't it seem to you , Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation. Well, it seems to me... So you hid the truth. Deliberately. But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about? Why not? Up in the air? Was that your reaction? And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed. You thought the deceased might... break his promise? So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'. Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock? So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes? You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news? And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle? Well, what then, sergeant? So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager? And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat. And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference? So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up? And the last...? And the next one...? So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two. And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound. Could you tell me what 'kendo' is? And why. Is that? Did you say more? ...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head. Tht was summation, Your H... You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f... All right. What did your son say to that effect? Objection, asking the witness to speculate. Were you, sir? Can you prove one word of all your fancy story? And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful. At a tactic that insults their intelligence. I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h... Greedy. Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth. But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces. And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts? Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood. The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern. The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair. That's eleven things... Everything had to happen just right. For your little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons. Objection! Speculation. But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at it. And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy? Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you? Robbed. He was angry. Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible? Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth. I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest. You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir. My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth? Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth . Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance! But even after you had an attorney. You still claimed to know nothing . Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct? Actually, she said you had decided. Decided not not come forward.I did. But the jury won't s... Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again. There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you. The Japs did it. I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her. We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t... It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n... It'll be over soon. I can get you money. There can't be any wrong in this, Ha... Well, I don't do it for just anybody. Why? We're only talking. Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete. The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of. I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily. At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret. ...but he found you. Those aren't the facts that matter. Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid. I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found. Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know. No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt. That's curious. I was appealing to their intelligence. That's how journalists. Answer questions. He didn't want to lose any more. Like you couldn't believe. Oh, yes. Then putting them together. So truth is revealed. My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist. Twelve. I'm sorry, was there a question in there? Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side. Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows. You mean, early morning the 16th? How long you have this detail? And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em. You have the night watch? On the radio. It's on the twine, too. But it's not r... You're right. I better use two. Have a look. At nothing. It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it. Won't take two. Three kids. What's she going to do? We don't let go, you s... You ever been strangled by a single hand? Cigarette? The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast. He hit his head. On the way in. The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47. Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife? Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around. Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe... He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down. Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern... That's when he fell. Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask... That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case. Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern. To my father. Everything counts. Yes, he was. You're wondering why I held it. It's the way it happened, I know it is.Pretty darn clear. You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat. Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect. From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's. ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest. These are fishermen, Alvin. They don't talk at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip. Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine. Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin. You gonna climb that with one arm? Here now, what are you fixin' to do? Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place. You said three minutes. I did. Boy. Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there. In a half hour you could be in Canada. You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes. Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya? See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new. You always run with the well open? We have a warrant. To search your boat. You said that. That was your testimony. What else could it be? One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck. The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again. She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking. Possible. But not darn likely. He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere. I don't think so. I believe so. Apparently. No. Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for. It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it. He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6. It is. A little. Yes. You have to wonder. Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd. Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog. Maybe. Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup....or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable? With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull... You don't. Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull... No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair? You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff. Where a fella's hand goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...? And the blood could not have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative. But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his. So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was human , yes? Type B positive. It is. So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500. Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre? Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500? Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather. Well, what if? All right, what if the defendant heard ? So Carl let him aboard, to help. And then the fishing gaff? Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help? Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f... So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense? I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place. Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff? Now, Mister Gi... Your Honor, all of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call. Objection! Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind. My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that? As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake? It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point. Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes. If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. You're the story today. I'll take two. One for later. Well, anything coulda caused that. You think so? Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m... Still a coincidence. Timing and all. The knife. What knife? But you could be wrong. He could have climbed up earlier. Maybe...? Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence? Still lashed to the mast. Fell. Well, why does it? Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast. Tell us why that lantern would be so significant. He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts. Your daddy. Was quite a feller. I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night. This tastes horrible, hmmn? No, you don't. I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad. And it's real. I want you. To tell the truth. You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first -degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge. That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said. So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity. Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth... You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it. Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one. I think you like learning. White or black? Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars? Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare. Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare. And her farmhouse...? How is your mother-in-law? Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible . Possible that he struck his head after death. Possible? You don't. Remember . You don't. Think so. Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in? Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net. I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's? So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn? No spare. Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat? But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that? Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well. You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct? You have to wonder. Does it now? And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd? I think you testified all the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights... Right. In the middle. Of the floor. Are you absol... Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death? But you are certain that he died by drowning. And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death? Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was. Is it possible? So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have... Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same. In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes? Your report says death by drowning , which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...? Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard. So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there? The question is more about the defendant's attitu... Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques... You can speak for what he said . Just like you did for Mr. Hooks... Carl ever say he got one? Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you? Of course not. But it was emotional. A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude. I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate. So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been. Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed. So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!!

It shocks him ever time he cusses! What's the difference? I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!! She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me! That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me! What? What don't I get? What don't I get? How do we do that? Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip! How can they do this? Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny! OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!! Yeah... Yeah! Nowhere. Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! She's not my girlfriend, dude! <b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b> Where do they come up with this stuff?! This is terrible! This can't be happening!! Kyle, check it out. <b>Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for</b> Cool! You didn't? Really? Where the hell do you keep it? It's huge. My friend the clitoris told me. Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream? Wendy? Wendy? God damn it, why does she keep saying that? What's the matter, Wendy? Hi Wendy. What the hell are you talking about, kid? Yeah! WHAT?! Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy? Did you see that, Wendy? We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie! Check. Got it. Dude, you didn't say anything about watches. We're going to die here like baby mice who have had no milk in days. Dry up into crunchy little pinkies. What is it?Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words! AGH! You did? Just now? Canada is saving us!! Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco. Oh, Phillip. This cannot be good. Oh, you are such a maroon! The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it. The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US? And you call yourself a Canadian! I told you we should of done Leno! Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!! Good one, Phillip! Cheers. Hello, Brooke Shields! I sure did, Phillip!! Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights? Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience. <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b> You'd fuck your uncle! It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.' It's from your mother. Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter! Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.Watts. Those were his keys Nell found. His roommate called and said Watts left when he was supposed to. I think he's here. Just stay there, Nell! It's a question. You get your money. I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning. And those are Luke's and mine. Go ahead. I've read your tests. Because... well, I know I can trust you. Luke, can I talk to you? Yeah. I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily. You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company. And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta. This is the last chapter. Please, please give me clearance. It's for science. She needed a job, Malcolm. And she's smart. And she helps me. No. No, but she does, and that's all that matters. And after she was thrown out, she needed a job. Mary, I'll meet you outside. But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results. The deception is minor. No, Malcolm! Individual performance is only part of it. I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group... Malcolm, this is essential work I'm doing. Just think what my research can do for education. Elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read. Come on Malcolm, it's only seven ohms, it's nothing, it's like a joy buzzer! And it's not about the pain, it's about the interference with concentration... What'll happen to us, Nell? Come on. No. Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here. Nell. You will come here now. Why would we want to do that, Nell? I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it. That's what this experiment has all been about. That's what it was about, the experiment's over. I'm pulling the plug. This is my fault. Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath... What is that tune? I don't know. Someone is playing with you. You'll never see it again. Mr. Dudley's taking care of it. I'm sorry, Nell. Can I show you something you'd like to see? It was. I don't know. I wish I were. I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace. That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up. No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something. Hmm. And then what happened? Like she smelled it too? What happened after you smelled it? So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell. All right... What did it smell like? Nell! What's wrong? For an American you do a good imitation of the British at their most apologetic. Pardon me. Excuse me, sorry, sorry... How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that? The cold sensation. Who felt it first? But there's a sad catch to the story. You wrote that you had trouble sleeping. Well... we're glad to have you. Nell. Good enough. And I'm Jim. Eleanor, how was the drive? There were no children. Rene died, and then Hugh Crain built all of this, and then he died. His heart was broken. Yes. It's perfect, isn't it? That? That's Hill House. Good. Because it's my phone. Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you. See you soon. Thank you. Yes, this is Doctor Marrow. You hear the vibrations in the wire. There's a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it. I could test it. What? I'm a scientist. I just conducted an experiment. Now I have to write it up. Nell, what do we do? No. If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over. What we have to do now is be together, with Nell. I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow. I can't believe I read the test wrong. I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal. Is she asleep? Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs. Get a blanket! Mary came with me. Good morning, Theo. Luke. Every day. Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening. Have either of you seen David Watts?Can't say. Haven't been here that long. Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work. She was unhappy. Why'd she kill herself? Rene Crain. Up there. Rope. Ship's hawser. Hard to tie. Don't know how she got it. That's where she hanged herself. Mrs. Dudley'll be waiting for you. That's a good question. What is it about fences? Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable. Why would that be? Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker. What are you doing here? Me? No. What are you doing here? What do you want?CQ what? What'd you call that -- the Protector? Lookin' good. What post office? Do you have any friends, man? I've been wondering something. You think a fuckin' guy like that ever will? What more do you want, man? Too easy? Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance. You steady on, man. What the fuck else did you do back there. You goin' back inside? Faith. No one else is even here yet. I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man. Valets . They park cars. He's having a party. Those aren't guards. They're valets. That was one of them? Has he? What? Huh? Who'd you butcher at the house? Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate. Oh, Jenny was in my acting class. No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress. Before she met him. But that's not where she met me. Not in my restaurant. He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work. That's not where they met. Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. You believe that shit? Son of a bitch never smiled at me. Buried her at a "private" service. Private for who. Him? Five years, I think. Long time. Now what. You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that? Boom bam boom. You hadda show up on a weekend. This weekend. Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month. Not me, man. He don't have a concealed weapons permit. Probation? Man, you crazy. They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison. Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man? Do the background check? Go through a three-day waiting period? These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man. You're kiddin' me, right? But that's not me anymore. That's when I was into the gang lifestyle. That's not who I am now. Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man. I already told you, man. Corcoran. Know what that is? State prison. Not me, man. I'm no drug dealer, what you think. She didn't know what to say. I thought someone should say something. To someone. With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason. I felt like I owed her. You should talk to Elaine. That was her best friend. Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball. Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... Those curves don't kid around. What you gonna do, man? You gonna go to the cops? Valentine wasn't even there. If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. But I'll tell you something. She stood in front of these dudes, man. Eyeballing them . Checking them out. I felt like she was covering my ass that day. Bad place, man. Bad people. Some guys loading some trucks. Some kinda deal goin' down. I don't know and I don't care. Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos. That's what I thought, man. But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else. I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man. What d'you want from me. You kiddin', man? I don't need a wife and screamin' kids. I still got my youth. I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. I did my time, okay? My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years. Boomerang. I dunno ... Maybe they do. Coulda happened to anyone, man. I never knew her to be reckless. I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks. But that's it, nothing more than that. I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside. There was no moon that night ... I dunno. What's he gonna say? They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset? I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles. She had her life, I had mine. Terry Valentine. I never said nothin' about nothin' like that. No, no, no. That's not what I wrote to you. Huh? I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family. I mean, what has it been -- six months? I didn't expect anyone. Eduardo. Rama. I thought maybe you just came for the ride. ... Reminds me of Jennifer. Hey, Elaine. You even know what he's saying half the time? Hell, no. I started writing. Not no more, they ain't. I quit that acting shit, man. Didn't get it. I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro. Got three callbacks. Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing? Same. What d'you say, Elaine?Yeah. I really admire the guy. Well. Good to meet you. What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying? Turned that place completely around. 180 degrees. That's too bad. Ian's got a good thing going over there. You sure? I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London. Don't you work with Ian?Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace. This is un-fucking professional. What shit is this. I just do it. I don't prepare it. Where do we go? Okay. Not bad. Hey. I saw your mother on the Strip last night. She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean? I wouldn't talk. Let him break - he likes to break. While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in. Drugs? Cash? Both if we're lucky. I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- -- courier or something. Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer. But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere. "He ain't wrong." Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time. And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast. That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job. Like he'd never hire me for real. Not week-to-week. I don't have the credentials. He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial." You bet. I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation. Something's on. There's more than a measly few grand in this. Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot. Any happier than any other asshole in life. And I said so what. You think she's any happier? So what. Avery said she was tight with his daughter. The L.A.P.D. Two blacks and a Mexican in a car. Who's driving? Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching. Y'know. Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING. Or BIG FAT GUY. SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS. Wouldn't that be good? Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it. ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal. Very attractive. Good idea. Now I really want to fuck you. Jesus, are you gay enough or what. Good luck. Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores? Wow. The forever kind. Yeah. I got half. Five thousand.How we gonna get that lucky? What's in it? I don't get it. Well, we blew it, didn't we? He ain't wrong. Like what. You do? What? There is? We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand. Lemme break. What d'you mean, any happier? I dunno. I just said she's nice lookin'. She's nice lookin'. That don't mean nothin'. Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy. I don't know. Which kind? Makin' trouble for someone? Hey. How much.Because -- No. We can't find ... ... two of our guys. We think someone is here. I sure hope so. The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty. What's the matter? All your life. That happened while I swam the length of my pool. I'm a gracious host. We all did. Sure. Who? I'm sorry. That's what Gordon's always saying. It's just fuel to me. I'm not there for distractions. I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets. Salad bars. I'm not into finger foods. Too fussy. Anything but Japanese. As soon as you get dressed. It's not a compliment. I'm so glad we're having this chat. I'm not. Am I a thing? Not for you, clearly. Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty? Gordon? He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks. Is there anything in the world that you want or need? Could be worse, he could've named you Reticulum. Adhara. I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation. Well, can we make it one more. Nowhere the fuck near me. You think I'm staying? No. I mean. Not even your people should be involved. Right? It's too close now. Where do you think he is, Mike. I don't know everyone here. He was so traumatized he split. Maybe he was Gordon's pusher . As it happens. I didn't make that part up. I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds. Why, because you're my security consultant? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down. I thought he was in prison, in England. Our black friends? What kind? What. That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame. It's that simple. Go now. In a couple of days this whole thing -- Go to him. Go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, Esselin retreat, nudist camp -- Is he here? Where's ... what's-his-name -- Fred -- Susan. No trouble. Sure you do. You've made it ... brighter. I miss my kids. Exercising my visitation rights. Hello there. She could've had the deal! I would've handed it to her if she wanted. I would have given her everything. Tell you ... What. Thanks. You, too. I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were. I don't. Ah. Have we met? There's something I can't quite --Yeah? Been to the Boat Show. Just luck, this, really. Never been to one of these before. England. Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing. The lot. The whole British bloody Post Office. I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested? No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman. Lazy sods. Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn. Useless gits. I was gonna do the Post Office once. Yeah, I suppose. Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night. Meet some of the lads. Again? He's gotta know why. That would be too easy. Steady on. One thing I need. Bring the motor around. Bang out in front, right? What are we standing on? First in, first out, that's me. Well, that's what we're doin', n' it. Valets, eh? Aren't we all la-de-da. Valets. What d'ya mean valets. What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster? What's so fucking funny? See what I mean? Wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all. They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry. Watch it. Extra muscle. Bodyguards. He's brought in the heavy mob. Butcher's hook. Look. I don't much reckon those minders of his. Gate's open. I had a butcher's at the house. How'd the two of you hook up, then? And that's where you met Jenny. Hang about. I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny. Well, there you are. Jen must've liked him. It's only insurance. Can't be too careful. This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella. They were together how long? Fucking out of order, that. Shouldn't be allowed. I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one? No. Not at all. Do we? Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know. Just popped over on a quick visit. Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all. Sod that. Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to. Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know. Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded. What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages? Nick's a nick, n' it? No matter what state you're in. State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught. I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service. Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever? She didn't write to me, did she. Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they. Did Jenny know? Where abouts? What, tryin' to catch him with another bird? I only asked. This ain't your lot? Y'what? No, not my girl. Self-control, she had. Point of pride. And people don't change, do they. What more is there. Valentine. What's he got to say for himself? This bloke she was bunked up with. This Terry what'sit. No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that. Snuffed her. Who done it, then? It was better than a telegram. Round about, yeah. No reason. You're home, then. Edward Rama? Too bleeding true, 'n' it. You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble. Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... Bloke told me. That's where Valentine's scarpered. Never thought of that. Busman's holiday. Fancy it? How far? Where's Big Sur? I know that. But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it? She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for. Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out. She used to tell me she'd turn me in. Little kid. Ten year old. "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya." She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job. "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will. Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone. I can see her, the phone in her hand. Became a sort of joke between us. Only it wasn't a joke. Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. Last time might as well've been the first. I remember all the times, don't I. Watching her grow up -- in increments. I fiddle it. They got me down as an immigrant with five kids. I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole. Do us a favor. Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for? Good luck to him. He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts. You sound like my fucking probation officer. Black market during the war. Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill. Watching Doris Day. Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod. Not that I recall. I've got the hang of the driving. Found this place all right. I've 'ardly ever left it. You ever been to London? Honest. Didn't know where to look till I was 21. It's true. Has to be said. I got off to a slow start. Just now? Overnight? Get seven years, did you? Did you. What was that in aid of? I'll tell ya something: it made me a model prisoner. Put me right off any escape attempts. Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience? Not bloody likely. Hey? We were lucky to be nicked. Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday. Good job we were still breathing. A jeweller's up the West End. We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work. Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all. Would you Adam n' Eve it. I can see the attraction. Oh, I was gonna say ... Tell us about it. You don't seem bothered. Early 70's. I was away. Maidstone. Possibly Brixton. And how did you get it? How did you come to have my address? Found it, did you. Among her things. She told you all about my details but not about his. Lovely. I'll bloody well ask him. Depends, don' it. What do you think. What'd you want me to do. Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs. Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All]. Have you ever known me not to be. Why not. This and that. Y'know. Ways and means. Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. Various enterprises, style of thing. Based in London, but with international concerns. Proprietor of a London firm. Of longstanding. My employer. -- Mr. Lindgren. Now, you shouldn't run yourself down. My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me. Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it. Eight hours difference between here and London. Would've been, what, ten in the morning, my time. I was just coming out on the yard. Now, I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then. Bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that's what you wanna do. And I'll tell ya: I couldn't open the paper. Could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together. That's how weak my hands went. Thought I was having heart attack, only I knew I wasn't. Bloke come up to me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone all white. I said, fuck me, I've been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head. And I knew ... Something had happened to Jen. I already knew. Knew beforehand. When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said. Something like that, yeah. Nah, accommodation address. Nah, we split up when Jenny was six. Her second husband done a runner after she got sick. They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital. We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum. I like to think they're together again now. Y'know. Heavenly choir. Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life. On her own after her mum died. Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned. He give me your address. Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah. Me and him are muckers. Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first. No, I had -- some other matters to attend to, you know. Getting a car sorted ... Yesterday. Afternoon. Footloose and fancy free. In Jenny? 'Course not. How could I be. 'Course I wasn't. Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen. They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny. She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. Show up the old man, you know. Yeah, well, she started all that in London. How'd you manage that, then. She never told Eddie, though. Ashamed. I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me. She was always so embarrassed. When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. Oh, it just ended, then. Said it went on for donkey's years. Weren't you on a television series? Here, are you always this sarky? ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes. Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. Here, aren't you gonna let me in. Hardly buried. Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that. Sewing mailbags? Me? Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands. It was the bars, then. What was that, then? I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here. How d'you mean? Sort a few things out. Wanted to talk to you, didn't I? She used to pinch 'em off me. Funny that. One thing she never tried to get me to stop. Perhaps it was the smoke. Had a feeling it was you. And that is? As you prefer, squire. As you prefer. Oh, yeah, right. The deal. All of what? No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you. Eh? Nothing financial. Strictly personal. I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I'm concerned. A foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like. Yeah. Shouldn't wonder. Must've done. Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been me for the high jump. Your guess is as good as mine, mate. I'm here on another matter entirely. I can well believe it. I'm sure he has done, son. He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg. Look, mush, you're the guv'nor here, I can see that, I'm on your manor now, right. So there's no need to get out of your pram. I'm Johnny-come-lately to all this. Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine, it's got nothing to do with me. I don't wanna know. Yeah. Cheers, mate. Right. Chain of respect. That's good, that. No kidding. Yeah? Unless I'm not who I think I am. Sorry. Wasn't me. Ian? Yeah. But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking. Could do, yeah. I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States. Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean. Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years. Been away a lot. Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return. I would have preferred staying home, me. Yeah, that's right. Where is he, then? Is Valentine here? You know her? I have a message for him. About Jennifer Wilson. I doubt it. Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him? Walked. Why then. Why did you do it! About Jenny. Tell me about Jenny. About the deal . Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard. Tell me. Be seein' you. Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely. Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they? Forgetful. Start thinking they can get away with things. Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention. Great bloke. Really turned things around there. 180 degrees. You must know Ian. EMI in London. I work with Ian. Pleasure.Downstairs... At the front... Jesus... B-Black... F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I�ve got to get to... Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He�s got a safe... I need a doctor... Just me... Martin�s gone back to the Ambassador. Look... I don�t know. I don�t know, man. I don�t even know Friedman that well... I... Man, you�ve got to get me out of here... The company. We all work for the company. I don�t know... This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don�t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that�s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows... What kids? Finsbury Park. We�re in Finsbury Park. What? Yeah... The Diplomat. No... No... I swear... Who? Martin... He�s Martin... Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees... I don�t know. He�s gone! He�s gone. I don�t fucking know where, I swear... He�s gone. On holiday... Yes. Friedman�s the fuckin� Austrian! Who are you? Jee... Fuck... You�re fucking mad! You... Fuck you! What...?Ha-ha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says �closed to the public�, doesn�t it? Nobody? Huh!... How come? All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps? Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why�s that? Military bases? Huh. I guess there�s space enough for war games... Must be good for business. Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brother�s death. No. Thank you. I�ll be fine... You wouldn�t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you? By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress�s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared? When will they be back? Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah? De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz. That might depend on where you�re going. That�s right. The dead can wait. Why the hell couldn�t you divorce the man? Your parents arranged the visit to my office? What do you suggest? So you did talk about it, huh? Get to the point, will you... Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight. We? You and your parents killed your husband? Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother�s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will... You know something? I�ve just seen so much ugliness I don�t think I�d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time. I�d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that�s the way you want it. Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself. To get me killed...? Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little. We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it�s never that complicated really. Don�t you believe in simplicity? Where is that? What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice? Something like that? What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier�s being tailed? A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright? And you still haven�t told me why you sent me after Friedman. Are there truly no extenuating circumstances? Five years of it. Surely, you�d have divorced him if he disgusted you? Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids. Is there anything to understand? I don�t. One just doesn�t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh? Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins? You don�t say. Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He�d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too. Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You�d have been ready for me when I turned up with �Sleeping Beauty�. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. �Not Leon,� you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn�t say �My God!�, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. �Not Leon.� Who then? You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I�d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at �15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn�t you? Your brother stumbled upon Adonis�s little secret, didn�t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more. Leon didn�t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid�s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn�t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? �Leon does his own prints. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art��. I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it�s the way you say them... Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later. I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn�t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles. Leon didn�t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell. Leon�s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon�s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I�d exceeded his expectations. Adonis thought your brother�s body�d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn�t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian... Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He�s a client of mine and a friend of your husband. What do you mean, �No�, Mrs De Moraes? Tell me, did he kill his little victims too? It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What�s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children? I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being... You knew he had nothing to do with your brother�s disappearance, didn�t you? I guess the news you�d sent me after Friedman didn�t go down too well, eh? When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman�s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you? You know he�d have had him killed, don�t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married? I�ve had a long and unpleasant day. I�m tired and I�m angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leon�s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven�t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh? How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don�t learn to pick locks between shopping trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn�t suit you! Who knew I�d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who�d want to make sure it didn�t fall into the wrong hands? You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT? Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can�t satisfy him? What�s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children? Black suits you. Aren�t you curious to know about Friedman? You�re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes. Why don�t you ask when I left the Mondrian? How are you, Mrs De Moraes? Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes... Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes. Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I�ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right? Are you all right? The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code... Have you got a pen? You do want me to keep the job, don�t you, Mrs De Moraes? Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really. The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot. You watched the tape? Friedman and his people don�t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They�re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise. Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:... Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I�m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it. The man who sold the boy to your brother. You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles. Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you? You drive a hard bargain. Couldn�t Nazi hunters do the job? Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes? I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes. Perhaps I should come back when you�re... Excuse me? The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes. Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother�s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he�d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news... I can�t tell you that yet. But he�s being well looked after. I will of course do my best to hang onto it. I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning? Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You don�t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he�s either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I�ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I�m here at such a late hour. I need �20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning. You seem surprised. Could it be you don�t think that badly of him after all? You needn�t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse. There�s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for �15,000. It�s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I�m told it retails at around �4,000. I see you don�t require a definition. I found this at your brother�s. Can it be that you want your brother found? Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes. I don�t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined. I�m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother�s in trouble. Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The �1,000. You gave it to him in cash? Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan? What about you, Mrs De Moraes? And that is the last time any... Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes. Can you tell me how you spell... A call box? That�s odd. Where exactly? Yes. I�m trying to reach a friend but I can�t get through. The number is 01766 770 471. The word for those things is croissants. Croissants. Like that... Croissants. A coffee and a couple of croissants. Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me. I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband? They�d never let me go. And you�d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me. What about your friendly cop? It�s up to you whether they walk or not. Then find another way. I�m finished here and I�m tired, Emily. You shouldn�t be here. Now don�t make it worse. Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house? Do you know a friendly cop? No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up... Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime. Some Italian I picked up back there. He�s in the boot of the Mustang. Friedman�s dead... They killed him... What... Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There�s a lot of people back there. They�re holding a seminar. Trafficking�s the past, breeding the future... Who�s the guy? Who�s the guy! Nom de Dieu! Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I�d have had to kill him. I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn�t come close to how bad it is. Bye now. Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There�s a dirt track with a �Closed to the public� sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven�t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear? Get a pen and don�t ask any questions. Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause... Yeah. Goodnight, Emily. Thank you. But I think I�ll go to bed. It�s been a long day. Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence... A criminal? Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem... Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we�re doing here? I�m sure I�ll find a way. Hah... What about Nathalie? I wouldn�t mind. Thank you. I know where to look. I thought you�d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There�s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me... Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I�d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog... No. A poor little rich boy who thought he�d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition. Yeah. The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence. French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn�t have any. I used a British passport. My name�s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard. Well, I�d sooner mug an old lady... A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me. You�re sure you won�t sit down, Miss Stewart? You wouldn�t have a cigarette, would you? Europe... France. I�m French but I live in London... ... England. ... Fine. I�ll go for the safe place. I see. How much? Tomorrow? What about an untrained pup, white... Yes... Good, good... Yeah. What sort have you got? Why? I saw the ad at George�s. I�m passing through town and I�m in a hurry. I�m calling about the puppies. Where is it? What colour is your car? What colour is your car? What about the staff? They�re in on what�s going on, aren�t they? How many of them? What�s the Ambassador? How many of you scumbags are here? What company? And who does Friedman work for? There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five? Where are the kids? Where are we? Where? What�s this place? A hotel of some kind? Ever seen him before? Who�s the money man? ...On holiday? Where is he? Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian? You�re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian? Where is the Austrian? On the bed! You sure you passed on my message? Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that? Does Mr Gluck call for his messages? Can I have the reception desk, please. I�ll call again. Thank you, Jane. Carlos De Moraes? Hello, Jane. It�s me. I�d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can�t, don�t worry about it. I�ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I�m in a hurry. Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you�re my secretary, all right? Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It�s important. It�s not. Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I�d given you and then got back, remember? I can�t find it. Do you know where it is? Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, tr�s bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommand�mes services �quelqu�un r�cemment... Vous �tes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie... Bye bye, Jane. And don�t be naughty. I�ve got work tonight, Jane. Well, I hope you�re not too heartbroken and... It�s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend? That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. Should I? La what? Good. No. How are you, Jane? Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did. Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy�s education. Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation? Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz? My rates... I�m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen? Any friends? I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz? Then why aren�t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz? So he could have decided to go on a trip... Did you look for his passport, driving licence? I presume you checked your son�s apartment... I didn�t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz. Check with your son�s bank. Banks don�t usually give out information about their customers. How did you do that, Mrs Spitz? What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz? I take it your son is called Leon? Look Mrs Spitz... I don�t know to whom I�m indebted for the recommendation but... I�m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz. Okay. Recommended... Didn�t you say I came recommended? That�s what I thought. May I know by whom? Recommended? Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn�t like to think I�d kept you waiting for nothing. I hope it�s not too significant. May I...? Good afternoon, Mrs...? The Hyatt...? What�s that? Trying to say something, Martin? What is? You seem very sure about that. Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag. You�ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he�s using? Is this Friedman? Could someone have hurt you that bad? You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die. I�m overcome by your public-spiritedness. Maybe I don�t. Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin? Is it real? You people are sick. Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let�s go... Shut up and drive! Don�t jump any red lights. Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador? Where is Friedman? This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him. Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours. Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate. Let�s go. Is my money in there? Does it matter? Anything at all? What happens now? What are you talking about? What is it? Three o�clock. Yeah. I�ll be alone. Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I�d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we? An Austrian. The lady�s not a friend. She�s a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies. I don�t recollect mentioning a friend. Have you? Should I come back in five minutes? Yes. You wouldn�t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave. Oh. This is... We�d arranged to meet tonight and I�m due to return to Paris tomorrow... Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his... No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please? Good. You needn�t worry about the Austrian anymore. He�s dead. I�ll be in touch. How�s the boy doing? You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy? Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work? The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash? Did he ever refer to the hostility between them? I�ve been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister? What�s the date? No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon�s story about the boy? You just took his word for it? And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon�s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he�d have found you before I did. I can�t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What�s your sister�s number? Is she on the phone? Who else knows about the boy? Do you know Leon�s parents names? I�m afraid I don�t understand. His mother would be pleased to hear that. Good reasons? Did Leon tell you why he didn�t want the police involved, Rhian? Shut up! Haven�t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I�d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble. Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon�s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him. As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him. Can I get up now? Should I be? In my jacket. Left inside pocket. Is this some kind of mugging? Because... It�s wet. Will this do? How are you, Rhian? Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn�t appeal to you... I�d appreciate it if I could use your phone. Los Angeles? I... How long have I been here? No... Fucked-up fucking weird. Could that be Camden Market? Would you know where I might reach her? Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent. What about his girlfriend? I know his work better than I know him. I take it you don�t know where he is, then? Uh-huh. Excuse me? If you can, send me a receipt. I don�t have your credentials, Nathalie. But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable. Le montage, l�emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors� stuff. How much would it cost me? Alors? Mon bureau co�tait trop cher. Tu sais o� me trouver. Viens. What�s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie! Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr�- pubescents. Don�t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards. Shut up and walk... You�re sure he said his caller was a man? What sums? Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call. Try again, and this time be polite. So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me? I think you�d rather not know what I think. So why didn�t he? Are you telling me Friedman didn�t tell you I was here looking for him? Nice way to help a colleague in trouble. Why did you kill him? Why did you kill Friedman? The acid bath? Three... Five seconds. Then you die. Gluck. Okay, shitbag. I�m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman? Mossad? Are they still operative? They lost their son. Why? Moreau? C�est moi. Alors...Very funny. Can I go on now? What do you think? Costliest! Ha ha... Yes. With prices reaching an all time low, the name of the game has become �have-it- where-it�s-at�... As we all know, transportation has always been the costliest and trickiest part of this business...Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha... I don�t know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh? What�s that? A word? Cost what?Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He... Hyatt... Friedman�s... at the Hyatt... Dying without ever reaching the top... I told you... The rabble, it�s me... Huh... It�s sad. You�re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy�s not one of Friedman�s... Who are you? Who are you working for, huh? Huh... I�m sure there�d be lots of takers. Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they�re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you? Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can�t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines. Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not. Huh. I�d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the client�le. Get rid of them and we�re out of business. You�re out of your mind. What�s the idea? This car needs petrol. No. In Hampstead... Why? Look, I don�t think you�re fully aware of what you�re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don�t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh? Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble... Clients come and go. Am I supposed to know him? I don�t know what your problem is, but... Uh-huh. You could�ve waited for me inside. Problems? Vous �tes Fran�ais? Anything at all. I presume you won�t want to take the boy with you when you�re finished? There�s a �500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand? The room�s yours for 24 hours. It�s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like. We conclude our transaction.Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists? You go to your world, I�ll stay in mine. So long, Mister. Barstow�s 30 miles to the left. Los Angeles a hundred to the right. Wherever you�re heading, I reckon somebody�ll pick you up. I�m sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldn�t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you�re told otherwise. And for what it�s worth, I wouldn�t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I�d sooner shoot you than have you upset me... Los Angeles is 100 miles away. Huh... I guess you ain�t quite ready for civilisation yet... I�ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you�re on your way. Three days and that�s three days too many.Come on. Get your ass up. Now, can you stand up? Can you use your legs and stand up? I didn�t think so. The rags on their sorry backs are the only wordly possessions those wretched creatures are ever found with... I don�t wanna know who you are or how come you ended up roasting in Owl Canyon. But you might as well know I�d have let you fry to a buzzard meal if not for this... And you ain�t neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?Fine... He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street... ... No. In fact, I�d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn�t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know... ... No. Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still... He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn�t... It hurt him. They used to be close... Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... �Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another,� Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter... Er... Yes... The nineteenth... How come you didn�t know? He�d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... �Sleeping Beauty�. The Disney film... Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn�t watch... I�m sorry. It�s just you don�t look local... Oh, I... She just moved. I�ve got her new... It�s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you. Yes...You-you�re not going to take Shiva away? My sister... She lives in the next valley. Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why? They�re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It�s not guilt, more of a curse... And then there�s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that�s just one of Leon�s dark delusions... Yeah... But he didn�t beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent�s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims. That�s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn�t take on another child, that he�d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn�t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he�s back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people�s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon�s. He did beat the drug, though. He did. He just said he had good reasons. We didn�t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though... What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you he�s terrified of men, so... You-you�re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I�m in London. That�s all. You thought wrong. I haven�t seen Leon for months. ...Leon�s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn�t know where I live. No! What do you want here? How do you know me? What�s a French private investigator doing here? A private investigator... You�re not Austrian? Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger�s on the trigger, you hear! Shut up! Where�s your wallet? Where�s your wallet? Have you got a wallet? This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.Nobody's going to hurt you. Turn the car around. What's in the other direction? Where were you going? You speak English? DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH!? It's like I said; you don't really know lieutenant John Epps very well, do you? If I give it to you, will you let us go? So you can give us away? Just keep quiet. You don't know John Epps very well, do you? That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert. Tell me something, Wes. Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid? Jaeger says you're crazy. Wes-- Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next. Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good. We thought-- What about Jaeger? Suppose I don't go for that? And let me guess who is. Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand. We been down this road. I told you how it is. Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it... I out rank you, that's why. No. It's murder, and I won't be any part of it. I've got no stomach for murder. We are not at war! You and I and Jaeger are AWOL. We have no authority-- I'm not going to let you kill him. You're out of your mind. You don't know that. You said he was a deserter. Doesn't matter. Whatever he wanted he didn't get it. We've got no need staying around here. It's light enough. Let's pack up and head out. How's he going to want the gold? He couldn't even know we had it. Why'd he come in our camp. Stop it! What happened? Get off him! Get off him. Then get up and do something about it. I told you: When I straighten someone out they stay straightened. This is how it works: Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed? Maybe I do. You've had your say, Wes. Now leave it. We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now. What about it? It'll be too dark to make our way back now. Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light. All right. I'll go up, then you send up the gold and-- I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins. Wes!? We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back. I heard! Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up. Doesn't hurt to have a look out either. All right. Let's break out some utility shovels, lanterns, and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting. Me and Jaeger'll climb down, and see what we can see. Move! So we wait. I don't know. There's a lot of space up here. They could be just about-- Basically. But the map has been pretty precise so far. I don't think it'll be too hard to-- Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive. Should be easy going from here. Stay on the pass straight to the dot. Let me see the map. Picks up again just on the other side. Not much of a pass. We're not going to find anything standing here. Let's get to climbing. All we've got to do is make it to the top. There's nothing we can do. We shouldn't even be here in the first place. I don't want to see people killed any more than you. But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die. There's nothing we can do. All right. Let's get out of here. Ready? You just go when I say go. Break it out. We've got rope? Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay? Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up. Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces. I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it. How tough you have to be to make the army? All you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet. He's not so-- Maybe we are crazy for doing this. But if we do it, we do it right. I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again. You two fighting's not going to get us anything. Low on gas. Got to refill. They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying. This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters. They shouldn't have been here. Wha... We're going to keep driving. Why, yes, Jaeger. I believe it is. I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there. Yeah! Welcome to beautiful Iraq. Land of enchantment and riches. I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here? 'Cause I got tired of being president of GM? If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say. Better grab up some sand to take home to your family. A casual one. There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire. Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory. It's a fortune box. Can you eat it? If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is. Like learning Arabic? You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here. You know so much about the Middle East, you know where we can get something to eat. Not up to us. Up to the Iraqis. All they have to do is get out of Kuwait. He's going to slow down. He'll slow down. We'll make up some kind of lie. They won't find the gold. That's what I hear. Don't matter. Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold. I'd go to Australia. Lot of land, not many people. I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile. And the girls go crazy for brothers down there. Australia. How the hell should I know? I don't know. Thought you were going to buy a car. What? Don't make so much out of it. Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive. Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had. I'm no better than anybody else. I've just been busier. Threatened to blow my brains out? Thanks. Yeah. Then I'm a rich man. Somebody has to. You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt. When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head. A car's got to come along sooner or later. When it does, we jack it. You shouldn't think about things like that. It'll just make you crazy. We had a deal. No one touches the gold until we're out of here. No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about. It's always been like that. When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions. I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack. Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own. It wasn't the gold. It was the claymore mine. The gold's in my pack. Damn it. We lost the horses. We go this way. No, but I figure now's a real good time to start. Me? I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid. ...Wes...? You come up with a better plan, let me know. With what? Against how many? I don't know! I don't know. They killed Wes. Shi'ites, I think. We keep going, that's what we do. We ignore them, maybe they ignore us. Sun rises in the East. We go the opposite direction. May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia. We can't stay here. Even if that wasn't an Iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up. Get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot. An Iraqi? Shoot them! Don't go bitch on me now! You were going to kill me. Kill them! I don't have a weapon. Well, you're going to start with a bang, 'cause you've got four of them to take down. And then shoot them. Slip out your M-16. They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them. They couldn't tell in the dark. They must be Saudis. It's a Saudi checkpoint. Oh sweet, Jesus. Come on. Come on! What did you say? That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over. Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile. Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war. They don't want any trouble. Well, we should identify ourselves. We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold. Couldn't be Syria. We couldn't have gone that far north. It's got to be Saudi. Come on. Place all alone like that? Must be a boarder check point. The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here. Don't you touch it. We've got to keep moving while there's still light. No! It's a desert. That's what deserts do at night; they get cold. Okay. Then we go this way. We can't just sit here. We've got to start moving, so pick. It's got to be going better than this.. If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that. But we won't make another day otherwise. Damn. It's all right. I don't like it, but it's over now. Makes two of us. Yeah. You still got a map on you? Sure. Yeah. Well, me too. Is it all right if I stand up? That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death. And you; you've got it all together. First Wes, now you? We'll lie. What do you mean no? They can fly us home. We need something: A flare, a signal mirror. What if he's not? We can't just leave him. We got to go back. We got to go back for Wes. We'll find our way! We'll... We'll find our way. You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it. We're heading Northeast. There's another pass on the photo. We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up, and it should get us back down. We should head Northeast. It stays as it is. We're halfway home now. Let's not blow it by people getting ideas. Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not. What the hell took so long. All right. You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow. Someone's got to send the gold up. It can't get on the line by itself. Jesus, Jaeger. He's not going to leave us. What? What? I wouldn't know. I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this. Yeah, Bwana, you got it. It's just a mongoose. It's giving. I feel air. Probably opens up outside somewhere. That's where the light comes from. Couldn't see it with the lanternon. Get up off your ass and dig! Get up and dig. It looks like you're not doing anything. What are you doing? A whole lot of nothing. Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns. If they land, we can take them. If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about. They can't shoot us in here. We're not going to do anything. Just stay down. Stay low. I hope it means something, otherwise... Something like that. Not enough. We're out numbered and out gunned. They'd cut us to shreds. They're doing more than slapping. Well, it's Iraq. I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here. Iraqis. A bunch of them. Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on. Don't! Shut up and listen! I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. We're in this together, understand? You're not losing trust, are you? This. Whatever it is. If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps. Wes is right. If there were any more mines we would have found them. Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran. When we start running suck up your breath. You're going to get the wind knocked out of you. You're going to be fine. Me and Wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine. It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up. It's not falling asleep. You've only been standing there for three minutes. I said nobody dies. Nobody dies. There's a way. I said be cool, all right? Now be cool! We're going to be right over here. Me and Wes are just going to talk. We're going to get off, all right. We'll get you off of there. Just...be cool. Just relax. Just be cool. If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore. You didn't step on any mine. What? What!? Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours. Faster we get there, faster we get back. SAY IT! What do we do with the Humvee? And you missed this? How are you going to miss something like this? Look at it. LOOK AT IT! Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight. I told you to check for damage. It'd make their heads explode. You can't tell anybody about this. What? Let's go. She okay? I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand! Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them. It's the only way. We drive! We run they'll shoot us anyway. If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis. Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going. We can see them, they can see us. We run, they chase. Shut up! Both of you shut the hell up! TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS! Take the binoculars. You know, you sound just like a boy who's never-- It's not about being fun. It's about being smart. You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever. That's freedom. That's what I'm talking about. Invest it. You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels? A car? You're going to buy a car? Third. What you're going to do with your third. But that's the great thing about Gold. A little goes a long way. Cool it, Jaeger. Hey, Wes? Wes? Now this is war. It's going to be cool, Wes. It's all all right. But we all got to be in for this. We all go, or we do nothing. It's war. People get lost all the time in war, cut off-- And you know what that area is? It's Iraq. IRAQ! We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm. Maybe you've read about it. Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer? I think you've got some issues to deal with. Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you. Don't even. You're not going to show me that tired map. Everybody's got a job to do. Figure it this way: At least you get to go home alive. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. Let's get out of here. We got sand to protect. What!? What!? You all want to lay off? God. I hope the Iraqis shoot me; put me out of my misery. Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting? Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge. Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that. Don't worry about Jaeger. He uses his personality as a form of birth control. Another month in this desert and I might just. You know what? I think you got Schwarzkopf. You did! You got the General right in the ass. Now that's good shooting. No you're not. Ready for what? What are you supposed to be doing? Knock it off! What are you doing?He's not slowing. Epps, I don't think he's slowing down. Well, this is it. We get the car, find some Americans. We find Americans we'll be all right. Really? What? I've never been anywhere. I wouldn't know where to go. Where would you go? Still am. There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now... Where should I go? I'm thinking about taking a trip. Epps? Yeah. Even after that. You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now. But I'd say you've been very fair. I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple. This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes. You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here. And you've been fair too. I mean, even after I...you know... I want you to know... I don't know. I just think you're a hell of a guy. Epps. Yeah, but why me? What if the car doesn't stop? Why do I have to lie in the road? How do we do that? Well? What if it hadn't been Wes? What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had... But... When did you make the switch? The...the gold... Which way do we go!? Can you ride a horse? I didn't say that. I never said-- You were shot. We were standing right there, you were shot! Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us. We can't just sit here waiting to die. ...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out. Why haven't they killed us!? Is that good, or bad? What do you make of them? What do we do? To where? What do we do? I don't know. He didn't have a uniform on. He...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed Wes. I just said I would. I don't think I-- Can't you-- I...I never killed anyone before. I told you that. And then what? What are we going to do? Oh, God... I don't know. Something Wes had taught me. I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends." Probably. Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us. Probably. Yeah, I guess we should. Well? Epps. What if they're not Saudi. Which boarder? Saudi? Kuwait? Syria? What do you figure it is? Yeah, but we made that deal while Wes was still alive. He's gone. Time for a new deal. I just want to look at it. Remind me of what I'm dying for. You know what I'm going to do? I'm just going to take a second. I want to look at the gold. Just let me rest for a second. Epps...Epps! I'm gonna stop for a second. Getting cold. I pick that way. You sure you want me too? Wonder how the war's going? What do you think our chances are? Sorry. I never had anything before, Epps. I never was anybody. Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins. When I was in high school I used to-- I know what I did just now was crazy, but you got to understand how much I want that gold. I don't want to die. Epps? What? Yeah. Really, I'm not. Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis? That's all it was was talk. I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine. I never killed anybody before. I talk a good game, but I'm not like that. I'm glad I didn't have to kill you. I'm glad it didn't come to that. I'm sorry about that, Epps. I don't want it this way. I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me. Not when we're so close. I'm not like Wes. Wes was crazy. They'll search the pack. They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here. No. No. Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him. He was going to kill you. He was one blink away from it. He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass. Wes is dead! Forget Wes. How!? What are we going to do? How are we going to find our way back!? It should, or it will? Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against. Northeast? That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi. Wes might be right about that. Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line. It didn't seem that long. Yeah. Yeah, that'll work. I don't see how that plan's any better. Why do I have to stay down here? What's to stop him if he wanted to? All he has to do is cut the line... We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here? Wait. You don't have to imagine it. Not anymore. Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you. It's not like I figured. It's cold. And it's heavier than I imagined. Is it dead? Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore. Must be a compartment. We've been digging. We've been digging for hours. If there was anything here to find we would have found it. I'm not. And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here. What does it look like I'm doing? So where do we start? Think there might be more Iraqis? If they land-- They're going to kill us! What are we going to do? What the hell are we going to do? Where the hell is it!? Where is it? Where'd it go? But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something. X marks the spot. So good bye, Shi'ites. Thanks for playing. We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go. The Shi'ites are on our side? I didn't know that. What are they doing in the middle of nowhere? What are they doing here? It's a fire fight. I don't hear any-- Yeah, I understand. Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. That's a sweet deal. Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it. It's the treasure, that's what it is. You don't know that. It could be a trick. You're going to blow yourselves up. Don't let me die, Epps. I don't want to die. You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die! That's going to do it, right? I'm going to be okay. How's this going to work? I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep. My leg is falling asleep. Epps, my leg is falling asleep. Epps... You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? It's going to blow up! Why you got to move away to talk!? Where you going? How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!? It's a mine, isn't it? Oh, God! Oh God! I heard it. I heard it click. Mine. Land mine! Mine. I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. Just a sip. I'm gonna...I'm just gonna stop for a little water. Yeah. I know. I'm with you. Hey...hey! Slow up. You don't have to go so fast. I got that...sir. We leave it. I didn't miss it. I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back. ...I know. Millionaires, man. I know. I know. But I'm saying, if they knew. We're going to be millionaires, man. Millionaires! I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing. I mean if they knew what we were coming back with. Yeah. Yeah, she's fine. Steady it out! Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy. You're cool. They're not going to-- They'll shoot us! We've got to do something. We've got to turn around. Wh-what do you think-- And I'm talking about enjoying myself. Oh, that's fun. What are you going to do with your third ? Yeah. I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it? I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray. All tricked out and cherry. I'm going to be so sweet. You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold? You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army? Roger that. We go, we get rich, we go home. It's that easy. We disappear for awhile. We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing. What we're doing is kicking ass. For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews. The war is over. We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers. Christ! Wes, tell him. You know this stuff. Just listen to me! I've been doing some reading. In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks. It became part of the Ottoman empire. When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff. Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards. They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes. I read about this, man. I read about it. Wait. Wait. I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt. They finally start the ground war, and where are we? Same place we've been since we got here. Securing freedom for the dirt. You think? I did it! I got the box open. OH MY GOD! I've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted for nothing in the first place. This is stupid. It's going on a month now. How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards? They can bomb them all they want, Saddam ain't going anywhere without a ground assault. What the hell is the army waiting for? There might be. There might be something in there. Blow me. Have I said that to you guys recently? Blow me. Blow me. I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis. Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts. At-at-at-at-at. What does it look like I'm doing? I'm killing Iraqis. At-at-at-at-at. At-at- at-at-- At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at. Saddam's got a boil on his ass? Some good ones. The photos. Just...want to be ready when we do. I could use some recon photos too. I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi. Woods. We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there. Think the Iraqi's killed them all? You're going to burn up in those. Maybe we ought to...you know, bury him. Say some words over him. So we'll take him with us. At least 'til we get back to the Hummer. I think he wants something to drink. Maybe we should give him some water. He lived through that? With what? He doesn't have a weapon. I think we found something. Yeah, we're down. Guess we know what the next stop is. Lines up with the map and the photos. Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them. Think we can make it? I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all. Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold. So? I know you're a pussy. I know that. Jesus! What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis. Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis? Anytime you want to do something about it just let-- Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you. That don't mean nothing. Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear. Until we're out of the mine field is how long. Epps... You have to go with us. You can't walk back... You have to go with us, Wes. As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway. We're not that far. We can make it. We're not stranded. We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back. ...I figured...I figured you'd turn back. We're not going anywhere. Not 'til we get what we came for. Yeah, well, we're not. You see that? Right by us. They went right by. You had them Epps; you called it. Yeah! Yeah! They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here! Two vehicles. They're not supposed to be here. Iraqis. A car is not just a car where I come from. I had this friend, had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang-- You know what I'm doing with my half? Yeah! Gold! How much? Yeah. If. Whatever. What kind you figure it is? Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried? Epps, is that a sand dune. Hell, we'll just buy our way out. Yes! You know it's real. You know it's real, and you know it's there. You know it. It's real. I'm telling you, it's real. It's about a hundred miles from where we are now. How long do you think it would take us to-- It's right here. This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos. There're no troops there, no fighting-- With...with millions. Millions of dollars. We...we could go home with something else. That's it. It's over. Eighteen hours into the war and it's over. It's...it's...I don't know what it is. You know what, Wes? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war. At-at-at-at-at. At-at-at-at-at. The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box. I've got a treasure to find. Come on, man. I almost had this thing open. What!? It doesn't mean anything. What's your point, Wes? You have a point? Like I said; so? Yeah. So? What? I don't care if there's a lump of coal in here. I just want to be able to rub Epps' face in it when I crack this thing. I'll show Epps. He'll be sorry when I get this thing open. Naw, nothing. I could. For real? A treasure? Yeah, you're funny. What is it? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is. What is this? How do you say "Come here, baby. I'm horny." I can use that now. What does that mean? Spanish wasn't hard enough? It was an accident. You saw it was an accident. Oh yeah. Accidently. When do you ever point the soles of your feet at people? People are suffering. We ought to kick their asses anyway. Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses. Okay. I'm making you uncomfortable. Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you. But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull. A headache?I'm sure we will. What is this? A whole new train? All right, all right... It'll be okay. I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam. The machine was stopped! It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?! Oh, I see, an easy plan! My God! He's so excessive! God in heaven, what is that?! My hat is off to you, sir. Of course not. It was in your book. Oh, well, then let's kick some ass! I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men? I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers! What? President Grant is...! My pleasure. Excellent detective work, sir. You should have the honor of going first. What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim? Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty. You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it? I adjusted it. My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case. I spent three years on the stage, you know. Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear. This? I'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds. Relax. We're almost there. Got to be somewhere that's hot. He said it was "damnably hot." It's a town! Willard... Yes. And a much nicer one than ours. What's this? You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen. It is? Oh, damn! That's it. Shhh! Come on. Tell us something! A cylinder recorder. My own design. Know what this is? You go ahead. I'll stick with Loveless. Thank you. Can you fill me in here? They're so precious when they're asleep. Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded. I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun. Uh... how long ago was this? So... what happened? Well... that, too. So... spontaneous. All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot. If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are? Which is why we're heading to Houston, Texas. Home of the Loveless Steam Engine Works. Jim, are you all right? That's right... That's good. Damn it, this is ridiculous. Hey, I tried the board. It's a repeating steam cannon! Could I just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention. Garrison...? Then the President was right. Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again. All that jumping and kicking. What was all that back there? Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it. Now, what was that? Come on, Jim. I'm serious. Dot... Dash. It'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it. Yes. Now, observe.... You know your Morse Code almost as well as I. Then we've got our proof. Excellent. And where do we find this fortunate scientist? Whoa, Jim. Maybe. But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe. Quite. Come, let's mingle. Jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as I, Chauncey McNeil Armstrong, English lyric poet. Come Llewellyn, don't tarry. My disguise. And here... Doyle, once around the park. I need a moment to prepare. Absolutely. Have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women. Limestone quarry? Yes. Starting with a screw. Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but... Potentially. This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues. The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology. Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain. Yes, aha. A brass screw. Aha! I'll work on it. Well... it's the only one I have. It's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots... Try what? Good Lord, man. The world is changing. And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention. We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace! Always hoping. Or this... Attractive buttons, yes? But yank one off, toss it, and poof! It emits a cloud of sleeping gas. "Gadget guy?" While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science. Sorry. Didn't mean that. Just a little device of mine... "Ay, there's the rub." Take a look at this file on Professor Morton. Quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy. A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes? Or maybe just someone who hates scientists. Eight scientists. Eight different fields of endeavor. Hydraulics, optics, ballistics... Wouldn't dream of it. If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco. Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same. Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir. And best of luck in all your future endeavors. Interesting. Mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk... Congratulations. Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark. Valet? You jest of course. I am a U.S. Marshal. Artemus Gordon. Bach, he's the composer. J. S. Bach. Time for you to get off, Ma'am. Well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid... But it only has six legs. You didn't tell us you had this on! You? Dr. Pemberton? Of course. How novel. Terribly sorry. I'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong. Federal agents, ma'am. We're rescuing a kidnap victim...Well, we'll stay in touch... you know. Well, sure. Didn't you get your orders? Artemus! Look at that. Brand spanking new. She's a beauty, huh? Let's get rolling. In the next two minutes? He was going to shoot me! Do you mind?! Pull the balloon right in front of him! We'll board the damn thing! Where have you been? That's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts! Thank you. Are those just button buttons or...? Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance. There's only seventy-eight. We've got to stop him right here, now! With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter. I know! I know! Artemus, you ready for this? His next target is Albuquerque. Oh, thank you. Not likely. There must be tracks of twenty different wagons. Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards... When we find him, he is mine. So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand? Not again. And people are actually fooled by that? What is that? We oughta get a couple of those rockets. Voom! We're there before we left! Damn, I wish this thing would go faster. That rules out Willard, Vermont; Willard, Minnesota... Willard, New Mexico? It's not a guy... Sounds like a train. Looks like a train. No record of him. He's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named Willard. It's better than nothing. This is good. Sure. It's a wind-up... thing. Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton. Sure. We have no idea what's going on. You really enjoy yourself, don't you? I find most criminals slip up somewhere... You might have mentioned you had that. I was six. And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later. Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back. Nothing much to it really. When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys. I saw them coming. But I didn't act fast enough. Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly. "Spontaneous." I like that. Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch." What way is that? No, I'm not all right. They got away. And we can't even follow them. They can get off the tracks anywhere they want. At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it. Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting. At least I tried something. Never seen a gun fire so fast! I'm going to hit you. And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it. That? Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco. Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me I've got a book on it, if you're interested. All what? You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello." You feeling all right? Almost? All right. How about this? We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him... Doctor V. L. Pemberton. I knew it. He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine. I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man. Do your own mingling. I'm not hanging around with some dandy named Chauncey. That's a lot of butler. Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong. Prepare what? Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party. What about the explosive? Starting with a screw? Is this leading somewhere? Aha? That should put us ahead of the criminals. Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful. All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that. No offense, but all I ever need... Are these... And this. You need that real often? Wait a minute. Now I know where I've heard of you. You're the gadget guy. Then why kidnap them? Why not just kill them? Put them all together and what do we have? But don't pull that again. You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy. But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment. Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are. So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened? Your train? Listen, friend, you're obviously lost. ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime. Funny. So am I. I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something? Jim West. You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me. You bring the best out in a man. Really? Like General Garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting? I've had some practice. Oh, I would hope not. Just a little insurance... against the unexpected. I suppose so. But life can be hard for a man, too. Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type. You tell me. I don't like to lose, either. Well, I owe you one, don't I? Your guests, ma'am? Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory. Texas. Please do. I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm. You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle. My name's Tyler. Frank Tyler. Pleased to meet you, ma'am. I would, Mr. Doyle! Are you game? My friend? Private train? Look, I'm Captain James West... Where'd he say he was going to do this? ... well, of course you can. Mr. President, what a surprise. What brings you here? And? Nicely said, sir. But what would anyone have to gain from all this...? Unless it were a foreign power. Nice to finally meet you, sir. Good work. Really. Mr. President, good to see you again, sir. Sorry about all that. Easy now. So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer? Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you? "Emperor Miguelito...?" That would be... the Mexican War? The U.S. is my jurisdiction. Has it penetrated yours that I'm holding a gun on their leader? You got that right. Now get up. We're walking out of here. He had a pressing engagement. You're not that big. Dr. Loveless? Why don't we just cut this routine short? Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk. How embarrassing. Did I hold up three fingers? I deal with some tough customers. No, sir... just a businessman. I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant. I admire a man with a sense of humor. I beg your pardon? Now it's a bomb. This is something. He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out. Are you all right? A glass eye? That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison. Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army. I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him. He used to wear an eye-patch. Who was this partner of his? We'll explain on the way. Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe. Dr. Pemberton? Right. You're not going to use it, are you? In an hour they're gone! When are they coming? Well?Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs. I could get used to this, looking down on people. Wonderful! Our new friend from the wild west. Please... Anyone? A new friend? Easy? Easy? On just what grounds should I take it easy!? Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West! A town a day will disappear! Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park. Next, I level all of Albuquerque! Yes, that's right. Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there. What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me! After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire! The first. I've even printed my own currency. Call it what you like. The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West. It belonged to my beloved grandmother! Now I intend to have it back. My own country! These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression. Exactly! You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces. Or haven't you checked a map lately?! Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers? You are in my domain! Philistine. Still alive. Hmm. I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno. Restrain yourself, Voltaire. He's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant. ... And do give me some room, Voltaire. You're breathing on my head! I hate it when you breath on my head! Talk? About what...? Oh! About who you are and all that? Sir... I believe you have only two barrels. Really? Must be a dangerous business. Very good, sir! I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade. Thank you. I confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says I cannot have. When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?I love Christmas in Turkey. We�ve got to get out. Count to twenty. I�ll be there. Count to twenty. When you get to twenty open the hatch. It can only be opened for a few seconds or we�ll sink. Just wanted to put him on edge... Like riding a bike. He�s sealed himself in. We go down to the torpedo bay. If I don�t get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden�s Tower, M is dead. Elektra would control it all. Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world... Made to look just like an accident. Nuclear. She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now. And M�s life is part of the bet. I was hoping you could tell me. Makes her look even more innocent. Elektra King. It�s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack. The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium. I did kill us. She thinks we�re dead. And she thinks she got away with it. Then it�s no longer a bomb? Alright then, brunch. When this is over we should bury the hatchet. Celebrate. A champagne dinner? With this? Bond -- Shame you had to spot I wasn�t the real thing. Here�s your imposter. He�s paid off the men on the plane outside. They�re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they�re flying it wherever he tells them. Couldn�t make it. Splitting headache. Don�t know any doctor jokes. Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...? I could come for a second opinion? Perhaps after this ... test? It�s just a scratch. I need you to pass me fit now, Molly. Is maybe...the inside woman. They�re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons? I can�t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin... The report King bought. It�s a manual. Renard�s men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead. The worm on the hook again. He�s not through yet. Renard doesn�t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there�s more coming in. He�s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline. And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you. �That which does not kill me makes me stronger.� He survived? Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist? Renard. Who? The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra. I was the one who brought that money in... I took the initiative. Caviar capital of the world. Matchless beluga. Firm, yet subtle. Largest landlocked body of water on Earth. Oil-rich. Hitler wanted it. Stalin beat him to it. It�s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall. She�s not a girl anymore. Who buys classified reports for three million pounds. Old friend? Construction�s not exactly my line. The name? Your last chance. Give me the name. And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss. Who did you get it from? Which is neutral, no doubt. Haven�t you heard the news? So is she. She�ll get over it. Consider me ungrateful. You will never touch her. You will never get near her. Who is it? Revenge isn�t so hard to fathom. What�s clever is getting someone else to pay for it. Indeed. I�m sorry. You knew him well? Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs. Yes. One... last... screw? Elektra, it�s not too late. Eight million people needn�t die. No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident. Was this all about the oil? So you killed your father. You turned Renard. All this, because you fell for Renard? Where�s M? Not interested. I�m coming with you. He used your exact words. I think you do. You can drop the act, it�s over. We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me... Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard? A little. Does it matter? After all, what�s the point of living if you can�t feel alive? Isn�t that right, Elektra? Isn�t that your motto? How did you survive? Shush. Not at that price. Time to surrender. I understand it�s normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end. If this little show is for my benefit, I�ll take you home right now. What the hell are you doing here? Two. Shaken not stirred. I have to go to work. No. You�ll be safe here. I have to go. ...you should rest. I think you�re one of the bravest people I�ve ever met. I can�t stay. It�s the only way out... You�re not going to. We�re alright. No. Always wanted to see the upper lines. I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King�s daughter. The killer doesn�t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn�t want to see you take over... It�s not the pin your father wore. It�s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company. Does this look familiar to you? How long has he been with you? Who is he? Is that why you want to finish the pipeline? Funerals aren�t exactly memorable. Yes. How appropriate. The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea. Where? This is too big for even you. Where is it? Where�s the sub going?! And the payoff on the tables? No. The truth! She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you. What do you know that she would kill you for? Now...where were we? You are out of your league. She�s working with Renard. She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn�t even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for? What�s your business with Elektra King? She�s no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant. But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline. How high up does this...arms dealing go? Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world. A nice little rat�s nest. You, of course. I need some information. Valentin Zukovsky.The inside man? Then Robert was right about a Russian connection. Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn�t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that. Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge. The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man. The doctor who saved him couldn�t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he�s a dead man. How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I�d do the same again. Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra�s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him. Claude Serrault. A.K.A... It�s a message. He wants us to know he�s back. I�m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it. You haven�t been given an assignment in this case. Who told you to look at Elektra�s files? And now it�s up for grabs, a goldrush. Far more oil than anyone thought. 007. What do you know of the Caspian Sea? Well, at least it turned out to have some purpose. I�ve scheduled a medical for you. Elektra? Running King Industries? I�ve known that girl all her life. I�m not sure she knows what she�s walking into. Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He�s a man of great integrity. Quite the opposite, in fact. Someone will come. Your father... Perhaps this isn�t the time... I�ll send someone out. Any word from him? Where it can do the most damage. The parcel�s in the post. Marvellous. Do we have the range of Renard�s plane? We�ve been pawns in someone�s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate. Cock-sure.I�d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years. The Maiden�s Tower. Mother of God. Istanbul. So. My way. No MI-6, no Interpol. Just you, me and my people. This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out! No! Get me out! A special job. A...a...a submarine. Alright, alright! Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her. Russian stuff. A rope! That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined! As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks. I thought you were the one in her business. Really Bond, couldn�t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears? Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic relationship. What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing? Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you. That too. Everyone does what they can to survive. Where did you get this? What? This is not possible. See? You�re upsetting my customers. What do you want? Have some of the rat�s nest caviar. From my own fishery. They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House. Bond, I�m a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family�s, now it�s mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble... BondJamesBond. What brings you here? C-class. In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit. No! Bond! To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
