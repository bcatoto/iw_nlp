attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great godfearing nation and he will never do an evil thinghe will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important just coax along flash over substance just a tiny bit and he will talk about all of us really being salesmen and hell get all the great women i know you care about him ive never seen you like this about anyone so please dont take it wrong when i tell you that i believe that tom while a very nice guy is the devil you cant end up with tom because it goes totally against everything

when you speak to him hes not at all nuts he seems like a leader very impressive selfcontrolthats whats so strange i think the pilot that shot down the libyan in 1981 is stationed right here maybe you could get him and maybe tom should say that our f14 is one of the hardest planes to fly theyre nicknamed tomcats watch what happened not because you have to can you believe it i just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups we can cut back at the end did you shoot their boots last time paul was sick they gave connie the weekend news instead of me i didnt sleep theyre giving me less and less air time they dont think im at all anchor material eleven and a half they didnt hire peter stiller from the times and he had a great audition tape wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turnon id give anything if that were true okay i feel like im slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think theyre slipping because their standards are so high okay lets do me because nobody invites a bad looking idiot to their bedroom he must have been greatlooking right wheres where i asked him about being scared you should work on your speech okay ill see you in the lobbies isici now listen arnold just said that hes been making

say anything to her im gon na go look at it again all this business of war do you get scared it depends on how big a news day it is how long has it been since youve been home we came from washington just a few questions no i think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser take care paul it takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the president of the news division oh come on tell us another norman rockwells enduring portrait of a homecoming the return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war tearful women proud men excited children but jd singer was right his homecoming was no big deal oh thats nice well need some new lines what is she shootingthe costefficient reporter its what he did im proud of him i understand ill go with you its been a while since you read the news ill have somebody work with you just on superficial performance things please prepare carefully this couldnt come at a better time i could do it this saturday everyone wants off for the correspondents dinner all i know is that theyve got to fire a large number of people and theyre not going by seniority theres a recklessness in the air they im no suggesting the worst will happenbut someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe the next time that happens down the road you should look into it aaron ive never seen them like this i think pauls nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to upper management thinks youre dull anyway i want you to think of this as we know each other well enough for me to care how i put something to you which could wipe you out so i will phrase things the way i think they should be phrased all right i dont know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you yeah oh i was just writing you a note what do you say we take a walk stop it i had the strangest thing happen

this one walk you home too yeah okay i still say fridas involved shes the last one to see two dudes alive poseur was missing a chunk of his neck and his eyes were open that always bugs me out do me a favor if some mutherfuckers about to blow me away remind me to close my fuckin eyes nah east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park sounds like you got a conflict of interest shes got a hidden pitbull maybe she hired someone to kill them this is more than fishy this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead i still dont get when you gave her back the pillowcase and he was missing an arm and you think im sick back in the 80s you didnt see the pictures they were from before she got famous she was hairy as hell her pits her bush waiting for dna tests he was hairier than madonna in penthouse i checked all the zoos no missing animals you think a pitbull hey there was a lot of blood fridas sheets checked out fine it was just her own blood from her you know nah man im just saying

all they have are some wolf hairs no one believes in werewolves sure cheating lying whats a little werewolf a few days a month we can move out to the country where you can feed off deer we can work this out other couples have worse problems i knew you wouldnt kill me im staying here with you tonight theres no getting rid of me cant you bite me and then ill be like you i have the silver bullets in case i need to protect myself does that make you feel better i dont think you would no matter what form you take i dont think youll hurt me im not afraid frida i love you if you dont like me just say so you dont have to make up some bullshit like youre a werewolf yes your pms frida i can deal with that you at least owe me the truth yes or no frida cant you just be honest with me what is there someone else frida you okay look i think i know what happened to mark i want to help im coming over no but i dont mind hairy are you okay no its a good thing i like it everything about you is great i like how you dont shave your legs women are so much sexier when theyre natural your breasts feel larger you know ive never seen your cat whats with the squirt guns you didnt say it is that how you feel is it that funny you cant mean that im sure your bark is worse than your bite thats it hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it she made us call her a different name shed say youre talking to betty now and wed leave the house for a few days speaking of mark weve tried to track him down and theres no sight of him vanished into thin air i got a hunch he fled the country did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times except mark of course yeah every guy you date winds up dead i thought we were starting something and then i know its unorthodox i mean with you being involved in the case and all what happened i need to talk to you about us frida i can i carry your box frida i was looking for you you changing jobs he was ripped to shreds also in his apartment still havent figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off never seen anything like it no no but mark a jealous boyfriend gone mad maybe he kills men you date you had a date with carlton frida can we come in we need to talk to you its important a man killed in central park you sure its my favorite shirt mind if i check was there anything in that washer no i was doing my laundry frida wait dont go we can just sleep i just want to wake up with you i mean we can still whatever maybe i should get a towel oh nothings wrong just well dont you have your period im a cop i notice everything that drawers ajar that pictures been moved about an inch the closet wasnt closed when i left oh just my wolf paraphernalia some people collect beanie babies i collect silver bullets silver bullets a collectors item these are very valuable they were melted down from a crucifix goodnight thanks for the walk maybe we could get a bite sometime me neither thats why i wear briefs so why did you and mark break up briefs yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line you know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case youre in an accident well this guy wasnt wearing any underwear sometimes its frustrating like this gregory jameson case we dont even know what killed him im putting together little details to see if were missing something the weird thing is ive had an odd morbid fascination with wolves ever since we lived in northern minnesota she went for a walk one night and they never found her body just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area ive had time to get over it she was killed by wolves they think no she died when i was twelve my mom used to get pms too i can forgive you a bestseller no really i love knowing what people read so what book did you buy okay well maybe some other time they continue walking together some decaf then that was stupid obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off you wan na get some coffee theres a lot of that going around being a cop has such a warm effect on people at least let me give you this back i washed it no no this is embarrassing i was returning your pillowcase and i saw you cross the street and i sort of started following you i just find you really intriguing i dont know why you busted me okay if you think of anything else please give us a call whens the last time you saw him hes been running money for the mafia why would you want to be a cop we can just take this pillowcase were just trying to figure out what happened yeah sorry uh gregorys roommate told us you were out with him last night what kind of animal did we get those dna tests back so theyre on some cycle the murders gregory then 28 days later carlton what makes her think that what the fuck are you following me for im not a suspect here what are you talking about okay lloyd first no way does frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds second why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys third shes the one in danger shes a woman in jeopardy and youre layin a murder rap on her fourth i look in her eyes and know shes no killer hard to tell looks like hes been cleaned up and hes decomposing as we speak this case gets weirder by the minute its like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes spencers the key here frida is in no way associated with him and her blood hasnt matched with any of the killings seems hes stolen money from them hes desperate and our only lead he means the last that we know of she wasnt the last one to see them alive whoever killed them was deal and if some mutherfuckers about to blow me away shoot him the park dude was missing an arm you take the cake lloyd come on shes not here lets check out her psycho ex shes not a suspect what is her motive theres nothing nothing connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys okay lloyd you tell me how she killed them we only live a few blocks apart he was found nearly ripped to shreds in central park what hairy women are kind of sexy women in their natural state madonnas in penthouse maybe what about all those hairs they found on his body she was never a suspect lloyd some animal must have done this i told you she was innocent i can tell shes not a killer you just dont like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation oh so you decide to be a cop seriously you dont have sex with a woman cause shes on the rag that dude was torn limb from limb no way a woman like that could have done it you never seen blood on a chicks sheets from her period he was found a few blocks away youre some catch lloyd man youre livin dangerously let me ask you somethin you always have to get women drunk before theyll sleep with youyes you can give me a hand here

starting to lose confidence i just work for vizzini to pay the bills theres not a lot of money in revenge i was eleven years old when i was strong enough i dedicated my life to the study of fencing so the next time we meet i will not fail i will go up to the sixfingered man and say hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man he was a great swordmaker my father and when the sixfingered man appeared and requested a special sword my father took the job he slaved a year before he was done well wait until youre ready you dont know any way youll trust me i hate waiting i could give you my word as a spaniard but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top i could do that in fact ive got some rope up here but i do not think that you will accept my help since i am only waiting around to kill you i do not suppose you could speed things up sorry slow going well its the only way i can be satisfied if i use my right tch over too quickly i want to duel him lefthanded you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means my god hes climbing hes climbing the rope and hes gaining on us look hes right on top of us i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using i dont swim 15 no reason its only i just happened to look behind us and something is there youre sure nobodys following us making sure nobodys following us as you wish faithfulness he talked of madam your enduring faithfulness now tell me truly when you found out he was gone did you get engaged to your prince that same hour or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead i asked him what was so important for him true love he replied and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness i can only assume he meant you you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are he died well that should please you no bribe attempts or blubbering he simply said please please i need to live it was the please that caught my memory 53 does it bother you to hear life is pain highness anyone who says differently is selling something i remember this farm boy of yours i think this would be what five years ago i cant afford to make exceptions once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft people begin to disobey you and then its nothing but work work work all the time hardly complimentary your highness why loose your venom on me with pride what can i do for you rest highness are not capable of love is what you mean you admit to me you do not love your fiance you think your dearest love will save you 50 and what is that worth the promise of a woman youre very funny highness catch your breath they were both poisoned i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder i am no one to be trifled with that is all you ever need know why should that make such a difference why is that do you think and a good thing too look are you just fiddling around with me or what frankly i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting you mean youll put down your rock and ill put down my sword and well try to kill each other like civilized people i believe you so what happens now i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself however since i cant have you following me either get used to disappointment no one of consequence i am not lefthanded either theres something i ought to tell you youre amazing and what is that then why are you smiling thank you ive worked hard to become so i thought it fitting considering the rocky terrain you seem a decent fellow i hate to die whether i am or not youve been more than fair 30 well i certainly hope you find him someday youve done nothing but study swordplay how old were you do you always begin conversations this way again thank you nothing comes to mind no good ive known too many spaniards thats very comforting but im afraid youll just have to wait that does put a damper on our relationship if youre in such a hurry you could lower a rope or a tree branch or find something useful to do 26 thank you look i dont mean to be rude but this is not as easy as it looks so id appreciate it if you wouldnt distract me you guessed wrong whats so funny then make your choice youre trying to trick me into giving away something it wont work youre just stalling now australia truly you have a dizzying intellect youve made your decision then7 what you do not smell is called iocane powder it is odorless tasteless dissolves instantly in liquid and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man inhale this but do not touch good then pour the wine really in that case i challenge you to a battle of wits yes youre that smart but if there can be no arrangement then we are at an impasse perhaps an arrangement can be reached let me explainfinish him finish him your way give her to me catch up with us quickly im waiting i do not accept excuses im just going to have to find myself a new giant thats all you were supposed to be this colossus you were this great legendary thing and yet he gains faster veer left left left no more rhymes now i mean it am i going mad or did the word think escape your lips you were not hired for your brains you hippopotamic land mass ive hired you to help me start a war thats a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition once the horse reaches the castle the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier his suspicions will be totally confirmed the country across the sea the sworn enemy of florin go its fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder oh have it your way you know what a hurry were in he didnt fall inconceivable inconceivable whoever he is hes too late see the cliffs of insanity 19 go in get after her what as i told you it would be absolutely totally and in all other ways inconceivable no one in guilder knows what weve done and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast out of curiosity why do you ask stop doing that we can all relax its almost over that would be inconceivable you only think i guessed wrong thats whats so funny i switched glasses when your back was turned you fool ill tell you in a minute first lets drink me from my glass and you from yours i will and i choose it has worked youve given everything away i know where the poison is youd like to think that wouldnt you youve beaten my giant which means youre exceptionally strong so you could have put the poison in your own goblet trusting on your strength to save you so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you but youve also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied and in studying you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me yes australia and you must have suspected i would have known the powders origin so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me 46 wait till i get going where was i not remotely because iocane comes from australia as everyone knows and australia is entirely peopled with criminals and criminals are used to having people not trust them as you are not trusted by me so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you now a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given im not a great fool so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you but you must have known i was not a great fool you would have counted on it so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me hmm i smell nothing i accept for the princess morons let me put it this way have you ever heard of plato aristotle socrates im afraid so i cant compete with you physically and youre no match for my brains there will be no arrangement and youre killing her theres nothing to explain youre trying to kidnap what ive rightfully stolen 43you dont believe me so its to be torture then why bother curing me then im here till i die then youre not married if you didnt say it you didnt do it wouldnt you agree your highness did you say i do it never happened 117 it never happened what hideous sin have you committed lately gently gently now was that so terrible 64 rodents of unusual size i dont think they exist i mean what are the three terrors of the fire swamp one the flame spurts no problem theres a popping sound preceding each we can avoid that two the lightning sand but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like so in the future we can avoid that too no no we have already succeeded finally roberts decided something he said all right westley ive never had a valet you can try it for tonight ill most likely kill you in the morning three years he said that good night westley good work sleep well ill most likely kill you in the morning it was a fine time for me i was learning to fence to fight anything anyone would teach me and roberts and i eventually became friends and then it happened i myself am often surprised at lifes little quirks 59 this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ship revenge is anchored at the far end and i as you know am roberts singed a bit were you nonsense youre only saying that because no one ever has 57 there will never be a need death can not stop true love all it can do is delay it for a while i told you i would always come for you why didnt you wait for me can you move at all this is true love you think this happens every day hear this now i will come for you of course you will as you wish as you wish wrong your ears you keep and ill tell you why i wasnt finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye followed by your right ill explain and ill use small words so that youll be sure to understand you warthogfaced buffoon no to the pain death first it will not happen ah but how will you capture us we know the secrets of the fire swamp we can live there quite happily for some time so whenever you feel like dying feel free to visit you mean you wish to surrender to me very well i accept have you ever considered piracy youd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts in that case i thought he was with you light him not yet true but thats hardly common knowledge is it thank you now there may be problems once were inside well why didnt you list that among our assets in the first place what i wouldnt give for a holocaust cloak and our assets that doesnt leave much time for dilly dallying who

all of supermans powers if ive planned it right quiet youll make him selfconscious that hair contains a sample of supermans genetic material the building blocks of his body with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes i will create a being with all his powers but with absolute allegiance to me i look at you lenny and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their
