sunday hats mmhmm pff they hardly even noticed you every time i put my head up to hit that gatling they try to shoot it off everything but the boring parts yeah jimmy i think he was just a real interestin fella to have around cant argue that saved a lot of folk from the railroad that he was allow a man his version of the past when you get to be my age youve got enough painful memories youre

getting married zee when my name makes them cry in their sleep when ive brought them to ashes laws dont touch men like thaddeus rains only justice does me neither frank and me have to go away for a while ive been planning on kissin you for a very long time yep little ones ahem from this doctrine no ah from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still like shiny sparkling rocks honestly youd do if only you had the buck teeth smart funny bossy always makes me think shes two steps ahead of me and big buck teeth not if i find the right girl mostly it would be an all right life for a bachelor arr hand over your jewels missy i was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate i used to come to this tree when i was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when i got older unfair you are completely unfair i wasnt the only one risking my neck that day what what you do to me is unfair the teasing i mean no i mean of course not no ive been on my back two weeks im sick of it nuhhuh mmmm if theres anything we can do for you dr mimms we want to help but you got big zerelda little zee mimms fair enough thanks that was for my ma now this is for everybody else ahh youll miss me im not hanged yet should have just killed thaddeus rains and been done with it i figured no that one was close a couple fellas quit after that one almost got me in billings i saw you there shooting at me the cows had a brand from a farm just five miles out of town you had all those cattle there so id think the extra men were in town from the cattle drive last february you almost ended my career before it began did you order our houses burned down so ill get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by thaddeus rains but i like the presidential suite right here in church thank you i could have lied i suppose but i want this marriage to be legal i just want you to know im trying to start a new life here im depending on your you dont think godll mind do you youre gon na tell her when youre resting up in bed with her jimmy this time well make an exception what about that rock island bastard you do that i swear i think so you been with a girl ever jim you been with a girl yet i guess so yeah hey are you drinking whisky youre too young to be drinking whisky no and the same age web was no and youre too youngfine ill just wait here oh why didnt you just say so then why cant i go in there i know it aint no durned bank holidaytheres only four of them how can that be they had to be dealt with relax alan the army has this all in hand and mr thaddeus rains will be very pleased with this news nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate im doing you folks a favor how did you know i remember you oh that ill let jenkins explain what sir sir the final route for the railroad is complete we should go burn that school to the ground sir your men knew the risks we did to be precise they didnt blow up the tracks thirtyfive thousand sir coins and currency and the delay from the miles of destroyed track they exchanged fire with the pinkerton guards killing several of them then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile i see ill get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight a further impediment is that the army garrison has been ordered to move on from liberty we will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers yes sir unfortunately not sir a gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers the redoubtable mr alan pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident two weeks ago we managed to arrange to have the army hang one of the local farmers i can completely understand your distress sir really mr thaddeus rains sir it is a pleasure to have you join us in the fieldid just as soon kill you jesse james but chasing you takes up too much of my time the railroad has no business in tennessee therefore i have no interest in the state of tennessee hes too important james theyll set the army on you you and your wife no ill hang you but i may miss you just a bit you cocky little bastard thats what i would have done was it worth it oh thats nice to know were going to hang you you know i went myself to oversee the operation didnt help much damn yes mmm how did you spot the ambush in torrell pity not that day i am guilty of many things but that was mr thaddeus rains and parker that day thats the idea oh its a similar room but the hotel is in washington dc youre not going to get a fair trial down here in front of a jury of jesse james sympathizers were moving you tomorrow move you fools they donate money to farmers to churches rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of maddox so much money they were able to build a school by burning down their homes my professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time its not my job to relax ive put men facing out both ways down main street so nobody can ride in shooting ive got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case well this land is about to be condemned vengeance why their intense hatred of you of course no need i have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank there are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed every three months the james gang circles back to the vicinity of liberty missouri they always pull a job right before they return probably to have extra money to give family and friends no its going to be a long spring no you demand results they are not the same thing and if you want results you will let me do my job as i see fit unless of course you want this fool to saddle up and take another run at it yes thats the way to win the locals back to our side and there are some towns in missouri where james and his men can walk openly as heroes first of all you shut up now youve given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover every time the james gang strikes we shift a hundred detectives to that area but theres just too much open land too many riverbeds to ride caves to hide in this gang operates across four states often riding a hundred miles between jobs all of the james gangs encounters have been with local law enforcement who quite frankly are no match for this groups cunning its going to be a long winter hardly farmers ive done some checking all these were in the war these men know sabotage tactics and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them they are disciplined welltrained and have a charismatic leader if i were to design the perfect outlaw band this gang is what i would create its early in the game yet mr rains jesse james and i are just learning how each other moves feeling out each others patterns oh thats the best part it is a nice piece of writing im afraid our adversaries dont agree would a jury around here convict their own i think not were beginning an interesting game here mr rains oh no i would have done that but i would have made sure i killed them too not to mention my men who lost their livesnot such a menace now is he pinkerton this is him that what is that parker i look forward to seeing it with my money what is going on here man then who did ill kill them for blowing up my railway how much did they get from the safe ill teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress you see the army leaving and you see the loss of a tool i see a power void to be filled as we have the most power we may move with impunity just perfect leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers good parker tell me whats going on so i can return as quickly as possible to boston and my whores and cigars not necessarily in that order no it is not my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you can not seem to evict a few simple farmers from their pathetic little mudholes so that i may build the greatest railroad that this country has ever seen and it is my pleasure to be here what the hell is that sound what is that can you put men at all four in english pinkerton so hes won cant you tell me anything i demand action i cant believe this pinkerton its been eight months i see robberies i see hold ups but i do not see men on the end of nooses so you cant tell me anything im losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers the gang made off with thirtyfive thousand dollars and also destroyed the thaxton switch construction meaning that for a few months honest farmers will be able to sleep without fearing the railroad is coming to steal their land who wrote this ill see him hanged every tuesday for a month a rock island and pacific railroad depot was robbed two nights ago just outside st louis missouri the brave and daring jamesyounger gang was heavily outnumbered by pinkerton detectives but the city lawmen were no match for the guns of the west this is no game i want them arrested and hanged you wouldnt have done that look at this pinkerton they got the payroll and this damage will set construction back two months at leasti do know you focus on the big problem but somewhere down the chain something breaks down something gets destroyed at first its upsetting you feel youve lost control i hope you know what you mean to me not just because of what youre doing because of who you are you see whats hanging on the wall oh thats right youre clueless you couldve handwritten it dear lisa ive enjoyed working with you id be lying if i didnt say i find you attractive but in my heart i know that alice you left my party to send email sorry about the late notice dont be so hard on yourself with a brain like yours you could connive with the best of em i bet worse what would you tell the kids at your new school you had to come up with a good story right why did you move around so much when you were a kid have a look you look a little tired the answers not in the box its in the band been thinking about the push mechanism in the handler and it came over me its in the wrong place 34000 but theyre real short lines just came out that way youve been coming in early i meant did you find other stuff to did you had you talked to him much lately i heard what happened it scales dont you think the purpose of this company isnt to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath but the software business is binary youre a zero or a one being obsessive isnt a crime its a character trait everything i do is under scrutiny the questions they ask trying to make anything strategic look sordid im confused doesnt everybody in business try to get ahead whatre you implying right right milo whats up youre making me young again take a look at this slightly different approach too fast at least four companiesre on the verge of workable convergence systems milo they hows it going dont spend too much time searching you ever vetted somebodys old code before its a different skill stay close to the surface the besthidden secrets are in plain sight you know the best place to hide a leaf right in a tree thats what i told her my wife somebody said im just another philistine with reproductions think i should buy some originals okay im gary yeah i wan na feel like i did when i wrote that but im 42 thats 100 in cyberyears i look at you and see the things that got me here but somehow got away when you get to a certain age you start wondering about your legacy i doubt you even remember outpost 10 youd have to start practically from scratch but this is all youd be working on no marketing meetings no product seminars we cant waste the time half the valleys working on convergence sore media conglomerates cable companies phone companies cant finish second milo there is no second now what would you like to ask me the content filer has tbe written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms really omniplatforms including whatever new hardware emerges among other things we know convergence is the real superhighway all the pcs tvs phones etc linked together why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky ive only shown this to three other people i bought 200 weve launched 12 so far i keep the coordinates in this room its left over from sdi reagans star wars technology they orbit 426 miles up theres a rumor going around maybe youve heard it would you like a coke or something milo gary boyd im hoping you and your friend can come up here weve made some amazing strides in digital convergence id love to show them to you just do it knows im altering the coordinates lets jump to 12 wait he knows lets go okay 2 just do what im asking help me change the skywire settings add five degrees to each satellite coordinate nothing does still i want him to like me whatd the girl say maybe we should all get on it this is good who did itright wait a toast wan na savor this great dont we have any chopsticks what you look beautiful great no no i sent an email to somebody just now to tell her how i feel about you you know im clueless without you you know i i went to see the skywire model in garys office you know just to hold it again i know you think im too attached to him but still i am close to gary and youre the most meaningful person in my life im going back to the comix place why should i be killing myself its for the museum he knows youre a painter if anybody should be invited why doesnt he ask us to his party hes never even met you look at this okay yeah i did something naughty theres this amazing comix store in seattle to tell you the truth i did it once or twice at stanford guess i cant keep anything from you different if id stayed down there maybe this wouldntve happened after i broke into 21 which was insane thank god they didnt catch me i just drove around trying to figure out what possessed me you know what ive been putting my own guilt on gary the justice department guy who came to the apartment when remember lyle barton its what they said it is an unfinished broadcast studio you were right i just drove to seattle and back nothing so you believe me i know how to get in there but youve got ta help me they stop the construction work at six or seven the parking lots mostly clear by two or three in the morning even the early geeks dont get there before five i cant just walk away its the only one with dishes on the roof the studios a front thats why they keep postponing its opening got ta get in there how should i know solving a problem i guess or needing to control everything i dont know ive got ta get in there you think i dont know that go where you cant get away from people like this it isnt a broadcast studio its a surveillance post or something thats why they have the dishes on top nobody does work like this online its in your pc or in a mainframe selfcontained theyd have to be like watching people physically oh jesus i dont know i just know it was teddys code all these ideas flying in from everywhere you know how he says any kid working in his garage can put us out of business its like they know what every kids doing i dont know what im saying maybe maybe they hired those guys whatre you what what youre right its a working relationship dont know what i was expecting isnt that extreme i know i know thats what im asking myself does he have some genius stowed away why not let him write skywire not saying it makes sense its the way he said it just the way my dad did when he was caught in a lie thats how you knew you were onto something ugly he gave me some new codefixes this morning i said did you really do this just today cause i was impressed he said whatre you implying to our new life whats wrong you know hes never been anybodys counselor before that took some fun out of whens brian coming for the tv you saved my life in alot of ways cmon i wouldnt have a destiny without you my destiny would be dying at 20 from eating i forgot thats why you have to help me decide but if my dadd leveled with me like that even once the weird thing is my fantasy he could somehow be like the old gary its his fantasy too when i was a kid and he was moving us all over the place i spent all my time writing stuff on outpost 10 i thought gary boyd was the greatest if hes really a bully he wont cop to it anyway a lot of what larry says is true they just clone stuff or reverse engineer it and everybody gets stuck with their inferior version cause they i think i kind of lost it i was just so thrilled to be talking to the richest most powerful didnt know i even cared about that stuff yes sir just didnt know who else to talk to i just wan na help bring these guys to justice theyre neonazis it was racially motivated hes chinese he was and i know sometimes the fbi gets involved with that dont they my friend my best friend teddy was killed in silicon valley i am i am sir yeah hi thank you for seeing me yes sir i need to talk to you mr barton do you remember me its just i kind of feel the need to do something with my ability create something right whats that mean again you shouldve called a few times to bug me about your job prospects hes working backwards too lets do number five is it your dish gim me the coordinates wan na be a part of history great great we need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door whatd they ever do for you no but you can write your own ticket in the valley after this were gon na bring down outpost brian you wan na be a big deal dont you thats your dream in life this is the biggest beta demo in like the history of software youd be my partner forgot to introduce you i have a girlfriend sure ill see what i can do youre living here whos that he just likes to write code hes bummed theres so much secrecy and competition everybody trying to own everything hes pretty tight with his family oh hi im pretty close but when i wrote the last contact switches it wiped out a piece of the content filer you know what its like writing software i do know gary i feel the same way i thought i was coming here for a job but its meant a lot more gary i im not much good at handwriting or parties i couldnt do it at work cause of security or at home for obvious reasons thats great thanks cause he was a liar and i hated him get your head out of that machine wise up to the real world the more he mocked me the deeper i went cause if being savvy meant being like him guess thats why im kind of clueless even now didnt cultivate my conniving side not sure i even have one no i just went deeper into the machine preferred being the geek to having to explain lying wouldve been worse my dad was a compulsive gambler only he didnt think he was that applied to guys who didnt have a system losers who played games of chance he could read people so chance had nothing to do with it no matter how deep a hole he dug himself hed give you the whole speech and youd better not point out the obvious his creditors would catch up to him loan sharks or whatever hed wake us in the middle of the night off wed go again sure im okay its going well gary hi the wrong place wow you must have 20000 lines of code there it helps alice said it would help to focus on something dont know what id do without her oh yeah talk about work never just once guess i was worried we didnt have anything to talk about since work was offlimits non disclosure were the flags for teddy definitely im sure nothing you really wrote this just today well you sent for me you did this overnight its okay really maybe im going too fast could work with a new switch there may be a few more things hidden thats insane youre ahead of your time do i no just waiting for my counselor to come by and introduce himself i do it needs a more objectoriented language this doesnt scale does it skywire low enough to relay internet traffic you know a lot about art i guess oh no thanks cool you would wow when would we come think he hung up hello cool got out of my other commitment well come up with the next big thing those really weird short lines its only meaningful when youve got 40000 lines of code to back it up just thought his work should go on i know you lost all his work maybe i could come down here and you do all the companies know the faculties tell em at the target schools wait a second he knows i know hes been altering the coordinates since we logged on hes a step ahead lets jump to 12 he knows lets try 2 bring it to the other location they know i had no choice get out of the house now do you have a laptop meet me at the other location at this point the worst thing i could do is anything out of the ordinary she called to apologize i said i was pulling an allnighter she said then come home just to say hi which i always do when we fight its suspicious if i dont he suspects i know something i think he was sort of explaining himself to me in case i do we have to go in tonight im two hours from a beta version but ive got ta go home for an hour thats lame isnt it perfect how am i gon na get away from the party long enough to oh hardly anybody does thats the beauty part no cameras the doj doesnt bother with it its accessed by a tunnel they boast about you know the best place to hide a leaf they know i broke in alice helped me shrots not one of them hes blundering into this on his own thank god great i knocked off the aglet as soon as i get a passable version of skywire were there i felt guilty cause i owed so much to alice but even then i was starting to wonder is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you if you have a lucrative skill its all anybody wants from you you grow older but you dont grow up you turn into into a beautiful geek whatre the chances i told teddy about you think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are why were you snooping in my office why were you so careless i dont know oh man id have to get into garys house to get the satellite positions gary knows im close on skywire we have to do this fast youd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop maybe some audio too to tie it all in to gary how long would that take you its how online services push logos they wan na sell you you dont ask for em they just appear have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house and then the quality of the broadcast wouldnt exactly be digital thats 12 months away we cant just assume theyre standing by to receive skywire 12 months from launch id have to write in an aglet what timewarner has a 40 per cent stake in garys settop device that also takes out cnn ge joins outpost in new venture which means nbc is out disney joins outpost abc is out outpost and newscorp in new deal fox is out any of these places could have a mole or all of em its like a a continuous loop we can go to some alternative press place that 1000 people read get them and us killed but anything big enough for this is a parent of or a subsidiary to something garys got a finger in say theres just one mole working there like barton at the doj how do we know hes not the guy weve contacted or she or the guy she works for yeah they dig stuff like this cbs news has partnered with outpost information systems in a cable news network due to launch fall of 2001 hes buying up pretty much everything cable companies baby bells picture libraries museum rights film archives getting ready for skywire certainly not at my happy home right but garys tiedin to a lot of media conglomerates have to be careful who we pick do we post it on the net theres always a logical answer you just have to define the question theyve got this guy in the doj maybe others we tell the wrong person its over no no never hmm theyre already watching you if they had to theyd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout hed wake up not even remembering his act of revenge theyd frame him i know why youre so secretive why you wont let anybody near you i know what he did to you you know there is no second place and whats the risk the killingsre undetectable theyre handtailored they make sense i mean theyre in the information business they have scenarios for all of us too in case we find out too much its easy to know who the smart geeks are the schools tell em they upload medical files school records pharmacy files theyd be happy just to steal code forever but when a program gets close to fruition like teddy he was almost there you thought about it too youve been suspicious for a while but its not happening in there its happening in the day care i snuck into 21 she saved my life so when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers was that then or now whys that youre compulsive right right but does he ever just like hand you code there is no second place plus every time i get jammedup gary has an inspiration is it like that with your counselor no please cool show me whatve you got there did i say something didnt mean to pry i just have this theory some of us who got to good at this we were escaping something me too were you an army brat or something were you im getting a teachers pet rep you know mine lisa i didnt plan this what does that mean what dyou mean no i keep thinking itll go away but theres this connection shes been hacking since she was little she had to move around a lot plus i see her every day were working on the same program shes beautiful i dont know i met this girl jesus teddy what outpost made me sign 1000 guess well find out what else we have to talk about life stuff wanted to say goodbye to him is that how larry feels you got my email garys not into fiber optics hes betting everything on the satellites whatre they building ive got a girlfriend remember shes a programmer his snapples were in alphabetical order so how far are we from the campusi thought you could give us the tour this morning sort of be our indian guide you can see why its sensitive to customers approaching the bank from the rear this is sensitive your car lovely car doesnt necessarily give the right impressionright hello uh yes right ch leave her alone just leave her alone oh jesus of course i cant oh jesus ive got eight hundred pounds oh jesus ill fuckin give it to him well go down there ill give him money tell him to put the tell him to put

him please theres no oh you dont have to say anything get out get out you dont understand me it wasnt what i wanted i got what i paid for what i think its my safest bet dont you well its just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman or alone for that matter makes me want to die i dont like sex i dont think ill be having sex ever again some what does that mean sometimes which so what do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine youre with him or what listen i didnt go rooting around in your private stuff so what then you just detach sex from everything and that would be morals that would be ones own moral sense of decency and its wrong okay lets okay okay you have had sex with people you dont like havent you for money to make money so whats it like having to fuck men you hate no shut up im not listening i dont want to talk about it yeah i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too excuse me not the kids type then is he not that broody you must be pretty miffed of course of course of course he does of course thank you thanks oh jesus so uh fine absolutely must be disappointing though must come as a hell of a shock fine

what well nadia it its all the same to you id like to give it a bash in every sense if at all possible i do i want to very badly in the world you must think im the biggest pillock in the world well as it turns out i did even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me im going to drink my coffee then were going to the police station where there will be lawyers loss of job house humiliation gutter press and probably prison thats a relief its nice to know im a regular guy i dont want to know unless unless this is part of the routine you get tied up stick around distract me they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee i think that about covers it i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though thats got to hurt i imagine thats got to smart a bit i mean strictly in my observers capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously oh i dont know in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals this took a lot of understanding and sympathy to try to work out solutions to their problems but you see im not in that line of work anymore nowadays im a bank robber of course they go yes yes whats wrong yes i know happy birthday happy birthday syevodnya i dont understand sorry uh are you a giraffe do you follow or should i speak slower good or

quite good actually some bits i really liked i paid for those guitar cases when we went to the hard rock cafe who paid when we went to see cats who paid ive been buying you stuff all week ive been buying him stuff all week no i dont what for fifty thousand almost exactly im so sorry he is sure you can do this of course you can not you dont understand he wants all the money that is in your bank

nadia is a prostitute im sorry he says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers john he is a soldier a trained killer we must do what he says john i have brought you trouble maybe i should have come alone i understand im so sorry to be indoors on such a day its crime how is bank its very strange how many people are truly themselves with their love it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers there are no marches against heartache no ministries against loneliness no concerts against disappointment we look away and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us the one thing we all share but dont say look john i will show you something do you believe in love you are not ashamed of it its no surprise to want to love he says why did you send to russia for a wife no it is too judgmental oh nothing binoculars he had these binoculars he has kept from the war i have these uh she explains to you when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses like i dont know the word like for watching uh for watching the birds i saw you waiting there by the gate she says she has a secret to tell classic thank god she says yes she says hello to you go for it john youre asking for my documents plans are for the architects politicians and so forth i asked her if you were happy to see us i find it hard to tell with you so i come to england with other actors to make shows i meet this freak from novgorod i tell him of you and chicken and the birthday here we are right so i can say he smokes me so i am actor he is actor although he is an actor stroke musician i just noodle along im not so good he makes me look like a retard he smokes me i dont mean he smokes me we better watch him hes crazy of course not alexei hes

is my little cousin except shes not but we say cousin this is for you good oh we are russian he says he feels safe here what sorry youve lost me you must find some glasses small for the toast and some plates hows that we cant drink our piss can wenot if you chose to stay within gods channel if you could see your path or channel growing out of your stomach you could see into the future and thats a form of time travel right if god controls time then all time is predecided then every living thing travels along a set path could these wormholes appear in nature like a spear that comes out of your stomach like a spear well the thing is nobody remembers their infancy and anyone who says they do is lying we think that this would help develop memory earlier in life like a delorean so thats it and be able to find one of these wormholes so in order to travel back in time youd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light i know that this is gon na sound kinda weird but do you know anything about time travel dr monnitoff the last unicorn by samantha darko what happens if you tell mom and dad about this samantha when you fall asleep tonight im gon na fart in your face not until like eighth grade our saviour dea ex machina well if youre innocent then you have nothing to worry about i didnt say shit how much longer is this gon na last why do they call you frank what happened to your eye take it off i want to see you yeah tell me why youre wearing that stupid bunny suit you have to do something for me first where did you come from who is we why did you make me flood the school how can you do that go home go home and tell your parents that everything is going to be just fine a hundred and one i think every day she does the same thing but theres never any mail i dont wan na talk about it we went to a hotel yeah no frank time is running out we have to go see grandma death we have to talk to her come with me theres something you have to

you want to skip fourth period and go to the ridge the whole movie lets go yeah so the idea is that you buy these glasses for your infant and they wear them at night when they sleep so we call them imgs i know shes here she never leaves the house she wrote it there are chapters in this book that describe the stuff ive been seeing it cant just be a coincidence will you come see her with me the old crazy woman who lives off old gun road ive been seeing stuff a lot of really messedup stuff do you know who grandma death is they suspended me for two days were moving through time i always wanted it to be at a time when when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be thats alright i understand well you know weve been going together for a week and a half with like images why not just buy your baby a night light i dont want to talk about it so what happened to your neck why yeah no every time i wake up somewhere different sometimes my bike is laying there next to me like once when i woke up on the edge of this cliff up on carpathian ridge its like this big force thats in your brain but sometimes it grows bigger and it spread down into your arms and legs and it just sends you someplace no i just wake up and i look around try to figure out where i am how i got there where are you going no i mean will you go with me thats like what they call it here going together will you go with me im sorry we never would have had this conversation its a good thing the school was flooded today the best thing about soap is that its the only thing on earth that can never get dirty no matter what crap you throw on it it always rubs off and there it is again perfect dont knock soap without it disease would spread rapidly if we ran out you and i would never live to see the year 2000 i mean the whole sanitation thing joseph lister 1895 before antiseptics there was no sanitation especially in medicine thats easy antiseptics what makes you think im not im sorry i was in jail once i accidentally burned down this house it was abandoned i got held back in school again cant drive until im eighteen i think when i grow up i want to be a painter or maybe a writer or maybe both then ill write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book you know change things wow did he go to jail oh i have those too what kind of problems does your dad have so you just moved here im not but you should check your backpack cause those guys like to steal shit sure schools cancelled hey people arent that simple well yeah ok but youre not listening to me there are other things that need to be taken into account here like the whole spectrum of human emotion youre just lumping everything into these two categories and like denying everything else well life isnt that simple so what if ling ling kept the cash and returned the wallet that has nothing to do with either fear or love i just dont get this everything cant be lumped into two categories thats too simple im sorry ms farmer i just dont get this how does it feel to have a wacko for a son do you get to meet ed fine you know dr thurman isnt so bad a lady i can tell her anything grandma death then why dont you start taking the goddamn pills i stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade mom get out of my room oh please tell me elizabeth how exactly does one suck a fuck youre such a fuckass will you still be working at yarn barn cause thats a great place to raise children i know dad a lot of people teachers younger kids its like theyre afraid of me for some reason but thats ok because i know i deserve it i guess she just lost faith in the world you know roberta sparrow we almost hit her with the car the other day grandma death so were not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows where it came from do they know yet it was great we had peanutbutter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime and then during showand tell my stuffed walrus was a big hit i think i already have but now she wont even talk to me cellar door whats cellar door what do i tell the rest of the class when they ask about you thats bullshit youre a good teacher where are you going ms pomeroy whats going on of course a rabbit is not like us it has no history books it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret i like bunnies and all theyre cute and theyre horny and if youre cute and horny then youre probably happy that you dont know who you are or why youre even alive but the only thing ive known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die why should i mourn for a rabbit like it was a human why should we care a sixfoottall bunny rabbit well they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds when they flood the house that like destruction is a form of creation so the fact that they burn the money is ironic they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart they want to change things goodbye dr thurman thank you its too late ive already ruined my life hes right there he can read my mind and hell show me the way out of this the sky is going to open up and then he will reveal himself to me i can see him right now frank is going to kill soon time is almost up it would have to be gods portal they will lead me to it then i will go back in time and i wont feel regret anymore grandma death will teach me how soon i have the power to build a time machine i think so i think thats one of the clues its a clue that tells us to keep going because im so horny i think now that he might i have to obey him because he saved my life he controls me and i have to obey him or ill be left all alone and ill never figure out what all of this means yes i flooded my school and i burned down that perverts house i think i only have a few days left before they catch me that i did it again regret hungry hungry hippos they didnt buy me what i wanted for christmas that year yes i went to jail people get hurt i dont want to hurt anyone people get hurt i i was playing with fire yes yeah you know fucking i mean gretchen she wont even let me kiss her she says because its our first kiss shes like waiting for this big moment or something i just dont get it i just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff whoa thats ok dr thurman its nothing to be embarrassed about i have sexual fantasies all the time too you know every week i come in here and i tell you stuff and its all embarrassing i tell you stuff that i dont tell anyone else and you know what its your turn dr thurman im not saying anything else until you tell me something embarrassing about yourself yeah but if i told her about the other stuff about frank nothing it was just like she described them in her book like they were alive the way that they looked moved smelled they were like workers assigned to each one of us i followed my spear and i found something id like to believe that im not but ive just never seen any proof so i just choose not to bother with it its like i could spend my whole life thinking about it debating it in my head weighing the pros and cons and in the end i still wouldnt have any proof so i dont even debate it any more because its absurd i dont want to be alone so does that make me like an atheist no she died when i was eight we couldnt find her for days she went and crawled underneath our back porch it reminded me of my dog callie i think that frank wants me to go to this woman she wrote a book about time travel frank asked me if i believed in time travel that cant just be a random coincidence my dad almost hit her with the car the other day and she said the creepiest thing she said that every living creature on this earth dies alone i dont know gretchen has a theory that frank is a sign i told her i thought it was ridiculous i dont think so its like a tv station and theyre tuned into mine and no one elses four times so far no i dont think about fucking my family thats sick i just turn the volume down and think about fucking alyssa milano i think about whos the boss i think about fucking a lot during school i think about girls a lot yes gretchen were going together now i met a girl yes no thats stupid into the future then he said that the world was coming to an end he said to follow him a jet engine fell on my house landed on my bed while i was talking to frank on the golf course dont you watch the news i think he saved my life his name is frank so i met a new friend ive been taking it i just like to make her feel guilty for all of this you know abuse her psychologically everything is going to be just fine mom and dad wont be back until sunday night its halloween carnival we should throw a party we could totally get away with it congratulations her name is gretchen i was just being honest well dont worry im taking my medication because you tell mom everything youre not gon na tell mom are you yeah guess who wrote it its called the philosophy of time travel whoa elizabeth a little hostile there maybe you should be the one in therapy then mom and dad can pay someone two hundred dollars an hour to listen to all of your thoughts so we wont have to well i think youre the fucking antichrist well jim i think youre full of shit gerald how much are they paying you to be heregoodbye donald donald an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a god you are an agnostic an agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of god but does not deny the possibility that god exists your medication theyre placebos just pills made out of water you will survive this donald i promise you that you will survive you must let me help you and when i clap my hands together you will wake up if the sky were to suddenly open up there would be no law there would be no rule there would only be you and your memories the choices youve made and the people youve touched the life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged by which you must judge yourself because when this world ends there will only be you and him and no one else where is he donald who is he going to kill what is going to happen when will this happen then how is time travel possible how is that possible where are we going donald where are we going god exists because youre horny why if god exists why did you do these things donnie did frank tell you to commit these crimes youve done it again what else makes you feel regret how did you feel being denied those hungry hungry hippos what did you want for christmas that year do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead but you were punished but it was an accident the house was under construction is it frank who wants you to destroy the world to set the world on fire so your parents why did you disappoint them and when i clap my hands together twice you will wake up do you understand have you ever made love donald the good stuff i know are you embarrassed by these things that you see have you told gretchen about the spears what did you find and they grow out of our stomachs no that makes you keep searching do you feel alone right now is callie still around how does that make you feel a sign from whom who is they is frank part of some larger group can anyone else see him how many times have you seen frank donnie i want to hear about your friend frank what about your family donnie who is the boss what else do you think about during school i asked you about school how are things going at school do you think a lot about girls what is her name so tell me about your day donald and when i clap my hands twice you will wake up do you understand do you believe that the world is coming to an end follow him where frank instructed you to get out of bed just before this happened i dont own a television how so frank would you like to talk about this friend all of this certainly isnt your mothers fault donald your mother said that youve been skipping cycles of your medication but let me remind you that this treatment is experimental i would like to put him through more hypnotherapy and increase his medication he has described lengthy conversations physical encounters with what i believe to be a manifestation of his subconscious mind donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination frank the giant bunny rabbit has your son ever told you about frank what i think is going on with your sonbut i cant i just buzzed him in actually i was just checking to see if you were here your friend seymour is on his way up she understands what youre going through and she really wants to help you she says that job at computer station is still available if you want it yeah i heard about that about what pumpkin are you in there well as you know maxine and i have been seeing a lot of each other and we decided it might be a good idea for all of us if she came back here to live at the end of the summer just so we can all get to know each other and to make sure this is what we want ive got some important news to tell you but it can wait till later if youre not feeling pumpkin whats wrong well maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at computer station normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience but she thinks she can convince them are you still looking for a job i have some good news for you pumpkin i made spaghetti do you want some yup maxine give up someone from the past guess did i tell you who i ran into at the bagel place well i think its good to keep all your options open you can always enroll for the winter quarter

way find some other poor sucker to abuseenid and i were just friends you know we feel comfortable around each other she really likes my old records and ii honestly never intended for this to happen its just that i feel like its maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out i uh i feel that i need to uh theres something i feel i have to say i uh ive never said this to anyone before believe me ive stayed in horrible relationships for years just so i wouldnt have to do this but i uh oh please dont let me interrupt finish your phone call dana hi uh dana this is enid uh no i missed that one

really mean all that about moving in with me ii never expected anything like this to happen i will if you want to do you really want us to drive away somewhere iii what do you want i dunno i so where would we go i dont think im in any condition to drive sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems i guess i probably used to when i was your age what yeah well i like you too what about joe yeah sure of course i mean of course i why wouldnt i want to go out with you youre a beautiful young girl i cant imagine you would ever have had any interest in me except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity i hate sports im just being realistic if you expect the worst youre never disappointed god shes going to kill me this bottle is halfempty dana bought it when we went antique shopping she said it didnt go with her stuff so she gave it to me she thought it fit in better with my old time thingamajigs i could never move ive got too much stuff thats danas im supposed to be saving it for our twomonth anniversary you better not uh i think theres some root beer whats the matter uh sure come in whats up what are you doing here what do you mean i dont know im sorry but danas a very jealous person i just dont want to screw that up right now im sure shell dump me soon and we can go back to being friends in what way do you mean no of course not i i dont think so just someone so young no no not exactly she just doesnt understand how i would know somebody like you no of course i do its just that right now i need to well you know what do i know about clothes ive never been the most fashionable guy its nice to have someone do all the work for me oh uh they were a present from dana its just that well you know dana just got out of a really bad relationship and i dont want to give her the wrong idea you know i i wish i could enid but i really cant right now i its just that i i better not i i dont know i dont really think i should so is he your boyfriend now iim sorry uh so uh how no no its just that i should get going in a few minutes and we really should get together sometime soon iill definitely call you this week sort of she doesnt dislike any of that stuff shes trying anyway actually were supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon oh pretty well surprisingly you know i know im sorry iive been really busy really yaaa jesus enid ill talk to you later bye yeah so i better go its not really the best time to talk actually its kind of still happening shes over here right now i think everythings going pretty well oh hi uh hello how can you be so sure uh yeah a long time ago she called before once its just somebody trying to humiliate me its just somebodys idea of a joke let the machine get it i have no desire to talk to anyone who would be calling me who knows i wont even dignify that with a response why oh yeah then again thats easy for me to say since ill never even get a date im sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you im starting to think that even if i did get a girlfriend it really wouldnt change anything really thats the spirit maybe now you understand why i cant get a date oh uh its just this elastic thing i have to wear for lumbar support its just my stupid back ill be all right in a minute arrrghhh ah jeez christ oh uh thanks a lot enid i really appreciate it i dunno theyre very sensitive at work about all this stuff maybe it would be better if you what why no in a lot of ways things are better now i dunno its complicated everybody still hates each other but they know how to hide it better or something i make enough money to eat and buy old records what more do i want hey i get good benefits a good early retirement plan nobody ever bothers me nothing so glamorous actually im an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters for nineteen years actually i was a whole lot more interested in the cooks phenomenon when i was about your age ive kind of lost interest since ive been working for them yeah well cooks is just a made up name when they originally opened back in 1922 they were named the coon chicken inn thats an early painting of their first logo yeah right im a klansman thanks a lot do you know the cooks chicken franchise what oh that i borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago i guess its mine now if you dont mind my asking why do you care so much if i get a date or not yet im not sure i have anything to drink there might be some hooray for me but its not totally hopeless for you ive had it i dont even have the energy to try anymore you should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything i do so you dont end up like me yeah well its simple for everybody else give em a big mac and a pair of nikes and theyre happy i just cant relate to 999 of humanity look i really appreciate your help enid but lets face it this is hopeless now i remember why i havent gone anywhere in months im not even in the same universe as those creatures back there i might as well be from another planet jesus what did you tell that girl wait a minute hang on jesus i got ta think of something to talk to her about no no yes that would certainly do what are we in slow motion here what are ya hypnotized have some more kids why dont you for christs sake would you move im not holding my breath in that department i brought it for him to autograph hes going to be amazed to see it its one of two known copies i cant believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner what an insult that thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud its like someone jabbing me in the face kfto comin atchya on this beautiful evening uh i dont have much money with me right now these are older women just dressed up to look young i think shh i really dont think its a good idea i dont think so i id really rather not yeah sure very funny well are so is that your boyfriend well lets see i guess id have to put traditional jazz blues and ragtime music at the top of the list then probably maybe i dont want to meet someone who shares my interests i hate my interests where can i go to meet the exact opposite of myself i mean as long as shes not a complete imbecile and shes even remotely attractive im just not one of those guys who has a type jesus i really didnt get a good look at her i dont know what kind of question is that i mean its totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me jesus thats very nice of you enid but i i really i appreciate the offer but you really dont yeah well good luck oh right yeah right if im so cool why havent i had a girlfriend in four years i cant even remember the last time a girl talked to me you think its healthy to obsessively collect things you cant connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff im just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers please go ahead and kill me this stuff doesnt make you happy believe me i have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point ive tried to pare down my collection to the essential yeah well sure you can if you want to its just i dont want all these guys in there at once you know oh god no this is just junk i have for sale or trade the record room is offlimits i i didnt think you would have any interest in this get together i mean if you had told me you were coming i would have warned you its not like a real party or anything no watch my stuff do you want to see it i can run upstairs and get it the skip james record yeah thats a masterpiece there are no other records like that i actually have the original 78 of it in my collection its one of maybe five known copies so you really liked it yeah theres some really rare performances you liked that memphis minnie huh a dollar seventyfive this track alone by memphis minnie is worth about 500 if you have the original 78 she was one of the greatest guitar players that ever lived and a great singer and songwriter as well i know the guy who owns the original and lent it for use on this reissue nah its not so great heres the one id recommend well theres a few choice lps in here that reissue some really great old blues stuff theres some good stuff in here do you like old music those are all 78s can you play 78s i dont have anything after about 1935 i may have one hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection but its not really for sale i dont really collect foreign indian records yeah well thanks for cheering me up where else am i ever going to find another girl who likes geeshie wiley records she could at least have the decency to call me back yeah im really really happy really having a good time what fake blind date what are you talking about what are you talking about what do you mean did she say that why did you say she might be hiding from me did she say anything to you about me really i dont know enough about it to i have no idea i just want to she just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating i thought maybe she was i dont know maybe shes with josh why would she be hiding from me uh do you mind if i wait i really need to talk to her no they said she was here uh hi uh enids stepmother told me id find her here yes thank you doctor it doesnt pay very much but i should be able to afford my own place in a few months do you think thats too soon im really anxious to get my record collection out of storage well

personal life is ergo if i can teach table manners to mice i can teach them to humans if i can teach table manners to humans i can save the world courtesy decorum manners are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse rudeness vulgarity meanness are the norm the truth is most people dont have table manners today and when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels its my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice they can be taught to humans i hope you dont think me daft its important work its part of a larger sociological experiment im federally funded quite well really its a lot of work a lot of reinforcement mostly positive right now ive gotten two of my subjects to use napkins tiny napkins of

had youd have liked your grandmother and thered be a girl out there thatd have her mother i remember reading about her in the paper they couldnt find her father and her mother was dead i still feel guilty about that i think she was terrified of living with himbut maybe even more terrified of life without him to hide a black eye i was just thinking about my mom she wouldnt leave him i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses i mean it was dark outside and in but we never talked about it im proud of you sam if i asked you to stop would you what would you be doing now i gave up on you i wish you had told me then i couldnt imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you so i didnt he wanted you to have his last namei let him even take that when you started first grade and your mom went to work it was so she could save for an apartment but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting i know parts of who you are thats not true what are you now what would you like to be i know the feeling i know why hi alyssa try it it feels good do whatever you want with it i dont care all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together twenty years of hating what you live inwhat you are this is the end of it sam im gon na build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you you know that great thing though is that change can be so

youre what i was most of my life sam i see it in your eyes in your sleep in your answer to everything youre barely alive the game was to make me smaller than he was no matter what he could be almost invisible as a human being but i had to be smaller so if i got good grades i was a pussy for not playing football if i cut my hair for him it wasnt short enough if i shaved it i looked like a psycho i never won the game not once and if he couldnt make me smaller with words my dad used to play a game i never really understood what it was until after he was gone sit down for a second the gloves on

testified that you attended a meeting of a communist partyrun organization yet you just said under oath that you were not now nor ever a member of the communist party are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony are you now or have you ever been a member of the communist party mr chairman the witness is being nonresponsive all right mr appleton that was what you knew then what do you know now are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl we see it for the record it reads lucille angstrom whats the point of this start with what you knew then mr appleton please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the bread instead of bullets club referring to line thirtyseven of the document does your printed name and signature appear there good good now i hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the bread instead of bullets club of the university of california los angeles dated october 11 1935 a copy of this paper is before you mr appleton do you recognize it im interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past or if theyve been conveniently blotted out as a result of your accident and what is the state of your memory now anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your accident mr appleton an accident which conveniently came hard upon your dismissal from united pictures tell us this accident of yours are we given to understand that it affected your memory now i see that youve been running a movie theater in lawson called the bijou is that also true well im sure were all glad to see you came through it all right yes i see that private trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead i also see that you were posted stateside during the war fort dix is that because you were masquerading as luke trumbo while you were in lawson mr appleton do you know an albert lucas trumbothanks for the lift cecil well son youre home only one in town get in son listen to me the young man in there cecil cecil theres a young man in there dont tell me i know about these things ive seen it before its all

ernie son i think you loved the bijou even more than i did youve got to remember that youve got to i know its hard to believe son but this place this little place this wasnt a theater then this was a palace any man woman child you me it didnt matter you bought your ticket and you walked in and you fortytwo was a lean year around here the war had just started you were gone less than a month and we were coming off a bit of a drought as i recall not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket and a chickens as good as money if you ask me at that time it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures yes gary cooper and barbara stanwyck yowsa no your mother did then i did after she passed i promised him a new uniform when we reopened and youll get one too sixthirty i thought wed get an early start this is the staff of the bijou they couldnt wait to see you well yes that she was she certainly made this place a home thats lily your mother rest her soul oh i had irene and old tim but they really couldnt help much broke their hearts when we closed up broke mine too but now that youre back well things will be different around here thats for sure cmon ill show you where we live well after the war with so many of the towns boys killed people around here didnt much feel like going to the movies i guess some of em moved away los angeles sacramento san francisco wasnt much to keep em here i expect and now with this television thing people just arent going out as much as they used to hmmmm after you left it was difficult and then lily thats your mother she took ill and died we havent shown a picture since fortyeight weve been closed for a while waitll you see the inside nine andahalf years ago you joined up one month to the day after pearl harbor january seventh nineteen fortytwo you never came back from the war we were told you were missing and presumed dead albert lucas trumbo but youve been luke since you were a baby harry son

clyde fella wont be too happy about it but we cut a deal they cleared you and theyre gon na thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself you should keep track of your old school chums turns out she eventually joined the communist party on top of which shes lucy angstrom hirschfeld now and she happens to be a writer for studio one on cbs well thats not what they think what all of a sudden lucille angstrom isnt a name kid you gave them what they wanted this committee it feeds on names the more names the better but for some highprofile witnesses like yourself any name will do peter im an agent i buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you thats what i do youre a writer you write pictures thats what you do and trust me youll be back doing it again tomorrow morning what youre going

you gave them today we shoulda sold tickets peter dont let that stop you all of a sudden lest we forget peter your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than lukes next time it might be the fbi the time after that it might be the president but itll always be someone count on it exactly however youre gon na be subpoenaed to testify before the unamerican activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles now if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear theyll clear you the fbi cant arrest you because you havent done anything wrong dont say that there is no such thing as a blacklist now are you gon na play ball thats the one ashes to ashes i think its great but itll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head you cant work until youre cleared and believe me starting right now im gon na do everything i can to make that happen peter i believe in you more to the point i read your new script um they dont want you to testify because youre not a big enough fish for them they just dont want you writing pictures for now thats all you cant testify you broke your arm you were coming out of a bar you were drunk i know a purple heart fought come on pete you ran the px at fort dix they know you were at that meeting peter theyve been told and they know kid that cuts no ice with them you should watch what you say so youre saying that

yeah so where is he whats up bad coffee and women with excessive ankles id like to walk home with you and i require im not a scholar dottore but it seemed as if they as if they long overdue ive left my program who does not the commissioner is going round the cafe darling dr fell is studying for his examination by the studiolo darling dr fell my wife madame pazzi you know america how could you know and then it was adresa de pazzi depicted as john the baptist you have seen the chapel yes how did you know how so your scar you assemble this on the instant from these few observations why did you look at me that way you looked oddly at me back on the landing you have a recent scar on the back of your hand ill have them picked up of course in his offices if you come across anything any personal papers of his anything however trivial would you contact me please are his personal effects still at the palazzo you have taken over his offices is that not so i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note a farewell note a suicide note could you tell me did you ever meet your predecessor dottore fanelli yes but the important thing as ive said ask me when we get home the case that i am working on because we dont have any money because no invite us no he simply what do you expect me to i am on the track of my love why are we here in the first place i dont understand whatever is within my power fine thank you but the purpose of the exercise is it because they are expensive the shape of a three i want the money i know something no one knows he has had his finger removed on his left hand it left a scar i know where he is i know where he is hello a case so so fascinating so this is perhaps an inappropriate time but i would like to say it is an honor to meet the woman who solved the celebrated hannibal lechter but this particular statue it is a gravestone in the cemetery of in my native florence i know it well what a lovely perfume thank you is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt that the stars are far that his feelings do him honor and i have come simply to pay my respects to the great clarice starling but perhaps there is some some less radical solution sadly you were kind enough today to take my photograph an honor carlo pazzi brazilian speaking of the vacant post whatre they on about yes yes yes i cant remember ive got to make some money i feel that a liaison positionohforgodsake get on with it good evening dr lechter thank you for coming i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances follow starling stake out starling increase the pressure on starling he will come to her have the child taken to bed show me the pigs waal nobodys perfect what do we hear from our songbird in switzerland that operation has begun are we god that we would meddle with it no on the other hand make plans for lechters abduction where was the call from do it the puppy comes back if you lie on the ground the puppy with return why do you know why to kill you it thinks you have fallen and are powerless it comes back to tear your throat thats why the child turned back as lechter will return back you see to the sight of his oppressor wounded he will return to savage our beloved miss starling bring me a drink he turned back into the room where have we seen it before why did he come back why did the boy turn back why did he come back can we identify it as dr lechter yes but we know who it was and i will tell you agent starling what you know to be true i offered the bounty it was illegal and worse it was wrong and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder do you agent starling do you know god the government says mama has lost her job so she cant be your foster mother the police found a marijuana cigarette in your home you cant see mama anymore or shirley or kitty cat thats what the government says yes franklin you cant live there anymore with mama and shirly and kittykat you have to go away yes yes do you like it at your home franklin shes not the first foster that youve had is she in and out yes and mama and mama is not your real mama is she franklin where do you live oh no no it wont be that long is it necessary to know tell them make them eat the figurine when i after you re dead and when i give the word do you understandwhen i give the word and what would be of greater help than to release her from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence dont you think in which the innocent are tortured in ways which would make the anguish of the damned seem tame and unimaginative dont you think blind him again and prepare him and her for the pigs yes to cease to hope is the greatest crime the greatest crime perhaps the only crime i never ceased to hope youre free explain in depth the plan we have for him until tomorrow you dont wish to beg are you done why should you care thank you cordell i have not i would not for life life goes on starling and wait wait i wish to talk to you im one moment i was afflicted do you see but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr lechter i was afflicted before before do you see in my arrogance do not do not curse god when you are humiliated listen to me embrace it and you embrace life listen and you hear the word of god isnt it funny you can look on my face which you would grant me is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life you can look at me which shows a strength which must come from strong strong convictions but you shy when i say the name of god my encounter large resources starling which i prefer to devote elsewhere and why would you suspect me of this ghoulishness because because we must leave the past in the past ah and here we have artifacts of yes my own encounter with him ah yes ah yes our doctor lechter and have they sent you once again to capture him how terrible for you for the worst hurt of course that which will not heal is the conviction no one caresi couldnt tell herits its too majorjesus im starting to believe in god and whats worse i think i like the guy the lightning bolt was just a test right wendy and iwere meant to be im right right i have to see her im in the picture on wendys wall niagara falls family trip little wendy foreground me background what are the odds on that one shes still pissed at me and took it out on you we should have taken it slower its hard to operate in the woods much easier in like a club tell the girl youve got to go do something leave her view take way

painfully overused word in the current english language i thought if i could reverse the meaning of sucks so it means something positive i dont knowit would be vaguely revolutionary its kind of my social experiment for the summer suck is historically a nice word snocones your motherswhere is it going to the coast was alans idea if hes alive thats where hes headed we need to stick to the plan head for the coast hes right a predator wouldnt leave a kill wounded here whos that how low it wont hold sure dr grant was i dont know they set a trap they actually set a trap about a thousand feet above it actually most mountainclimbers remember how tall that mountains were so mr kirby tell me when you climbed k2 did you base camp at 25 or 30000 feet that was isla nublar this is isla sorna the second island i know the consequences i can get him you have to believe me i did it with the best intentions alan i want to tell you that im so sorry about the alan we could cowrite a paper it looks intact i dont remember that on ingens list baryonyx obviously a superpredator suchimimus that snout is it a rex im so use to seeing bones its weird to see skin listen alan i really appreciate you bringing me along it was this strap alone that saved my life got caught on a rock as i was falling no way this is lucky couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand updraft sent me right into the side boom theyre here its a rapid prototyper i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints one layer on top of the other its the future of paleontology three weeks i had to rent some equipment how was your trip profitablehe loves you too then we should we have to keep looking for dad we have to wheres dad dad what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs were safe no i couldnt see you should the lady you called how do you know she can help us something mustve scared them but then you never get to go in space i want to be an astronaut do you have any kids then we go home closer you get to the water the bigger things get are you sure i stayed pretty close to the compound figured if anyone came to look for me thats where theyd start mines new know what this is i dunno i mean it was kind of preachy chaosthis chaosthat and like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself yeah is that all its been i thought it was longer found this but the batterys dead when ingen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind the first one before you where on the island you liked dinosaurs back then youre alan grant arent you i read both of your books theyll never make it i mean they cant manage when the cable goes out in costa ricaa bird cage oh my god one way to find out this is how you play god quiet after what youve seen today you really think your son could be alive a few of us survived a lot more died and we were better prepared and better armed how many days have they been missing and tell your wife to stop making so much noise were food to these damn animals no some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions you rushed in with no thought to the consequences to yourself or anyone else youre no better than the people who built this place billy i cant talk to you now we need to keep moving keep going ah yes the first rule of academics publish or perish we should take it with us to signal any planes thats because it wasnt on their list who knows what else they were up to not with that sail spinosaurus aegypticus they never got that big how would you classify it i dont think so mr and mrs kirby if you look out the right you can see the bones will be there when we get back thats the nice thing about them they never run away and besides you got me into this i dont intend to be alone with these people reversedarwinism survival of the most idiotic that does sound lucky even with what i pay you you could get a better bag what absolutely not not if it cant dig you rented an automated litter box well be broke in four weeks a wellaccepted theory okay goodbye ellie id better get going the last of my breed it was never easy but before jurassic park you could find money somewhere now fossils are out everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur to a degree we never imagined weve done cranial scans and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence the way they can work together as a team you remember the sounds they made raptors mostly really what do you do there he used to know me hmm the population will stabilize eventually theyll adapt to fit different roles no were not do me a favor go back to your parents for a minute would you they look worried eric do you know what happened to the boat that brought you here why did it crash youre right its strikes me now i never told her that shes the one person i could always count on and shes saved me more times than she realizes i owe her everything bonitas exactly the difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are to be able to touch them thats what billy wanted to do see i was the opposite i never understood why anyone would want to go into space its so dangerous you do one thing wrong and youre dead the astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety and truthfully everything you really need to learn you can learn it from the ground i have a theory that theres two kinds of boys those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts no although ive studied them in the wild we climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean with any luck the costa rican coast guard will pick us up why we need to head for the coast how much of this island have you explored a raptor claw i use to have one a fossil what did you think did you read malcolms book the important thing is we both made it thats something we have in common its a wonder you arent im amazed eric i barely lasted 30 hours you lasted eight weeks any weapons radios back then they hadnt tried to eat me which one do you prefer youd be surprised what people can do when they have too on the island eric your parents are both here well we dont exactly have a costa rican phone book here so it will have to be somebody we know in the states someone we can absolutely count on to send help billy back out move but you never came across just one there is no kirby enterprises is there you can stick with us or you can go and look for him either way youre probably not getting out of here alive no im sorry but no well savage what we can from the plane then we head for the coast there may be a boat left something to get us off this island i have never been on this island mr kirby trust me on this island there is no such thing as safe we have to get back in this plane what the hell is going on what are they doing this plane can not land thats hard to believe im flattered but ive taken this little adventure tour and with the air restrictions theyve imposed after the incident in san diego you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest thats a very nice offer mr kirby but im afraid im much to busy if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified hmmm you know ive been traveling and im very tired maybe some other time what can i do for you mr kirbyeither that or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age you mean it he could have died i should have tried it should have been me on that beach back there not billy my own kid was right in front of me and i didnt do a damn thing im trying that thing took him down this way were not going anywhere i promise never had a doubt never did us kirby men we stick around huh i loaned it to nash he must have had it on him when he i dont remember i dont know i dont have it with me that one time was just the bumper well damn it i dont speak ill of the dead what im trying to say is its was just a crazy accident the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me you cant go beating yourself up about it i want to find them too but we cant do a bit of good right now for every scary thing we saw in the daylight ill bet there ten times more of em at night am i right its not safe udesky eric are you here i know you liked ben i had no right to im sorry amanda i am and im sorry for the things i said about him thats him thats eric young adult what did you say what did you say what fineand when the tricyclatops comes after you dont come crying to me well whats the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him no dr grant says stop that dr grant says this is dangerous territory you look good people change twenty twentyfire pounds ive been swimming at the y sorry we called everyone did everything we could because of all the controversy over this island no one will step in costa rica says its a nofly zone its their own damn fault guys at the us embassy our us embassy said we should accept the inevitable you believe that her new boyfriend dont worry honey well circle around and come back he says its a bad idea amanda honey dr grant says its a bad idea well im no aviation specialist but i do know its hell of a lot lower than anyone else weve arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna and we want you to be our guide amanda and i well we just love the outdoors heck weve been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with galapagos k2 the nile first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts amanda and i have admired your work for years eric hes probably has a better chance by the coast as it is figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island right i thought you were an expert they couldnt climb up so they were trying to get us to come down thirtythousand i think closer to the top i didnt know there were two islands stan whatever you do dont call the us embassy they wont do a god damn thing its no use dr grant no use amanda well thats good there is i own a place called kirby paint and title plus were out in the westgate shopping center in enid oklahoma the plus is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces accessories patio furniture stuff like that dr grant were not leaving without our son sure you have you wrote that book we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land somebody whod been to this island before establishing a perimeter making it safe these guys are really good one of them was a green dr grant if youd just sit tight well explain this all in a jiffy lets just say that through my business importsexports emerging markets ive made some friends in high places in this case the costa rican government no no see dr grant youre the best youve seen these animals in the flesh no one else has come close to you now for our wedding anniversary this year we

out the transfer i did it to say thanks to honor you sir what the french call a homage how could it be irresponsible sir if you were the first man in the world to do it it must of been a convincing letter what of course i forgive you i know what you feel for danny is real and your choice is your choice i need to tell you something i didnt know what it was to lose somebody to see death and find

nice to meet you betty hello lieutenant good to see you crank her learn english then and if you dont give me a plane that can handle combat you better start learning to speak german all of em the struts are loose the hydraulics are leaking and the electrical systems shorting out in the cockpitseal the cave no sir i havent forgotten a doll alone proves nothing true but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit i apologize indeed the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own some of the evidence is uncontestable weve never meant to be treasonable sir but up there in the face of that cliff is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts how did you know wed come here yes sir so it was thanks to you but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written certainly sir its a pleasure to see you again oh no sir i was just assembling my notes dr zaius certainly sir ill get my notes and come right over they cant convict us of that you proved our innocence besides his culture is our culture that was different we thought you were inferior what are you doing there taylor id rather you taylor youre not in command here put down that gun right now if you like no one really knows its an ancient taboo set forth in the sacred scrolls the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly it empties into a sea some miles from here thats where the cave is sorry taylor the terrain around that lake is poisonous there is no fresh water no vegetation nothing its a long detour to dead lake what would we find to the diggings i worked at a year ago its a three day ride across the eastern desert near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours as you wish the best but we wont need them well taylor were all fugitives now right lets put the water and provisions in the wagon how did it go zira zira listen to me weve got a fine future ahead of us marriage stimulating careers im up for a raise no thank you i wont get into that battle because if he is a missing link it means the sacred scrolls arent worth their parchment that was before dr zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy the evidence was very meager its probably wrong no they wont zira are you trying to get my head cut off i dont and im not going to try no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone ive been there ive seen it flight is a scientific impossibility and they fell out of the sky with you now just a minute where did you learn to do this its a stunt humans dont write zira come on you know they cant oh oh here comes number one remembers what whats so special about him neither do i do you have to work tonightgood luck then and now you know the truth cornelius has beaten you doctor he proved it man preceded you here you owe him your science your language whatever knowledge you have reconstructing a life care to have a look yes i have to agree from all youve found so far his positions as good as yours no you saved me from this fanatic maybe i can pay you back shut up if theres any shooting dr zaius youll be the first to die depend on it when are you going to show me whats in the cave youve never told me why this regions called the forbidden zone where does the river lead i know nevertheless i thank you for saving us youll be in trouble for going there nothing much the remnants of a life raft maybe a small flag the emblem of my countrymen you still dont believe me do you zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone thats what well try for what about you just the same i want one do you have any weapons well at least they havent tried to bite us lets find them all youre more than three hundred light years from your precious planet your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries even if you could get back theyd think you were something that fell out of a tree none at all that way okay if theres no life here weve got just seventytwo hours to find it thats when the groceries run out any sign of dangerous ionization good question landon check your communications kit one pistol twentyfour rounds of ammo two medical kits one camera one tx9 weve enough food and water for three days geiger counter got your sensors show this to the president some apes it seems are more equal than others i admit i know nothing of your culture youre our optimist look at the bright side if thats the best there is around here in six months well be running this planet no cigar okay lets take a look but im not prepared to die dont bother oh and one last item immortality you wanted to go on forever well you damn near made it except for dodge and me youve lived longer than anybody and with stewart dead it looks like were the last of the strain you got what you wanted kid how does it taste and the glory dont forget that theres a lifesized bronze statue of you somewhere its probably turned green by now and nobody can read the name plate but never let it be said we forget our heroes straighten me out on something why did you come along at all you volunteered why ill tell you they nominated you for the big one and you couldnt turn it down not without losing your allamerican standing theres only one reality left were here and its now you get ahold of that and hang on tight or you might as well be dead what would you learn ive told you where you are and when you are its a fact landon buy it youll sleep better because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for theyre dust apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man whos two thousand and thirty one years old i read the clocks they bear out hassleins hypothesis weve been away from earth for two thousand years give or take a decade still cant accept it huh by our time youve turned gray its a little late for a wake shes been dead nearly a year air leak died in her sleep landon join the expedition were some three hundred and twenty light years from earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion that could be bellatrix were here to stay forget it abandon ship to earth that weve landed landon send a last signal the flags of discontent its the only way anything ever gets changed dont try to follow us im pretty handy with things like this thats the boy keep em flying lucius ill start by following the shoreline and my nose i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner all right all right will you do me a favor no orders not everything they left a hostage how do you feel lucius relax youll see it all later sorry lucius youll have to stay here and guard the horses in my world before i left it only youngsters of your age wore un scraped hair im for that fine just let her out i want her she comes along too come on get me out of here who are you you destroyed his memory his mind his identity and you want to do the same to me one is in a museum this hearing is absurd let me tell my story my name is taylor were back at the beginning i still dont know the why a planet where apes evolved from men a world turned wrong side up a puzzle with one piece missing what evidence no weapons were found in the cave why from the first ive terrified you doctor and in spite of every sign that im an intelligent being who means no harm you continue to hate and fear me why no thanks ill take freedom sure in a cage then there is another jungle he might have been wiped out by a plague natural catastrophe like a fiery storm of meteors from the looks of this part of your planet id say that was a fair bet tell him to pull back i dont say he was a man like an earthman but id call him a close relative for he was plagued by most of mans ills yet fragile as he was he came before you and was superior to you okayup to the cave very well if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls dont tell the whole truth of your history if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them when were the sacred scrolls written all right lets see if youre willing to put that statement to a test stop right there im not protecting anybody that hearing was a farce what have i done i dont know thank you for calling me taylor dr zaius i know who i am who are you how did this upside down civilization ever get started then you admit all right suppose i am a mutant why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic thats exactly what zira and cornelius claim youre talking heresy doctor i take it you dont believe the prosecutors charge that im a monster created by dr zira what about it my tribe as you call it lives on another planet in a distant solar system i told the truth at that hearingof yours no what about me with one of them god bless you dr zira id like to kiss you goodbye its better than going to prison for heresy would you like to come along wasnt i humiliated by all of you didnt you lead me around on a leash why not then tell them dr zaius wont leave here alive he has a point on my planet children often play with ape dolls except that hes also the chief defender of the faith and thats your minister of science honor bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge whats the diagnosis doctor a touch of the sun you threw us together remember and you guessed right men like apes get despondent without a mate maybe not yes youre going back to the forbidden zone listen you did this to him youve removed his frontal lobes you you knew about this second from the left its himlandon what is this where have you been why didnt you come to see me im not acting i can talk how much proof do you want my name isnt bright eyes its taylor listen listen i can speak thats correct and you will both stand trial for heresy well for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed keep digging cornelius youll find evidence of the master of this house an ape your conclusion is premature have you forgotten your scripture the thirteenth scroll and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree and the children made sport of him to begin with your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations dont speak to me in absolutes the evidence is contestable ive seen some of your fossils and artifacts theyre worthless i ask you to reconsider the rash course youve taken if youre convicted of heresy the most youll get is two years but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction youll hang for high treason it wasnt difficult only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone i see you brought along the female of your species i didnt realize a man could be monogamous he exceeded his orders his travel permit was promptly revoked you know dr maximus our commissioner for animal affairs did you forget our appointment cornelius cornelius if you have a moment today id like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail dont look for it taylor you may not like what you find the forbidden zone was once a paradise your breed made a desert of it ages ago because you are a man and you were right i have always known about man from the evidence i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy his emotions must rule his brain he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself where else but in a cage does man belong of course you could return with us our society might find a place for you and your mate then answer this if ran was superior why didnt he survive cease fire withdraw thats lunacy i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects thats equally as inventive as yours but it would be conjecture not proof of course twelve hundred years ago what is your proposal there is no contradiction between faith and science true science dont be a fool youre outnumbered and outgunned youre a menace a walking pestilence i do know who you are taylor as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone you have just six hours to make a full confession after that ill employ surgery to obtain one guards if you are protecting others of your kind it will cost you your identity you may well call it upside down since you occupy its lowest level and deservedly the eastern desert has never been explored because weve always assumed that no life can exist there save yourself taylor tell me is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone i admit that where theres one mutant theres probably another and another a nest of them wheres your nest taylor where are your women because youre not unique there was the one you call landon of course certainly not youre a mutant a fort unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent where were you nurtured then how is it we speak the same language even in your lies some truth slips through that mythical community youre supposed to come from fort wayne you lied where is your tribe however its within my power to grant you a reprieve that is why i summoned you here tonight tell me who and what you really are and where you come from and no veterinary will touch you emasculation to begin with then experimental surgery on the speech centers on the brain ultimately a kind of living death oh your case was preordained in a way you performed a service for the state because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody forfinal disposition do you know what that means identify him then speak to him welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures in a few minutes there will be no doll there cant be im sorry he wont survive do you know what sort of life awaits you out there taylor that of an animal if you arent eventually hunted down and killed by apes some jungle beast will devour you what secondly if these tools as you call them are unidentified why are they introduced as evidence of anything let them talk mr president let them talk mr president i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes how sad stuffed and mounted eh dead men like sunken ships can tell no stories and his other companion where are they now but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture do you believe him dr zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert wouldnt it more properly be done in your office of course he saw you moving yourssir im working on a big case over here and by the time i get back theyre gon na make you governor

you just dont care let me ask you not as your guidance counselor butas a friend what do you want to do with your life i mean what kind of longterm goals can you possibly have all right scooby lets not beat around the bush with your attitude youre not going to get in anywhere none at all how about those underground comics any books you like to read for funno prob im cool oh like what what hey whats up be your sidekick you know and maybe eventually become a tv talk show host well i was thinkingi might work for you great to be here thank you ill be your guest conan obrien whoa what are you doing

like conversation just the same the same dad im trying to figure things out right now ok its like really hard and im just listening to some old elton john and i dunno fuck i dunno see if i have any connections well i meani wan na be on tv maybe have a talk show or something like conan or early letterman i dunno ok i hate reading no no not really you want some yeah i know yeah you should be im not an idiot man i watch tv is it loaded gee your dads smart howd you get it pretty cool stanley dont be your movies a hit oh he did i dunno id like to be good at something it doesnt have to be tv i mean it could be moviesanything id be willing to direct thanks man can i see what you have so far hey um toby i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished 200 verbal710 math kinda weird i know but i think they thought it was like goodweird prnceton so like yeahi caved in i mean i had to my parents theyre like still really depressed about brady so i wrote the bullshit essay filled out the applications did the interviewsyknow i figure i can always drop out whoopee doubt it is this to like get into sundance what for oh you mean like blair witch project you a perverti dont know maybe theyll like it well i need to see this with an audience hip alternative types who will understand the process better ok then we can invite serious intellectual types ok youre right youre right you know we need to screen what weve gotinvite some regular people just some random offthe street typesand see what real people think of this nothing i guess no no no no exploitation this is seriousbut dont you find it a little funny too at the same time yes i knowbut still it should be somewhat entertaining you think so you dont think that this might not be a little dry thanks ill tell mike well its still just a beginning i know i candig deeper yes i do i love them im not making fun im showing it as it really is so whaddya think but mr livingston arent you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism but what kind of pull did you have oh i know i know that well sharing your story your ups and downs and so forth can i hope be an illuminating experience cause scooby does have a quality that ive been looking for a quality that is emblematic of american today its part disillusionment part hope scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds youre absolutely right the focus is on the college admissions process today maybe she has caller id yeah sure wow that really is great in a few years who knows maybe theyll

before you kicked me in the head ythink yeah spit from your dad i dont know and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table excuse me vendela have you seen diane were supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonightmajor arnold believes he has a moral duty too i dont know on all what and this only one of these letters major i have lots of them when he met hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him was he pleased yesterday i read that furtwngler was asked to lead the new york philharmonic back in 36 toscanini suggested it had he accepted he would have become the most celebrated conductor in america but i promised your mother i dont know right so this is going to be very formal too now lieutenant david wills requests die pleasure of die company of fraulein emmi straube at dinner any night she cares eating is eating and respect your elders and your betters thats right i was raised very strictly so dont speak before you are spoken to major show me someone who hasnt made an antisemitic remark and ill show you the gates of paradise yes im a jew but i like to think first im a human being major he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect when you question him again could you treat him with more respect can i ask you a favour major your manner major thats not a good argument if dr furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these these privileges he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is thats true of any leading artist in any country in the world and totally irrelevant major this is deeply offensive and repugnant major i dont see how this line of questioning could why not show dr furtwngler the evidence it may refresh his memory yes what was the orchestras reaction when they asked you to play for hitlers birthday five minutes major richards said hed call to let us know i dont know but the british are excited about it i know that the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich the british occupy the building where this guy hinkel ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems theyve theyve discovered his secret archive yes theyre trying to sort out some of the works of art the nazis stole from occupied territories who really owns what thats colonel dymshitz on the far side colonel dymshitz asked specially to see you i guess its possible some was born here in leipzig i escaped in 36 my parents they sent me to my uncle in philadelphia they were to follow but they delayed and i guess so sir david david wills im your liaison officer with the allied kommandatura cultural affairs committee sir im very sorry lieutenant wills reporting to major arnold siri love my country i believe in music what was i to do how can i know such a thing bruckners seventh the adagio of course i know what that is speaking to party members i used their language of course i did everyone did those attitudes do not exist in me i dont understand what you mean i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter stop this please stop this now i said i have illegitimate children i dont know how many i have illegitimate children of course there was a conspiracy against me a campaign even abroad this is absolute nonsense yes thats what happened please stop playing these games with me why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding im sorry i have no idea he said dont mind him his job is to criticise your job is to conduct well once he said hed read what this man wrote about me thats an outrageous lie yes i know who he is von der null von der null no because i had only one intention my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics have no idea what ordinary people thought we never never officially represented the regime when we played abroad we always performed as a private ensemble as i think i already told you i was a freelance conductor then you are wrong you wont find it because no such telegram exists i dont have to think carefully this is utterly ridiculous i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings i have no idea what youre talking about what telegram i believe art and politics should be separate but that they werent kept separate i learned to my cost maintain liberty humanity and justice when i last saw you i was unprepared i did not know what to expect in these past weeks i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes you have to understand who i am and what i am i am a musician and i believe in music i am an artist and i believe in art art in general and music in particular has for me mystical powers which nurture mans spiritual needs i must confess however to being extremely naive i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics my entire life was devoted to music because and this is very important because i thought that i could through music do something practical i wish to say something it is now nine oclock precisely i do not intend to be kept waiting again he told me to be careful as one of goebbels men was watching me he read a report on me everything i said was quoted word by word goering because hinkel was working for goebbels i was warned i wasnt told i just knew it certainly not but i knew he had informers everywhere even in my orchestra there was someone yes a despicable human being he was in the ministry of culture his job was to get rid of jews in the arts ive had enough of this im leaving they were jews they had to leave they were right to leave i could not leave my country in her deepest misery after all i am a german i i stayed in my homeland is that my sin in your eyes if you are going to bully me like this major you had better do your homework you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are it would be truer to say i think that a lot of people in high places knew me during an enforced hourlong interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin albert speer the minister of armaments said to me you look very tired dr furtwngler you should go abroad for a while i knew exactly what he meant i believe it was because of another letter id written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me then why is it please that another conductor who was actually a member of the party who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait i need to work i need to make my living i live off the generosity of friends when will my case be heard by the tribunal may i ask a question i may have as as i said i simply dont remember i dont remember in detail there were so many its the truth i made no deal could i have a glass of water please please fraulein that that was a different matter i i was tricked i did not conduct at at the rally i conducted on the evening before the rally well there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture i was simply a pawn anyway i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra in 1934 i dont think dr goebbels sent me a telegram i was simply told in a letter i believe i dont remember exactly i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse after the dreadful events of november 1938 the violent attacks on the jews i stopped using the title that is correct i have already been cleared by a denazification tribunal in austriaand ask him about his private life yes yes you may notice that he can not even bring himself to utter his name he he refers to him as k also a conductor very brilliant young von der null called him the miracle von karajan furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army the same thing happened to another critic true or not its not such a bad idea critics give you bad reviews you have them sent to the russian front but if you really want to get furtwngler ask him about herbert von karajan edwin von der null music critic he gave furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan theres a rumour i dont know if its true or not but ask him about von der null no but thats why we hated him we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didnt have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us he didnt have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad he got everything from them everything he was filthier than any of us party members yes a corporal us army a jew he said hed seen the telegram in the chancellery one of your people told me furtwngler sent hitler a telegram for his birthday ive remembered something else the only thing i know is hes an antisemite major were discussing a man of genius i dont want you dont know what its like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified you dont know that i was a member of the communist party i was a communist thats what hinkel had over me he knew everything he held that over me thats how he made me cooperate what you usually dont work on sunday major so you wanted to see me exactly replaces the baton gives steve the case not here major there are people if anybody should see please please major show you yes you remember its dr furtwnglers baton which i stole guess what i am holding in my hand you like guessing games major how could i know whats in the archive i hear the british have his his archive files records hans hinkel was in the ministry of culture how could i know such a man i do i know hans hinkel do i know hans hinkel oh we didnt play for his birthday we played the evening before it was the 19th of april not the 20th excuse me did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience is it true youre going to interview dr furtwngler today me never never it means i wasnt good enough to be a first violinistwhat is it with you david where are your feelings wheres your hatred your disgust wheres your fucking outrage david a human being oh good im relieved i thought you were going to say you were a music lover this man this great artist has made antisemitic remarks like you wouldnt believe i got letters david i dont understand a thing about you youre a jew are you a jew with more what more what yeah my manner why dont you go downstairs get a cup of coffee and calm down whats the matter emmi whats going on with you whats wrong what but it still doesnt make them saints they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night dont they they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me well just like me cant they not so counsellor that secretary of yours she wasnt just your secretary she procured women for you didnt she as many and as often as you wanted you bet isnt it true that before every concert you got a woman in your dressing room and gave her the old conductors baton isnt that true david what are you counsel for the defence now did you hear the question you see wilhelm im talking about ordinary everyday reasons which is why i want to discuss your private life how many illegitimate children do you have yes david you have a question for helmuth david its a bet youre the witness emmi okay better question the next witness i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes thats big of him jeez and you think the britishll share it with their allies whats that mean so what is it david need to ask you something you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive what the hell are they doing dimshits so what does the russki want you think a whole orchestra what a hundred and forty or so guys could be orchestrated dont this is like a criminal investigation david musicians morticians doctors lawyers butchers clerks theyre all the same i guess you admire musicians where you from david you call me sir again and ill make you listen to beethoven sounds a lot of run so they sent the big guns to check up on me we recruiting children now im steve whats your name for chrissakes i hate that shit cut it out im gon na get that fucking bandleader colonel no deal no fucking deal i have a duty no can do what museum this is what im saying he must have had party contacts yeah yeah art and politics yeah yeah i heard all about that but what before that turns rotten what if they surround the space with barbed wire colonel colonel he had no sisters no brothers only a lot of love affairs thats why he didnt get the hell out of here when he had the chance i put that to him he couldnt answer why didnt he go and direct in america like that italian toscanini were dealing with degenerates here i was in vienna i had with me an austrian chauffeur max his name was he spent time in the camps we were looking at these viennese cleaning up the bomb damage scavenging for rotting food butt ends anything i said to think a million of these people came out to welcome adolf on the day he entered the city a million of em and now look at em and max said oh not these people major these people were all at home hiding jews in their attics you get the point colonel the point is theyre all full of shit not yet colonel pleasure if he had no idea why did the jews need saving this is the question emmi to all germans why did the jews need saving in this country why if people had no idea emmi stop i want to show you something let me show you something and then if you want to leave you can leave please please his friends they did this and he gave them birthday concerts whats not right what is this emmi put it on ready to play and ill tell you when to play it do you know where the adagio begins shut the door emmi sit down emmi were going to keep him waiting too come in emmi this is your office too emmi this is lieutenant david wills you tell him nothing emmi if he calls again you say you know nothing were gon na keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses and god help me with beethoven whats in those files im kidding emmi what about a record player you have that too mines the eleventh think you can get me any of that steve and your father was executed your mother too says here because of your father whats that mean okay lets see how long were you in the camp for you do shorthand and typing you live here in berlin look around you see the country you served look at people who had real courage who took risks who risked their lives like emmis father have you ever smelled burning flesh i smelt it four miles away four miles away i smelt it have you ever seen the gas chambers the crematoria have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses you talk to me about culture art and music you putting that in the scales wilhelm you setting culture art and music against the millions put to death by your pals they had orchestras in the camps they played beethoven wagner the hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families i dont understand the germans relationship with music what do you need music for your pals you could call to save a few jews when millions of them were being annihilated yes i blame you for not getting hanged i blame you for your cowardice you strutted and swaggered you fucking piece of shit kingpin in a shithouse you talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows and i say to you lies ill tell you then the last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal hitler had shot himself listen to it they listen did they pick little ks recording did they pick some other conductor no they picked you and why because you represented them so beautifully when the devil died they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march you were everything to them whos conducting okay so what is it do you know what that is i believe that but just answer the question dont give me explanations everybody says what a great benefactor you were to the jews but i have things here you said and wrote listen to this the jew composer schonberg is admired by the jewish international and what about this jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with our music jewish musicians are good businessmen with few scruples lacking roots you deny you said these things no thats your problem wilhelm you understand nothing well call you go okay wilhelm go home now go home and think about these past twelve years but you see what im getting at you get a gorgeous house youre highly paid what are you gon na do stay or leave one voice comes back at me stay no im not going to stop it hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter you like the women dont you wilhelm what well im just beginning to develop my theme isnt that what you call it in classical music developing your theme okay so they played on your insecurity thats human understandable but there is one guy who doesnt like little k as much as he likes you yeah the number one man your old pal adolf he thinks youre the greatest and when he says i want wilhelm for my birthday boy they better go out get wilhelm so josef calls and threatens you with little k and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna ill give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin thats the trick they played they got you by the balls and they squeezed hard why did you stay why did you play for them why were you the flagcarrier for their regime jealousy come on admit it k worried you didnt he he always worried you in 1942 hes thirtyfour years old youre already fiftysix and goebbels and goering keep saying to you if you dont do it little k will never mind art and politics and symbols and airyfairy bullshit about liberty humanity and justice because i dont care how great you are its the oldest story in the book the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck the real reason you didnt leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that once you were out of the way youd be supplanted by the miracle kid the partys boy twice over flashy talented little k ill tell you why you remember we talked about you playing for hitlers birthday and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first that you were tricked now that young conductor whats his name that miracle kid you know who i mean von karajan but you called him something else cmon what did you call von karajan youve really no idea ill tell you what happened he died in stalingrad and what happened to von der nul and what did he say you sure you didnt call one of your close buddies and say god in heaven did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me the greatest conductor on earth i want him out the way he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music send him to stalingrad isnt that what you did you dont like criticism do you wilhelm you surely didnt like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels isnt it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy von karajan called him a goddamn miracle said he was a better conductor than you then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no ones heard from him since how longs this going to go on wilhelm i say von der null you say von der null i say von der null you say von der null we could go on all day you know who von der null is dont you edwin von der nuell music critic yes von der null tell me about von der null no you know something you shouldve written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity what do you imagine people thought the berlin philharmonics taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance so art and politics are now entirely separate is that what you believed ordinary people thought art and politics yeah art and politics lets look at that you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich played in countries the nazis had conquered are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasnt a commercial for adolf and all he stood for well i tried you got to admit i tried i thought i might just trap you there wilhelm but david here was too quick for me smart move david smart move no i dont have the telegram but i know it exists and i want you to know wilhelm were going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it think carefully wilhelm maybe not in your own name but as privy councillor or vicepresident the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal adolf hider happy birthday dear adolf love wilhelm or words to that effect that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying okay adolf you win youre the number one man have a swell party and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram was that the surrender signal the waving of the white flag gee thats a thing of beauty honest to god a real thing of beauty im going to try to remember that liberty humanity and justice beautiful but you used the word naive are you now saying you think you were wrong that art and politics cant be separated and what was that go ahead be my guest if its too hot open your tie dont talk to me like i was a second violinist go back into the waiting room miss straube will come and get you when i am ready to see you oh boy youre gon na love this take your time with this now those files contain the details of every working artist in this country those files are gon na tell us who joined the party who informed and who was helpful what did goering say who warned you how who yup thats him thats the guy you know what else the little creep did he kept files close on 250000 files and you know whats in those files ive got to hand it to the british david you know what those guys are decent tell me herr dr furtwngler do you know hans hinkel steve arnold see david he cant answer the question ill ask it again wilhelm and dont give me any more airyfairy intellectual bullshit i have a list of names here people in your profession who got out in 33 bruno walter otto klemperer arnold schoenberg max reinhardt you were real close to all of them to adolf to hermann to joseph to baldur and now albert so lets hear the truth lets come clean what was your party number you sure knew a lot of people in high places so how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you you didnt complain about the racial policies just about the musical standards is that right why were they going to arrest you i dont know he wasnt my case why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended tough tough your guess is as good as mine sure or maybe you called goebbels or goering you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them let me me help you then you picked up the phone and made a call hello adolf wilhelm speaking listen old pal theres a jewboy musician i want you to help he needs a permit to get to paris did you call someone you knew i keep hearing you helped a lot of jews to escape how did you do that i dont buy that how come that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies wilhelm and what about april 19 1942

criminal mastermind the da made me out to be how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadnt had a chance to trot out for doris i got ta hand it to him he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes he talked about how id lost my place in the universe i tried to tell him the whole story but riedenschneider stopped me he said

your problem friend this is a business establishment with posted hours were just closing friendand inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women who among us is in a position to say a puny player on the great worlds stage not guilty your honor who who i dont know who but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time hes spent persecuting this woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoes past then we might know who but we cant know what really happened because of fritz or werner or whatever the hell his name is and because me prosecutor is also a lazy fatassed sonofabitch who decided its easier to victimize your wife because its easier not to look because the more you look the less you know but the beauty of it is we dont got ta know we just got ta show that goddamnit they dont know reasonable doubt science the atom you explain it to me go ahead try did big dave mention that it was something about his war service i dont know i wasnt there youll have to tell us maybe he specified maybe he didnt im not putting words in your mouth the point is that this liar this cynical manipulator this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who did serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores and who made a fool out of this entire town turns to you to help him out of his jam fatassed sonofabitch and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego you asked for blackmail let me give you blackmail mr halefellowwellmet about to open

mr manzetti is still walking around breathing the air an investment banking house lina the thousandyear reich barely lasted a decade do you really want to go down that road again in america of all places where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues yes of course but that only plays in this room with people who arent embarrassed to call themselves nazis if you want a modern fascism you dont mention jews i thought we agreed no anti semitismits exactly what were trying to put behind us trash the blacks fine but that doesnt seem to be happening does it we want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream works like ithe bell curvei isociobiologyi antizionism anti immigration the communitarian issue well hold conferences invite liberals blacks jews chomsky cockburn stanley crouch shahack whats that okay surprise us they left an hour ago you mind some personal advice forget carla thats not the side your breads buttered on how soon can you get back to the city leo strauss ive got to go to boston i came to say goodbye im sure they are but what do we accomplish by pointing it out insulting people who were in the camps whats the point how would you kill him but when it comes out the public will be outraged it will look like germany all over again you wouldnt announce it they used to today its not an issue that would be a catastrophic mistake decentralized nonviolent increasingly mainstream well see antiabortion antiimmigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby christian identity types tax resisters and even some libertarians more cultural than politicalthe nazis did everything the fhrer told them you do everything the torah tells you or the rebbe identical slave mentality read the early zionists on european jewry they sound like goebbels they had sabra and shattila theyre racist theyre militaristic they act like bullyboys in the territories whereas avis a zionist nazi whats a fascist they only kill them when they love them just dont yeah but not on the letters no you dont if you hated them youd study them so youd know why you hate them you know what tefillin is tsitsis shotness you know the kaddish from the kiddush eichmann he went to israel he studied the torah the talmud the mishnah the whole bit he hated jews how come you dont know it how can you say you hate the jews when you dont know anything about the mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters they thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there with secret alternative meanings its called the flame alphabet its supposed to be the word of god written in fire i dont but billings if hitler didnt kill six million why is he your hero concentration camps all over europe and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand hes a putz where did you read this robert faurisson oh please yes well go to the country sometime okay read imein kampfi hitler had all his best ideas in prison then i wont bring you who am i who are you you schmucks you cant even make a decent swastika give me the paint give it to me what do you think youre doing youre a jew maybe you dont realize it but you are i dont care about money people still need values beliefs actually i think this moment has possibilities that you gave fifty thousand to that college magazine i have a job you got ta get out of here you eat first then you light once you light its yom kippur which means youre fasting so you canteat and be crushed nothing why are you doing this i thought god didnt exist shit did you talk to your mother today is it like eichmann are we goofing you cant do you know how many people ive brought intothe movement kaddish is the prayer for the dead you want a punch in the mouth believe me adolf hitler couldnt possibly have hated the jews as much as i do not in a billion years you know why the real nazis hitler goebbels they talked about jews incessantly you ever read their diaries nazis talk about it all the time what you think im jewish plus you have nothing else to do all day youre learning the hebrew really fast no i think you shouldnt you shouldnt dont curse in front of it no nothing follows you dont do it because its smart or stupid or it saves your soul youre not saved nobodys saved you do it because the torah tells you do you submit to the torah about doing things you light candles say prayers keep the sabbath visit the sick nothing but nothingnessjudaisms not about belief no difference vasitem vuvzayinchettet even though his dick is so big they dont put them in the torah ill get you a chumash theyll have them therebetgimeldalidhay how come youre here instead of with curtis besides the hebrew lessons its silent it holds a place takes a vowel the vowels are little dots that go under the letters good question both aleph you cant curse in front of it either see the jews love to separate things the holy from the profane milk from meat wool from linen the sabbath from the week the jew from the gentile as if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that yeah its stupid put it on or i wont teach you they think its the word of god and its holy and the flesh isnt put something on youre not supposed to be naked in front of it hebrews very difficult it would take years why and god said to avram take yourself away from your land and from the place you were born and from your fathers house into the land a different land and i will show you vayomer adonai el avram lech lecha mayartzcha oomimohladtcha oombayt avaycha el haertez asher arecha vayomer and he said it goes the other way what do you care no that was a later invention its not in the scrolls anyway the jews know where the sentences end they know the whole thing by heart every word every letter i stole it from a synagogue im coming to your room tonight your father when can i see you why wont you talk to me then how come youre talking to me oh really you werent complaining about my play last time yes i am basically i am you think people ever commit suicide out of happiness whats he care about is he a nazi are they still together how come so many of the books are in spanish iund die worte zerfielen mir im munde wie modrige pilzei you want it to be an event i just read it i work at the big boy warehouse in queens i drive a forklift at first no one will know why the victims are being killed abstraction theyre obsessed with abstraction the point is the modern world is a jewish disease too difficult have you read toynbee spengler why dont you come visit well have a rematch he called me up he wanted to talk to me about my ideas i didnt notice his shoes did your mother know he was there did you know that there was a inew york timesi reporter there that night i didnt realize you cared carla its me dannydanny balint we met at thatmeeting at your house im stealing it nothing lets go shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod whos eichmann ill go look ive been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil hitler how am i supposed to what aboutmanzetti the synagogues ive been waiting all my life for something like this a week or so theres something i want to do here first what about mrs moebius and its the truth theyre liars and cowards id have to research it study his routines his security but ideally on a new york street at midday using a smallcaliber automatic without a silencer totally the family emigrated from bulgaria when he was eleven isnt that what we want germany all over again only done right this time id say nothing after two or three people will try to find a pattern a reason no but deep down beneath the tolerance they learn on television nothings changed the very word makes their skin crawl it isnt even hate really its more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor we want to step on it crush it we dont even know why its a physical reaction everyone feels it people hate jews do you agree obviously get the fuck away from me if i tell you will you pull the story not write about me yeah and what are you a itimesi man a presbyterian impotent a prick you work for the inew york timesi your whole job in life is not to understand things like me i dont look stay out of what you dont understand what were you following me no yes infinitely more they would become as god its slander its reckless disregard ill sue you and your fucking jew paper to discredit me because i know who they are look i thought i explained it to you those people can say or do anything and they will its all narrative to them its are you going to print what this guy said listen to me do you know who youre fucking with here look at me do i look jewish look you believe that and you call yourself a reporter who how would i know him what excuse me youre kidding right differences exist of course but theyre irrelevant for the jew his jewishness dominates everything even the ones who renounce it who hate it who want to cut it out of their hearts a knifecant escape theyre still just jews notice the israelis a fundamentally secular society they no longer need judaism because they have soil the real jew is a wanderer a nomad he has no roots no attachments so he universalizes everything he cant hammer a nail plow a field he can only buy and sell invest capital manipulate markets he takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books ideas numbers this is his strength take the great jewish minds marx freud einstein what have they given us communism infantile sexuality and the atom bomb in a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of europe theyve taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare irrational urges and relativity a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt why because it is the deepest impulse of the jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread nothing but nothingness nothingness without end those arent jews deracinate tear out the roots a people a real people derives its genius from the land the sun the sea the soil this is how they know themselves but the jew doesnt have soil the jews clearly control the media and the banks investment banks not the commercial ones but the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality they undermine traditional life they deracinate society lets just say ive done due diligence youre not listening he isnt better he gives pleasure but thats actually a weakness real men white christian men we fuck a woman we make her come with our cocks but the jew doesnt like to penetrate and thrust he cant assert himself that directly so he resorts to perversions oral sex is technically a perversion you know that dont you after a woman has been with a jewish man she never wants a normal partner again a normal man because the jew is essentially female yes its very pleasurable but the jews are obsessed with it you know why and jewish men like to get it jewish girls like to give head right and what did you notice did you ever fuck one guy you ever fuck a jewish girl let me give you an example sexuality the jews are different blacks are disgusting and inferior but its like criticizing a retarded child the jews area poison in the human well german mine too so who do you thinks given more to the world the germans beethoven goethe nietzsche or the entire continent of africa ibos bantus mandingos what should i be a white inferior ist a multicultural zulu egalitarian let me ask where are your people from in the movement the racialist movement we believe theres a hierarchy of the races not just in iq but in the civilization the art the forms of government the civilizations that each race produces why are you writing this down if youre recording it i agree what about curtis zampf no yeah fine go ahead so whats this about is
