and in the spring cross the ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called cantuckee will you go back to england and my compliments to you listen submit you hear me youre strong you stay alive i will find you no matter how far how long it takes in this there is a chance if i live i can try to free you if we dont go there is no powder theres too many of them though my heart would keep me here in that there is no chance none i can do nothing do you understand maybe i dont know whatever happens you stay with your father you stay among the officers do not promise me webbs reinforcements will arrive or not if they do not arrive the fort will fall if that happens stay close to your father the french will protect the officer class among the english because what i am interested in is right here why i am looking at you miss miss may i top of this ridge fort and lake george are downhill of it sorry to disappoint you cos frontier lands the only land affordable to poor people so after seven years indentured service in virginia they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin by anothers leave their name was cameron john alexandria the bible monarchy many wrong ideas about the government of men my fathers people already know each man is his own nation and only he can have dominion over himself not kings no man is better than any other man my father sent uncas i to reverend wheelocks school when i was ten so we would know both worlds though we were told only bother learning readin arithmetic from yours i do not remember them i was one or two they buried my ma pa and my sisters and chingachgook who found me with two french trappers raised me up as his own in your particular case miss i would make some allowance the ottawa are gone yes and do not try to understand them that is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense yes he said do not try to make them understand you chingachgook he warned me about people like you well that is to be expected my father anyone lookin to pick up our trail would see it as a sign of our passing let us go miss only one or two loads you will have to forego the pleasure of hangin me then we take the south rim down the mountain and its 12 miles cross country to fort edward this is it as far as we can go if were lucky theyll be figurin we cant have come this way and mustve beached our canoes and headed cross land if were very lucky theyll figure we went over the falls we dont head for for the white water only chance we got is to get more distance on em and go to ground major some day i think you and i are gon na have a serious disagreement that is the truth and if english law can not be trusted maybe these people would do better makin a peace with the french ottawa do not let gratitude get in the way england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account she uses us to war against france on her own account of greed for land and furs i aint your scout and i am in no damn militia no headin west to cantuckee no came across the war party tracked em no blood vengeance no reproach or insult dark haired he is huron and nothing else why would he want to murder the girl day and a half where did you get the guide fort william henry your wounded should try walkin back to albany theyll never make a passage north nodo not call myself much of a subject at all you do what you want with your own scalp do not be tellin us what to do with ours and while they are cooped up in your fort what if the french send war parties to raid their homes first place you started it with the french over furtrapping claims to the head waters of the ohio now youre sayin these people have a fight on their hands i said france is your enemy not ours your enemy it does and it is a better lookin reason than you jack winthrop push hard cos you got to clear the french outpost by dawn good luck jack got a reason to stay ill cover them from the top of the casement out the northern sallyport strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the french picket line head north over the ridge then come about southeast and fork left in little meadow and youre free of the outpost and skirmishers folks here goin to join in that fight so what is it jack what brings you up here that we did john but the horicane is near trapped out would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man would the huron have greed for more land than a man can use like francais black robes do would huron kill tribes with disease would the huron fool seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads brandy but sell the fur to the white man for gold those are the ways of yengeese and les francais masters are they the ways of huron men who hunt work the land or of dogs maguas heart is twisted he would make himself into what twisted him a dog become master of dogs but are hurons dogs maguas way is false it is like the white sickness maguas way will bring only sadness and shame is there another way i dont know i am nathaniel of the yengeese hawkeye adopted son of chingachgook of the mohican people let the children of the dead munro go free i speak the truth magua would use the ways of les francais and the yengeese so the huron are the servants of the french to do what the french are shamed to do wise one the french fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship magua broke it it is false that the french would not be friends still to the huron let the children of the dead colonel munro go free and take the fire out of the english anger over the murder of their helpless ones easy for you to suppose while it is their women and children not yours alone in their farms that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms families major heyward was at john camerons he saw what it was many men here their homes are in the path it was a war party it means theyre on the attack up and down the frontier a man here can make a run straight through to webb help ourselves to a few horns from your powder storesthe men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake build fires and provide every comfort you desire alice absolutely are you alright yes miss my god youve grown up compliments mr poe take her and get out what the bloody hell plan is this you are defending him because youve become infatuated with him he knew the penalty for breaking regulations he ought to pay without sending you to beg munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests i see cora i adore you and when we come together we will be the happiest couple in england i am certain of that more than ever before i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts one called magua arrived it can be dangerous will you consider that cora in my heart i know once were joined well be the happiest couple in england let those whom you trust your father help settle whats best for you in view of your indecision why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine some isnt respect and friendship a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined and all else may grow in time aversion no hatred loathing and by sea any powder and if were unlucky then what i dont understand where do we go from here do you hear me sir if you ever fall into british hands what white water how long i ought to have you whipped from this fort that is sedition treason excuse me who were these people i owe you gratitude or id call you out then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia fort edward then then youre assigned to fort william henry of course not and how is it you were nearby miss cora munro he never set eyes on her before today what colonel munro sent him he was one of our mohawk allies how far is it scout we were headed by your leave sir sir might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munros daughters i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort i thought british policy is make the world england sir the crown negotiating the terms of service i didnt experience anything so surprising from bristol to albany as what i witnessed here today sir general webb can burn in hell well go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts our mission is to fight this is the signature of webb and i know the temper of our men rather than spend the war in a french prison hulk in hudson bay theyd fight to the end and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon englands policies in her own colonies to come and go without so much as a by your leave things were done nobody was spared yes sir webbs not in albany he marched the 33rd to fort edward two days ago might i enquire after the situation sir given that ive seen of the french engineering from the ridge above ambush on the george road this magua led us into it eighteen killed its these men who saved us they guided us here sir webb has no idea and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements fire men are to stay in file sergeant major thank you sergeant major thank the men sergeant major fire advance sergeant major fire sergeant form three ranks what is enough the king the king has mountains of gold yes gold could be arranged yes yes three four oxen much wampum if magua give women to yengeese soldiers will receive many gifts excuse me what did you say no stop in the glade just ahead when the ladies are rested we will proceed do you understand we must stop soon women are tired you understandmay the force be with you thats straight through the central core up toward the top of the city once youve got her avoid the main transports theyll shut down immediately your only chance is through the service shafts there are no sensors there all right now get going you dont have time i hope you can remember everything there is a greater risk in staying here you know if you dont find the princess then the whole trip was for nothing wasnt it its not good unless i could find the crystal then it could be very good darth vader is on this system i can feel him i can feel the kiber crystal and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan shielded compartments all right then well use your plan check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures both of you will have to learn you have your fathers style youve done very well fear is their greatest weapon lukes got a point fear is their greatest defense i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust and what there is is most likely directed toward largescale assault a million at least if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major youll be able to name the reward i think there are some things we should talk about well for one reason we dont have your other five thousand no not anymore we have to find he rebels what were carrying belongs to them well now you know the enemy is on the move we havent much time the empire must have gotten here first well well see im ben kenobi luke starkiller here is leading our expedition keep it with you always youll have more need of it than i it will bring the force to you youve already learned to feel it now you must learn to use it you go after the princess i am an old man and would be of little help i must try to find the crystal see once you let yourself go you can do it youll get it stop thinking and start feeling let yourself go try to feel it use the force i didnt say that but it appears to be a logical alternative but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases what is it all you have to do is lose your thinking self dont focus on anything let your body do your thinking you have to learn to act on what you feel not what you think if i had the crystal it would be much easier you could feel the force immediately but for now let yourself go youll pick it up and someday youll have no need for that pistol either i rarely use it any more i have the force the force is more powerful than any pistol you shouldnt put too much faith in that weapon work on becoming aware of the force learn to feel its presence within you try to sense what its telling you its the only thing you can rely on yes the force something horrible has happened i couldnt see what it was or where it was but it was terrible terrible beyond description the cry of millions dying at once keep away im fine im fine these are doubtful times the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the i doubt it it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding i know your feelings youd best forget them its for your own good there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan its the heart of the sith the bogan force is the most heavy there hes bluffing five maybe let me handle it there are two halves of the force of others one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it but the others half will kill you if you arent careful this negative side of the force is called the bogan which is where the expression came from and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents both halves are always present the force is on your right the bogan is on your left the kiber crystal can amplify either one the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi when he joined the sith the power of the dark lords was completed they use the bogan force yes it was a black day one of my disciples took the crystal and became a sith lord it was a black day the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan thats how theyve become so powerful i had one but it was taken at the battle of condawn when a creature dies the force it generated remains the force is all around us it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal its the only way to amplify the power of the force within you a jedis power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him and i have little of the force left in me luke im coming along to do what i can but im tired and im depending on you to get us through it means youd better get some rest well be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning the trip will be difficult and dangerous but its the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major now go on that is not a human decision not your or mine it surrounds you and radiates from you a jedi can feel it flowing from him from here lets just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with it is an energy field in oneself a power that controls ones acts yet obeys ones commands it is nothing yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes all living things generate this force field even you you were right it is my responsibility the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me not any more i already know you think youre worthless i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light for what you believe you are is what you become i havent been involved in anything like this for many years im afraid ive gotten too old for this sort of thing i know your intentions i probably know much more about you than you realize in many ways youre a lot like your father he was an indulgent man but a clever warrior now what brings you out here you could put it that way i know that i know who you are stand up so that we can talk properly youre embarrassing me im not that important i dont see why i dont believe weve ever met im afraid its been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars but i have the memories you might say im part of the landscape here they call me ben kenobi oh so youre a warrior then youre lucky those tuskens didnt boil you before they hung you out to dry theyre not the friendly sort youd best be moving on before they come back sorry but that was the only way to get you down all of them altogether you seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess what happened good morningwell be back before you are old man im not going out there dont look at me im just a pilot i got you here youve got to do the rest is that good or bad what do you want with our scanproof lockers ill get the information were going to get in by studying imperial procedures i dont like it were into the second perimeter theyll be coming out to blast us shortly i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in not bad im not afraid of anything kid you take the glory and the good intentions and ill take the reward this isnt a game you know anything i want now thats interesting how much do you think shes talking about im beginning not to like you whos going to pay me then im not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy i was only paid to get you here and now youre here ill take my other five thousand and youre on your own ill leave you on the nearest system their bases are very well hidden all the power of the empire cant find them do you know where they are well ive brought you here what now the planet has been totally blown away it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than ive ever seen if the empire had a new weapon that could do this i would have heard something id know about it you might get your stuff together well be coming up on organa major soon im han solo captain of this vessel whos in charge then what about us are we to wait forever is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star part of my reward is that i be around to spend it id like to get paid before that eventually i dont plan to stick around for the fireworks i dont see how were going to find anything out here this terrain is hopeless id better go see how hes doing where are you taking us now anyway whats that little droid carrying thats so blasted important then i think were due the reward you offered and it had better be substantial after what weve been through chewbacca its time we showed them this isnt the regulation f888 cargo trawler was this trip really necessary yes your highness ill let you open it then it wont be too long before they figure out what happened to us this has turned into a brilliant escape i noticed you were having some problems blue five i thought id help i know but the chances for survival here just arent great enough in my book ive got what i came for now ive got to get back to my ship well if its not well be facing that death star all by our lonesome i dont pick up any life form concentration down there shed better be right get to the ship move out of the way watch it move back no he smells something but we havent time to worry about it now not if this tunnel deadends lets try this way holy maker i think i did this isnt going to work good i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around youre good with remotes but how are you against something living dont you believe it no its impossible no one and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system im a free booter not revolutionary youre aboard the wrong ship son all right all right youve got a ship but where do we go from here they probably took her to find the hidden bases i dont see how we can find the rebels before she breaks the empire has already beat us out why i found it its just not there sorcery i believe in myself i determine my destiny not some mystical energy field id keep that thing close just in case if i were you ive been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side its automatic you got yourself a ship we can leave as soon as youre ready organa major is a rebel system there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ten thousandthe kiber crystal im not going alone what about the princess i dont get it but i guess i did block it i cant do it ill get hit i cant see how can i fight you mean we should go after her he cant find organa major what do i do are you sure you dont need it are you all right whats wrong whats happening but shes a member of the twelve families how can they hold her when we get artoos message to them you think theyll try to rescue the princess this is the last place shouldnt we just take what we can get and think of something else we dont have that kind of money how much do you think i can get for the speeder like bogan weather or bogan times i thought that was just a saying do the sith know the ways of the force thats where my father was killed dont you have a kiber crystal how can you store an energy field within you but youre still a powerful jedi you dont need my help what do you mean could i learn to feel it you mean i generate an energy field my father used to talk about the force of others but he never told me what it was but the sith lords are involved whatever information this r2 unit is carrying it must be awfully important theyre probably looking for him im no match for the sith this is a jedis work this is your responsibility but you must i cant do it alone im not at all like my father id never make it my father told me many stories about you he said if i was ever in trouble to come here i need your help i assure you my intentions werent bad you saw through me i im not a bendu officer im not even a startrooper but you are i know your diary of the clone wars by heart my father i am the son of annikin starkiller youre general kenobi the jedi knight the commander of the white legions who are you anyway of course im a bendu officer im luke starkiller guardian of the bendu couldnt we have tried to think of something else first what do you mean good morning do you mean that it is a good morning for you or do you wish me a good morning although it is obvious im not having one or do you find that mornings in general are good at least youre doing something id give anything to be in your position but you always said things were so great at the academy what happened but there was a lot of firing earlier you look great the uniform and everything yes sir but i can get him im right behind you blue leader ive got it blocked im all right yes sir yes sir i was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust ive also had six hours on the t2 yes sir thanks old buddy ill be with you in a second youre a good pilot ive learned a lot from you i wish you they must be shielded somehow im sure the base is there come back here where are you going its only light that doesnt affect it solid things like rocks can hurt it fire above him get chewbacca try to get around it ill draw it away is he afraid of the water i think shes going to be all right see threepio come in see threepio i wonder where they are see threepio something has happened to them lets try this way why didnt you say so before between his howling and your blasting everything in sight the entire city is going to know were here i dont know ive never fought anyone well i practice a lot maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us they probably dont think anyone would dare try maybe you should just drop us off im sure we can find someone willing to take the risk you cant weve come this far we must find them what are you saying you dont believe in the force whos the pilot we have a little business to take care of first but it shouldnt take long well be back shortly thats pretty steep wed like to talk it over first the ah doors jammed give us a few minutes to get it fixed no need everythings under control a wookiee broke loose up here but weve subdued him there is a lot of damage and three no four casualties i i dont know i guess i never thought about it i just want to help i want to be in on the attack i want my own ship are there medical facilities on yavin i am luke starkiller at your service youre safe weve come to get you out of here just relax you used my savings you stole my savings if my father were here but you promised ive saved enough money and now you have the extra help you promised i will but ill have enough time to transmit my application first id consider it an honor threepio shut down all garbage mashers on your level do you copy threepio shut down all garbage holy maker threepio i forgot see threepio do you copy good were right above you stand by are you safe youre back what happened never mind whats going on see threepio do you copy send feedback into the control sensors in that detention block let him have it youre winning anyway it doesnt make any difference well ask him tell him we need five thousand i think were going to need them blast it no youre not what kind of talk is that can you stand weve got to get out of here before those tuskens come back well i dont know what to do now well just have to head inland and see if we cant find a settlement according to my fathers tapes this is the spot where general kenobi lives but the instruments just dont match up with the landscape there is no doubt about it were lost tell me where youve been i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars my father was a jedi were you in many battles youve been in the counter wars against the empire theres a lot of carbon scoring here it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action thats all right there is nothing anyone can do about it you can call me luke not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead
