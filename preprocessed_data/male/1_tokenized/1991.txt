need some spin control youre right im sorry what is your boss is lying jennifer yes you could check itd be in his files swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered i want to know why he keeps that hidden hi i work for the city leave stephen out of this yeah and just how much of all this has been doing your job you could have scared the son of a bitch off we may never bust him now all for a couples political points bullshit you knew what i told you wasnt ready for the papers you told swayzak about our arson lead its all over the fucking news well our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment this area is the pumping panel which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose i wanted to be a good one when i came back i knew more than anything else that i wanted to be a fireman see that trap door up there that used to lead to the hay loft when they had horsedrawn engines it was pretty different then but kinda the same yknow this is one of the oldest fire stations in the city lotta tradition locked up in here what do you think oh there might be something stashed away for emergencies thanks for the invite in a dinosaur kinda way yeah jesus give him a break there isnt enough proof yet to go public sure we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch em and weve maybe figured out why backdrafts but you cant rush this stuff not till its locked no hes more of a dinosaur guys not a dummy though hes juggling alot of balls on this one okay well you did invite me here sorry are you dating anyone hey so are you dating your boss or what yeah well maybe i can fit it in i dont know im kinda swamped here boss and i are up to about three words an hour hey arson yeah ive been thinking about what you said the other night if the offers still on the table id like to talk about it hey sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss but im not gon na be a poster boy for him im trying to do something here theres five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day tell swayzak to talk to one of them so now you suddenly care about my future cmon jennifer hes just another northside jagoff with a mouth i seem to remember some pretty good nights on jp ii what was that oh man you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt yeah swayzak humanitys last hope how can you work for that guy carrying swayzaks notebook oooh very sophisticated having fun with grenadine right well if nothing else its nice to know we can still be friends really no kidding yeah what have you been up to so i see youre still in the neighborhood uh ive been sorta keeping a low profile the academy i graduated today you look great jennifer oh jesus christ who the fuck is doing this trychticholorate the outlets i wanted to be him right then i wanted to be him more than anything i i thought it was great i loved it it was nothing to these guys medium deal what i dont have a story then who whos doing this im close but i cant get who it is hey do i know you see you monday sir no it isnt out of your hands or you wouldnt even have met me if i push you have to let me back in dead hero father rule sir i need another one sir if you remember sir my test scores were in the top i want another shot sir if it was a joke sir youd be laughing like it never happened yeah so what do you want me to do just wondering did i say thanks did you pull me out how ya feeling then who wrote the report ive got three different drafts of the same report with different numbers thatre all over the place looks like they were just making it up as they went along yeah airtight nice bunch of guys so seagrave and holcomb were accountants hey boss dekom trust is owned by pan illinois which is majority controlled by lakeside dynamics which is a division of windy city ventures whos partners are alan seagrave donald cosgrove and jeffrey holcomb fire im finished with swayzak ill do whatever you want me to do i just want to help catch the guy that burned tim you got ta give me another shot are you going public with this thats why the sealant on the doors so what have we got a torch with a conscience what reason but he killed these guys what some people say you dont do much of anything when it comes to this case but the right guess on this is arson and the putty around the door trychticholorate then swayzak can announce seagrave was a murder during heat episodes of 2000 kelvin or higher trych breaks down and dissipates will consume magnesium trychtichlorate is a binary structured uh i dont think thats in my contract no it couldnt another backdraft glass what are you listening to where are you going i think we should get something straight here i was assigned to this office by the city get used to me inspector im not going anywhere uh im brian mccaffrey your new assistant oh man im sorry well thats two things to strangle stephen for where is he anyway sean come on out man what you forget your favorite uncle thats sean jeez hes a giant i know i know shoulda called ive been really busy i joined the fire department four months hi helen man you look great yeah in fact i just dropped off a letter to the times explaining how yesterdays arson announcement was a fabrication by your office they loved it and you know what you were right my family background in firefighting gave it weight nice boat yeah we got all kinds of traditions like dying young i have a job every little boys fantasy no you dont understand i saved a mannequin uh i think theres been a mistake i didnt save that woman yeah big fan swayzaks not my boss so you surviving without me what ah man is he usin that line now on you what you think he made that little gem up jesus christ i used to have to listen to my old man use that every morning do you have to do that backdraft lots of fires they promote faster there take a look at the last lts list half the guys on it came from that battalion got ta think about your future timmy 115s the station lucky guess and a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments engine 115 right completely out of control i was ahead of my time coffee sucked management were pin heads didnt offer the kinda growth and challenge i need its in my blood willyanother couple of good men get burned up for their city is that how its going to read youre the only one that knows your brother was a good man ive been lying here hours just thinking were close were not looking in the right place brian this one knows us and were not looking in the right place i hate hospitals youre so so goddamn useless no yeah well brian i guess you can say its arson now it had to be someone who knows numbers some kind of fancy accountant but whats the connection did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report they did exactly one job swayzaks manpower study its not even really a company no employees no directors just a po box this is the copy of swayzaks manning report that was released everybody on this job knows its bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers theyre all airtight who all ended up wearing candles for faces swayzaks up to his ass in this somehow guy can barely hold a drink in his hand hes so scared and cosgrove coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate they werent very high on seagrave either son of a bitch they knew each other in a word brian what is this job all about what the hell are you doing here no do that and i guarantee youll scare him off i dont want him running away no we have a stone killer trying to make a point why backdrafts whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire but also made sure the fire blew itself out but he could have killed everybody there the firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall the backdraft blew out the flame thats it thats the reason i got it after we talked to ronald torches want to fry the whole goddamn world but the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much the burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls and he made his burns backdrafts thats it oh that son of a bitch hes different goddamn it you see what this tells us huh our killer doesnt love fire i dont work for them either i dont guess even if it was used to seal the air off that doesnt explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft a guns a helluva lot easier look it isnt proof okay someone may have put the chemical in the outlet but we found it as a vapor in cosgroves clothes son of a bitch tears em apart just to eat the oxygen wouldnt take much at all to melt ten gauge wire problems burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace unless you could find something that would eat its residue ever burned magnesium its so hot it takes water molecules and bamm go to the bottom under heat properties read i just rewrote your contract cmere temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees but copper wire in outlet is melted which requires 5000 degrees an accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire glass found in ignition room is in small thin pieces indicating explosion lack of discoloration indicates a long slow burn explosion must of come after a slow burn you little tease what were you up to you little bastard huh what made you that mad or scared it started in this room took its time hung out but the air ran out it couldnt breathe so it was snuffed but it wasnt dead still all that trapped heat lying low waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air do we have a language barrier here glass so you were happy here warm and cozy and in no hurry soot high clean unburned wall low indicates slow burn in thermal balance find me some glass shhh pest control look i knew your father he had a helluva reputation on this job but that dont mean you get any slack swayzak sends you down here okay i got ta eat you thats the rules and i got nothing to say about that but swayzak or no you live with me step out of line and i dont care who knows you ill swing the hammer you think youre the first then go find a corner i dont want you in my way are you still here your dennis kid i work alone what the hell was it doing in the fire trychticholorate alright its an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents its pretty rare they stopped making it a couplea years ago

salt two sides to every coin why you keep dancing on my head for my man we been thickern molasses pie since law schoolmaybe i have a little more respect for this countrys institutions than you do susie you tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the mob the cia fbi and army intelligence and who knows what else when you know you cant even keep a secret in this room between 12 people we got leaks everywhere were going to trial here what the hell do we really got oswald ruby banister ferrie are dead shaw maybe hes an agent i dont know but as a covert operator in my book hes wide open for blackmail cause of his homosexuality grab your socks and pull clay bertrand is clay shaw susie youre an assistant da remember stick to what you can prove in court maybe theres more to this susie the cias keeping something from our enemies no im not frank i dont want to hear it yeah i guess you do boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew hey where yat frank youre wasting your time here big jim gave strict orders no fbi allowed keep saying what rumor is shaw a local boy was working on some arms deal to discredit the civil rights movement no one really knows what they were doing there but everyone sure saw em they stood out like cottonballs i got whites and blacks saw em but last time i checked there was nothing illegal with registering to vote we still got the negro junkie vernon bundy saw em talkin at the seawall near lake pontchartrain but its tough boss no one wants to talk about shaw hes yeah they were seen together in clinton in early september the civil rights movement was running a voter registration drive with whose testimony willie okeefe a male prostitute jack martini a drunk vernon bundy a dope fiend shaws got respect the newspaper editors the american bar association theyre not the fact is hes gone chief and sos our case its addressed to no one and no signature to leave this life is for me a sweet prospect i find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand everything that is loathsome you numa what do you think lou pretty fast wasnt it the way they let him go so why does he call himself bertrand clay bertrand is clay shaw the guy who used to run the international trade mart whats the other name who is he joe ive been to every bar no one wants to talk go on willie and thats where you met oswald for the first time did he pay you for this clay bertrand willie this is louisiana chief how the hell do you know who your daddy is cause your momma told you so youre way out there taking a crap in the wind boss and i for one aint going along on this one jim sighs saddened bill was one of his best men yeah maybe cause theres some rogue element in the government boss are you calling the president a murderer oh now youre saying lyndon johnson was involved the president of the united states so for those reasons youre going to trial against clay shaw chief well youre gon na lose we should be investigating all our mafia leads here in new orleans carlos marcello santos trafficante i can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the government rubys all mob knows oswald sets him up hoffa trafficante marcello they hire some guns and they do kennedy and maybe the government doesnt want to open up a whole can oworms there because it used the mob to get to castro yknow castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to john q citizen so they close the book on jfk it makes sense to me i dont buy it chief why would the fbi cover it up youre talking the whole fbi here a telex that disappears from every single fbi office in the country where you going boss found another note same thing no name no signature when you receive this i will be quite dead so no answer will be possible i offered you love all i got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth well they offered you the carrot and you turned it down you know whats coming next dont you boss thats fine numa but what about all the people who arent writing letters theyre sitting home reading all these lies i just heard nbc crews in town to do a white paper not on the kennedy killing but on us one of their top guys harry stoner is talking to everybody he can find about you boss thats gon na be tough nobodys talking i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this boss susies stuff is colorful but but why he had his palm print on the weapon and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief thats what youre saying im lost boss what are we saying here gee thanks boss and the six of us with almost no budget and in secret are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldnt solve we cant keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is chief hell never sign a statement boss let alone get on a witness stand well its a terrific yard chief but the mans an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss lord wake me please i must be dreaming what the hells a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banisters at 730 sunday morning its not exactly fresh blood were sniffing here boss the anonymous

do you think the agency gets people to do their bullshit fuck knows what they got on oswald everybody the agency the mob the cubans yeah follow the cubans check them out here in dallas miami check out a guy named eladio del valle my paymaster when i flew missions into cuba hes somewhere in miami youre on the right track you think i was a getaway pilot for the assassination dont you oh you got that banisters pet project getting paid by the government to work against the government beautiful what a mind he had what a guy guy he had all those files leons in a bad mood dont get excited hes all right why whats wrong yes now i remember mr garrison im sorry i got confused we got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized wed forgotten our shotguns stupid right so of course we didnt get any geese oh yes well come to think of it theyre right we got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them but you couldnt approach them they were a wise bunch of birds i believe the boys got a couple in the morning we went goose hunting then headed home but i dropped the boys off to see some relatives and i stayed in hammond no particular reason just to go somewhere we went straight to houston and then saturday night we drove to galveston and stayed over there oh it was just a spur of the moment thing the storm wasnt that bad i hadnt been there ice skating in many years and i had a couple of young friends with me and we decided we wanted to go ice skating yeah now thats true i drove to houston no i never saw him before in my life no if he did i dont remember him there were lots of kids in and out yknow thats not true i never met anybody named oswald anybody who told you that has to be crazy do you mind if i smoke mr garrison do you remember me mr garrison i met you on carondolet street right after your election i congratulated you remembergentlemen i will not hear this i value bill as much as anyone here we all need to make room for someone elses ideas lou especially me maybe oswald is what everyone says he is and im just plain dumb wrong william walter the night clerk on duty here in the fbi office gave me a copy of this it went all over the country nothing was done and the motorcade went ahead on schedule and this wasnt even mentioned in the warren report read it al well what do you expect from a pig but a grunt not one word thats an order i dont care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo numa its none of our business lets keep this side of it quiet shall we susie watch the language would you please the interesting thing is the extent to which the warren commission went to make him a communist they got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this mexico trip and the picture doesnt even match im beginning to think the point of the mexican episode was to lay the blame at castros door if oswald or someone purporting to be oswald had gotten into cuba come back then killed the president the american public once again wouldve screamed for a cuban invasion al you cant tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close goddamn sam if we dont start reading between the lines here yall got ta start thinking on a different level like the cia does were through the looking glass here white is black and black is white of course there werent cause they disappeared and yet the commission found you dean then how the hell did you get in the warren commission dean except through the phone records in the dallas jail did you speak to oswald in dallas recall any names so you saw oswald how many times and oswald did he pay what was his voice like street cats when did you first do business with this bertrand yeah she was pretty all right but not half as cute as you deano you shoulda tried a legitimate line of business now thats pretty important dean you also told the fbi when you met him he was six foot two then you tell the commission he was five foot eight how the hell did the man shrink like that dean you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this clay bertrand and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswalds layer because you keep conning me dean i read your testimony to the warren commission and julius caesar brutus and cassius they too are honorable men who killed caesar twenty twentyfive senators all it takes is one judas bill a few people on the inside pentagon cia with a fullblown conspiracy to cover it up yever read your shakespeare bill if im so far from the truth why is the fbi bugging our offices why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered why are federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before i know this bill lyndon johnson got 1 billion for his texas friends brown and root to dredge cam ranh bay for the military in vietnam thats just for openers i dont doubt their involvement bill but at a low level could the mob change the parade route bill or eliminate the protection for the president could the mob send oswald to russia and get him back could the mob get the fbi the cia and the dallas police to make a mess of the investigation could the mob appoint the warren commission to cover it up could the mob wreck the autopsy could the mob influence the national media to go to sleep and since when has the mob used anything but 38s for hits up close the mob wouldnt have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude assassins need payrolls orders times schedules this was a militarystyle ambush from start to finish a coup detat with lyndon johnson waiting in the wings shaws our toehold bill i dont know exactly what he is where he fits and i dont care i do know hes lying through his teeth and im not gon na let go of him theres a word orders i dont know bill i just dont know all right all right break it up jesus they mustve been hard pressed to come up with that one those bastards thats proof enough right there of what were up against the whole goddamn federal government bill oh jesus stoner why doesnt he call me i think we should have him in for a little talk can you get some sworn statements lets start making some assumptions about the man why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswalds this is not a thin trail gentlemen it is a very wide one who found the evidence who set him up lou bill susie i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of 63 see if its the same guy to frame him obviously you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think bill theyre not ordinary crooks it went to the goddamn fbi and they didnt find a goddamn thing it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he couldve taken off oswald at the morgue theres no chain of evidence bill and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser described by deputy weitzman maybe just maybe lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill a patsy take it at face value lou susie im going with my gut here hes got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle oh lee to rent the room right whats in a name right in intelligence theyre assumed to be fake a name is sort of like a postbox number a code several different people can use the same name right then why cant somebody be using oswalds name ill go you one better maybe oswald didnt even pull the trigger bill the nitrate test indicates he didnt even fire a rifle on november 22nd and on top of that they didnt even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day were saying that when oswald went to russia he was not a real defector that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died thats what were saying the murder of a president bill is a crime in orleans parish too i didnt pick you because of your legal skill you know when somethings rotten in the land bill it generally isnt just one fish well get corroboration find this clay bertrand if i were a betting man id give you 10 to 1 its an alias start checking around the quarter does that bother you bill i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute she has to have bad eyesight no youre awake bill and im dead serious and were going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day yever heard of a double agent bill im beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist after the arrest 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again now heres another one for you what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine old stains bill but just as telling morning boys ready for a walking tour hold your horses what kinda source well it doesnt make sense nick he was afraid of dying then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes can you ascertain if theres proloid in his system nick what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of proloid whats it look like nick get some rest dave and youll feel better in the morning well talk then dave its going to be okay just talk to us on the record and well protect you i guarantee it then who killed the president what about ruby and shaw dave can i just ask you this directly did you ever work for the cia did you take a good look at the tv when they had oswald was it the same oswald dave that was in dallas or was it an impersonator let me get this straight now clay shaw is blackmailing you i dont know were you who you scared of dave who was paying you dave you mean about the cubans getting trained north of the lake would you say this leon was actually lee harvey oswald dave i find your story simply not believable i see dave thank you for your time im sorry it has to end inconveniently for you but im going to have you detained for further questioning by the fbi your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car dave isnt it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun but the boys told us they didnt get any did you bag any geese on this trip and then sunday why galveston i see and where did you drive dave may i ask why the urge to go ice skating in texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory what was so appealing about houston well that mustve been mistaken information we got thanks for straightening it out for us there is one other matter thats come up dave we were told you took a trip to texas shortly after the assassination of friday im sure youve seen this perhaps you knew this man under another name but you are aware he served in your civil air patrol unit when he was a teenager how could i dave as you know president kennedy was assassinated on friday a man named lee harvey oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named jack ruby weve heard reports that oswald spent the summer in new orleans and weve been advised you knew oswald pretty well how could i forget you make quite a first impression sharon could you please bring us some coffee ive heard over the years youre quite a firstrate pilot dave legend has it you can get in and out of any field no matter how small im a bit of a pilot myself you know flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war come in dave have a seat make yourself comfortable coffee there were admirals but you took his orders he was directing the autopsy but you were a qualified pathologist was this army general a qualified pathologist your honor i would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question why did colonel finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck as a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death was it not colonel finck are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck theres nothing wrong with feeling a little scared jasper virginia telling the truth can be a scary thing it scared president kennedy but he was a brave man if you let yourself be too scared then you let the bad guys take over the country dont you and then everybody gets scared no jasper nobodys gon na kill us well it looks like it jasper hi freckle face thats something jasper what is it sure it is freckle face if i ever handled a minor felon like that itd be all over the papers id catch hell and this is the alleged murderer of the president i know no i dont think i am susie anyone else i think clinton is a breakthrough shaw denies he knows ferrie or oswald is that right it proves hes a liar keep on it bill i dont believe it goddamn they put oswald together from day one like some dummy corporation in the bahamas you just move him around a board sent him to russia in and out no passport problems you got the word microdots in his notebook you got the minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions the sealed diz201 personnel file for all we know there could be a dozen oswalds in different cities countries all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination does the real oswald know hes been put together who knows it doesnt matter does it hes a low level spy he doesnt know who he really works for i wonder about the williams just where did the first description of oswald come from at 1244 no one knows they claimed it was brennans but his description came after 1 pm who called somehow the fbis been tapping the williams and picks up a call between bell helicopter and janets phone an unidentified voice saying we both know whos responsible who called whys the bureau been tapping them presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at 125 an hour sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washingtons cabinet dammit it doesnt add up ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswalds return only intelligence people can come and go like that and marina does she have a problem getting out but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june 62 this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific he shouldve been prosecuted as a traitor dont get sidetracked how does he get back to the states thats the point does he have any problems makes sense hes a spokesman if we go to him our investigationll hit the front pages by sunrise blow up right in our face ruby was just given a new trial if he has something to say itll be there susie what did you find out on oswald ive spent half my life in the united states military serving and defending this great country mr shaw and youre the first person i ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president no people like you dont have to i guess people like you walk between the raindrops mr shaw have you ever been a contract agent with the central intelligence agency and that this company is linked to the schlumber tool company here in houma louisiana which is where their arms may have come from to david ferrie and his cubans it says that this company has heavily fascist ties to the french secret army organization that tried to assassinate de gaulle in 1960 mr shaw this is an italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the board of centro mondo commerciale in italy that this company was a creature of the cia for the transfer of funds in italy for illegal politicalespionage activities it says that this company was expelled from italy for those activities please answer the question mr shaw did you ever meet lee harvey oswald mr shaw can you identify this man no it was not do you know an attorney by the name of dean andrews does the name clay bertrand mean anything to you let me show you his picture and that the four of you partied early into the morning hours david ferrie in the course of that night mr okeefe said a man named david ferrie stopped by the house along with another young man after dinner you paid him to have sex with you i would imagine a uniformed waiter helps perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory mr okeefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter a colored man he particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other which he found rather unusual because the table was so long does that bring back memories of willie okeefe mr okeefe told us he met you at the masquerade bar down in the quarter and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on dauphine street do you recall that a willie okeefe a perry russo we recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you are you acquainted with a david logan well in an investigation were conducting your name has come up a number of times mrs mercer as a former fbi man its difficult to accept this but you didnt seem nearly so sure in your statement to the warren commission you mean you identified him on saturday the day before ruby shot oswald in the sheriffs report mrs mercer it says you were at dealey plaza two hours before the assassination but that he won and they killed robert kennedy they shot him down they killed him honey i never doubted for a second that i was will you come to the trial elizabeth well so do i goddammit so do i i had a life too yknow i had a life too but you just cant bury your head in the sand like some ostrich goddammit elizabeth its not just about you and your well being and your two cars and your kitchen and your tv and im jes fine honey while our kids grow up into a shithole of lies well im not fine about that im angry my life is fucked liz and yours is too and if you dont want to support me i can understand that but dont you go start making threats of taking the children away thats not why im attacking him you dont believe me all this time you never believed me of course ive changed my eyes have opened and once theyre open believe me what used to look normal seems insane and now king dont you think this has something to do with that cant you see damn it if i say ill spend more time with him ill spend more time with him i cant fight you and the world too liz i promise ill make more time for jasper ill take them up to my mothers if itll make you feel better spend a week ill change the locks the phone lines ill even get a bodyguard all right elizabeth get a hold of yourself honey come on the government wants you to be scared they want everybody to be scared to speak out they count on it but theres nothing to be scared of get a hold of yourself only cowards make crank calls sweetheart nothing is going to happen just a crank making phone calls happens a dozen times a day at the office honey some crackpot martin luther king was killed in memphis today what nothing is going to happen to you i wont let it dont be nothing to be scared about honey i been through four years of war this is nothing did they live its going to get worse honey i dont know what to tell them how bout the truth im doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wont be an arcane vanished idea they read about in history books like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of atlantis i dont know what to say except im sorry i just dont have rabbits on my mind liz im really sorry the meeting went much longer than expected tough day look ill rush and be there by two i promise go ahead without me im sorry but its important clay shaw is important im sorry because when i scheduled it i didnt realize it was a holiday you were there why didnt you say something no i told you i was going to talk to shaw you know i dont like these tribal rituals freckle face im interviewing clay shaw this morning itll be off the record honey ill bring him in on a sunday a quiet little chat between gentlemen goddammit i been sleeping for three years liz do i have to spell it out for you lee oswald was no ordinary soldier that was no accident he was in russia he was probably in military intelligence thats why he was trained in russian and then this colonel tries to make it sound like nothing oswald did badly on the test he says he only had two more russian words right than wrong ha thats like me saying touchdown here is not very intelligent because i beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess honey in all my years in the service i never knew a single man who was given a russian test oswald was a radar operator hed have about as much use for russian as a cat has for pajamas its incredible honey the whole thing a lieutenant colonel testifies that lee oswald was given a russian language exam as part of his marine training only a few months before he defects to the soviet union a russian exam oh she did huh when i come up ill show you how saturday night got invented i cant believe a man as intelligent as earl warren ever read whats in those volumes mmmmm sure smells good but egghead do you realize oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination with no lawyer present and nobody recorded a word of it i cant believe it a police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that oswald said would be inadmissible in court no ones trying to buy you willie its important to know why youre telling us this you realize the things youre saying willie are going to be attacked by a lot of different people willie are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal under the supervision of a doctor anything else unusual about him youd be able to describe in a court of law willie for sexual purposes i want to thank you mr okeefe for this time i will not have any damned ultimatums put to me lou ill accept your resignation are you giving me an ultimatum lou maybe you didnt hear what i said i will not tolerate this infighting among the staff i warn you that we need him back maybe we should just call it a day lou go home while were still a little behind we got two people killed maybe more we never thought about head of the cia since 53 kennedy fired them both cabell was his deputy for nine years talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop now well have to subpoena them lou his boss was the one on the warren commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community general charles cabell deputy director of the cia fired by kennedy in 61 because of the bay of pigs fiasco he moved back to the pentagon called kennedy a traitor when he came to new orleans to address the foreign policy association you know who introduced him our friend clay shaw earle cabell and guess who his brother is you know who the mayor was who do you think changed the parade route how many men why not just shoot kennedy coming up houston theres plenty of time hes out in the open a frontal shot the zapruder film is the proof they didnt count on lou we got ta get our hands on it didnt hoover say something about that the leaves had fallen off in november between six and seven seconds i took it once for a low thyroid condition it raises the metabolism lou did david ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism i have a plane to catch going to washington an interesting lead says hes closely connected to these events but he wont come down here i know what youre going through with ferrie lou well talk tomorrow goddamn sam i know you do lou im doing three more lectures this month youre all doing an incredible job sue al numa but this is one where if you dont nail the other guy youre dead how did jack ruby dies so quick of what cancer right a history of nazi germany lou they were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30s we learned a lot more than you think from the nazis read this our biological warfare lab is in fort detrick maryland close to where the national cancer institute is located think about it think the unthinkable question everything unless he or someone else wants him to get caught maybe he never ordered the weapon lou somebody else did it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswalds time sheet shows him clocked in at his job lou come alive these things are not adding up can we find her we need to find more witnesses lou hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young i cant say that comes as a surprise anymore were going back into the case lou the murder of the president i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas talk to some people bill i want you to get oser on the medical the autopsy susan on oswald and ruby histories tax records bill lou were standing in the heart of the united states governments intelligence community in new orleans thats the fbi there the cia secret service oni doesnt this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time upstairs in 1963 that was the office of naval intelligence and just by coincidence banister before he was fbi was oni what do they say take a look across the street lou you were in the marines who would be running that training remember whose office this was back in 63 531 lafayette street i know david a strange character lets get outta here lou i saw too much stuff like this in the war oh no how bad whats wrong lou russell honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire i just cant believe the chief justice of the united states would put his name on something that wasnt true you think there were other men involved russell you know something always bothered me about that from day one and i cant put my finger on it i thought the fbi testfired the rifle to make sure it could be done i sometimes feel thingsve gone downhill since john kennedy was killed senator sure they do the camera can pick this up thats exactly my question jerry maybe id better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what i am talking about well if i am why is the government concealing evidence your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching jerry it indicates that the age of innocence is not yet over but seriously jerry people arent interested in jim garrison they want the hard evidence they want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to ive been called everything under the sun jerry call me whatever you like just think just think what happened to our country to the world because of that murder vietnam racial conflict breakdown of law drugs thought control guilt assassinations secret government fear of the frontier some story the whole thing its like it never happened his name ever ask him and your general any chance of one of them confessing someday just speculating i guess how do you think it started well thanks for coming i havent yet i dont have much of a case the size of this is beyond me testify i dont i cant believe it they killed him because he wanted to change things in our time in our country ive already been warned by the agency mr whoever if this is another type of threat i dont well i just hope it was worth my while mr yes nobody knows what were talking about jack hold on jack whats the problem the assassination jack clay bertrand hes in the warren report he tried to get oswald a lawyer was kennedy ever discussed jack bertrand clay bertrand anyone else involved at banisters level anything more specific jack its important and oswald where is banister in all this was he there often why did guy beat you jack you have other information well id ask guy we were friendly you know heart attack wasnt it how much more yet on november 22 1963 the day of the presidents murder our police report says he pistolwhipped you with a 357 magnum but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill here take a look at it now does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you and he never hit you before heres my problem jack you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time its a means to an end this war has two fronts in the court of law we hope against the odds to nail clay shaw on a conspiracy charge in the court of public opinion it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out but at least were going to strike the first blow i dont think so al you remember the hemingway story the old man and the sea the old fisherman manages to catch this great fish a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in but by the time he reached shore the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton hell never make it if he wins theyll kill him he wants to avenge his brother hell stop that war no theyll kill him before they let him become president i expected that two months ago and theyre wasting their time the bad news is the national guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years well maybe thats good news it was never as good as combat but this is bill any more on oswald and shaw i just dont want to do it what else no she could get hurt if you believe whats happening to these other people okay you handle it numa i dont have time for this nonsense weve obviously got the bastards worried now im going to washington you just need some sleep lou it wont look so bad when even your own wife numa any of you want to quit do me a favor put us out of our misery its a contradiction numa get used to them the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets or fake secrets how long do you think it would take me to be appointed and what would i have to do the job manages to keep me pretty busy thats it less than you would guess most days two to three assistant das a handful of police investigators if you must know virtually nothing i imagine because this is the criminal district court building this is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence we germany theyve been enlarged and show a lot of detail we can use all the support we can get i think these might interest you yes your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there welcome mr miller jim garrison would you care for some coffeeyoure not digging you know you keep saying that not unless we go for shaw now pretty flowery for dave ferrie im just an investigator bill i leave the theories to you lawyers correct me if im wrong i thought we were on the same side what the hell business is it of theirs to say that what about the mob dave how do they figure in this what do you mean did we involve you dave or did clay shaw dave i always play square no bugs id love you to go on the record but im in no hurry whenever youre ready listen dave why dont we order some room service have a bite relax ill stay as long as you want yeah hed kill for you dave he likes you your mind yeah come on dave come on our side i guarantee you the bossll protect you dave dave just calm down meet me in the lobby of the fontainbleau in 20 minutes ill have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name dave you know thats where this road leads what did they what are you talking about dave you werent mentioned in the story dont jump to conclusions calm down dave what dave do you think were out of our minds the whole buildings been a zoo since that broke we cant get a thing done reporters crawling everywhere you think we want that dave you sure got it youre one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch da and youre making one hell of a mistake well if thats what you want to call it i didnt ever think it would come to this i guess i am boss boss then im afraid i cant continue working with bill i just plain dont trust him anymore chief ive had my doubts about bill for a long time hes fighting everything you never got anyone killed boss their actions killed them years before if we stopped now itd be even more wrong theyre gon na love you chief allen dulles the warren commission call him who no beats me city officials secret service dallas police they did a dry run with chief curry a few days before but they didnt bother running through dealey they stopped right there said something like and afterwards theres only the freeway and went home one shooter one spotter on a radio maybe three teams id say these were professional riflemen chief serious people hunters patient it takes skill to kill with a rifle thats why theres been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years 321 green or else abort abort when kennedy gets to the kill zone its a turkey shoot that means we got ta subpoena time life on it it was a texas live oak boss it sheds its leaves the first week of march you try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13dollar sucker the worlds worst shoulder weapon no way the fbi tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match oswalds performance not one and oswald was at best a medium shot the scope was defective on it too i mean this is the whole essence of the case to me the guy couldnt do the shooting nobody could and they sold this lemon to the american public the key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other and it takes a minimum 23 seconds to recycle this thing the other problem is there was a tree right there blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the zapruder film time id say the opposite hypertension im onto ferries cuban paymaster eladio del valle in miami i got ta get him in boss i need more men i cant even pull the teams to watch ferrie this is our case you dont get it guys he cant go down any further we got to protect him full time and it aint pretty the ad has spent more than 8000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since november 1966 mobbed up all the way tight with the dallas cops im digging chief i just need 10 more men and some more dollars i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced graveyard dead near big sandy texas in 65 two in the morning on some highway a hit and run there was rose cheramie a whore two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas graveyard dead august this year a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian texas the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died not a single frayed collar or cuff new haircuts fresh shaves clean hands new shoe leather look at the ear of the cop thats a wire whats a cop wearing a headset for i think theyre actors chief theyre not cops take a good look chief do any of em look like the hoboes you remember a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published they took em to the sheriffs office not the police station and they let em go no record of them ever being questioned what are you driving at boss once oni always oni post office the office of naval intelligence id say he was probably getting intelligence training yeah guy banister exfbi man he died couple years ago hes been in trouble before used to be a hot shot pilot for eastern airlines but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14year old boy one little guy with a cheap rifle look what he can do no word yet but they think its in the head boss the presidents been shot in dallas five minutes agodo you walk home and you get of from school at 3 every day and how tall are you i need some information from you then how old are you virginia youre a lucky little girl your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest would you like to be in a beauty contest virginia or elizabeth hello is this jim garrisons daughteryou know what i mean i saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer and a lotta strange people goddammit chief why would i ever need to look in your files i saw enough here this summer to write a book you may not like this chief but youre beginning to act paranoid i mean you really are chief sometimes i dont know whether youre kidding or not i think ill cut out here chief i got ta get home chief maybe you had a little too much to drink gods sake chief the president was shot youre so naive mister whats the problem whats the problem do i need to spell it out for you mr garrison i better go never not with me sir never listen i think id better go i said enough i said all im going to say sure course they hated the sonofabitch but yeah thats it i dont know maybe it wasnt i got ta go clay something that was his name clay there was one guy i dont know big guy business guy white hair i saw him come into the office once he looked out of place yknow like a society guy cant remember his name oswald was with him yeah he was there too sometimes hed be meeting with banister with the door shut other times hed be shooting the bull with ferrie but he was there all right like i said a fuckin nuthouse banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain ferrie handled a lot of the training there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba a few americans got trained too nazi types mercenaries but ferrie was the craziest often he practically lived there it was real cloak and dagger stuff they called it operation mongoose the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba banisters office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas through new orleans to miami stockpiling arms and explosives dave ferrie you know about him well i guess now that guys dead it dont really matter it was about the people hanging around the office that summer i wasnt really part of the operation you know i was handling the privateeye work for guy when that came in not much did but thats why i was there it was a nuthouse there were all these cubans coming and going they all looked alike to me i didnt say that all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out if you buy what you read in the paper i dont know if i should talk about this never touched me more than ten yearsno i did not no i would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures ive been shown no i did not no i did not now just a minute sir youre way out of line may i go regardless of what you may think of me mr garrison i am a patriot first and foremost and if i was mr garrison do you think i would be here today talking to somebody like you mr garrison youre reaching i am an international businessman the trade mart which i founded is americas commercial pipeline to latin america i trade everywhere i am accused as are all businessmen of all things i somehow go about my business make money help society the best i can and try to promote free trade in this world nonsense what next im well aware of this asinine article and i am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper of course not such a pity that assassination in fact i admired president kennedy a man with true panache and a wife with impeccable taste you really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters dont you mr garrison naturally are you claiming mr garrison that mr oswald also had dinner with me one meets so many attorneys in my business no i dont believe i know dean andrews clay bertrand clay bertrand i believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the chamber of commerce is that the man you had in mind no im sure ive never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance no i have never known anyone by that name of course never having met mr okeefe i could hardly have met mr ferrie who pffft absolute nonsense the quarter is filled with vivid imaginations my dear mr garrison grimy young hoodlums wholl say and do anything as you well know it adds a taste of elegance for which i must confess a weakness for now and then i call him smedley his real name is frankie jenkins but i could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering frankie where is this leading to mr garrison not at all but on the other hand i do have a lovely chippendale dining table and i often have a friend over sitting at one end while i sit at the other that is precisely the point of a long dining table the splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it no i dont believe i know anyone by that name no no never heard of him i wouldnt imagine where im not sure i understandbooboo the commission dont decide how i spend my honeymoon we have a commission if theres a dispute over territory the commission decides were gon na be the winning side its like rothstein said about that guy in austria were gon na use maranzano and masseria let em knock each other bloody and then when everybodys screamin for peace we step in to make it what theyre fight in over everybody will beg us to take mr costello handles our business with the government agencies a hundredseven bucks too much any kid who drops an extra dime is gon na be talkin to moliari is there a fuckin point comin up anytime soon whats your problem tommy reina we can get the war started tomorrow but it wont be pretty tommy reinas gone over to maranzano but so far masseria aint lifted a finger

question pity theyre retiring us just as i was starting to understand you spock thank you nurse jim shes ready lock and load spock that was actually funny bet you wish youd stood in bed fascinating im going to perform surgery on a torpedo you never know i believe the operation is over im going too they may need a doctor and the good news is theyre not going to prosecute absolutely not damned clever if you ask me are you crazy if theyre even looking for us that cunning little vulcan jim leave me im finished what kind of creature is this last night you two were spooning more than ever what is it with you anyway well if youve got any bright ideas nows the time to well dont be too hard on yourself we all felt exactly the same specifically of are we playing multiple choice that was the general idea i intended to convey kobayashi maru speak for yourself one day one night three months till retirement what a way to finish suppose hes holding a grudge figures whats the brotherhood of aliens chancellor gorkon can you hear me chancellor jim i dont even know his anatomy sweet jesus hes lost a lot of whatever this stuff is what the hells going on uh jim they dont arrest people for having feelings too bad we cant smell her this is fun now theres a poser starfleets killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of exploration and perhaps with a large step or two like a peace treaty i tried to save him i was desperate to save him he was the last best hope in the universe for real peace i was nervous i didnt have the knowledge of klingon anatomy i needed barely retire for 27 years i have been ships surgeon and later chief medical officer aboard the uss enterprise in three months im due to stand down aside from a touch of arthritis id say pretty good then let me help are you carrying a surgeon i dont wonder stop me if im wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you thats a comfort what are you in for if you dont mind me asking i dont believe we can get more out of the way than thisthe chancellor herself will testify that the defendants hands shook you were incompetent whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine you say you are due for retirement may i ask do your hands shake have you saved patients as barely alive as he was was chancellor gorkon alive when you first examined him ah i believe you also consumed romulan ale at the officers mess on the night of question doctor stand doctor mccoy what is your current medical status we were until your torpedoes your honors the state rests so if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination captain kirk are you aware that under federation law the captain of a starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men you deny that your men beamed aboard kronos one and shot the chancellor you deny enterprise fired on kronos one and you were obeying or disobeying orders the night you arranged the assassination of chancellor gorkon for insubordination you were demoted louder please we can not hear you spoken by you are those your words that either as an instrument of federation policy or acting on your own drunken initiative you and your fellow conspirators crippled kronos one and coldbloodedly assassinated the chancellor of the high council then you and doctor mccoy went aboard to make certain the job was complete and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair captain james tiberius kirk i put it to you captain that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son and what did they tell you did you have occasion to refer to your ships data banks during that night and you still maintain your ship did not fire on kronos one would you have known if she had come now captain the record clearly there were no other ships in the sector isnt it a fact that you served romulan ale a beverage illegal in the federation because of its overwhelming potency take them away under article 184 of interstellar law i place you both under arrest you are charged with assassinating the chancellor of the high council how can i trust you crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit and two starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this we have witnesses you feign ignorance to be or not to be that is the question which preoccupies our people captain kirk we need breathing room very much ive always wanted to meet you captainto be time we got underway ourselves gentlemen once again weve saved civilization as we know it come on killed trying to escape its a classic she didnt need our help getting anywhere where did she get these convenient clothes and dont tell me that flare is standard prison issue spocks looking for us once were beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away its the viridium patch spock slapped on my back right before we went aboard gorkons ship no way you see this dont remind me still think were finished uh uh somebody felt much worse and im starting to understand why no more neutral zone i was used to hating klingons thats why i failed in our assignment it never even occurred to me to take gorkon at his word spock was right some people are afraid of the future of what might happen i was frightened really frightened i didnt mean this future bones are you afraid of the future were not finished bones why dont you see what you can do let them know were not holding a grudge weve been set up all along thanks no can you i wish i knew uhura you heard the order lieutenant as captain i am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command i am i can not confirm or deny actions which i did not witness well i i have on occasion disobeyed orders yes those words were spoken by me yes yes that isnt true that we fired two photon torpedoes but i checked the data banks yes there were no other ships in the sector the drink was served what he just tried to save him hes a doctor what happened my god what happened here i beg your pardon would you care to go topside im not sure how to take that second star to the right and straight on till morning mr chekov slow down take us forward thrusters only one quarter impulse power mr chekov take us forward thrusters only one half impulse power shields battle stations then all weve got is a neutron radiation surge and by the time were close enough to record it were ashes shes here somewhere shes only a cog in the wheel no way she knows that who else first rule of assassination always kill the assassins torpedo bay did we fire those torpedoes uhura monitor i know what you mean full diplomatic courtesy mr chekov captain sulu on assignment anyone seen spock we must do this again soon starfleets been charting and cataloging planetary atmospheres all vessels are equipped with chemical analytic sensors chancellor may i present commander spock whom i believe you know dr leonard mccoy chief medical officer montgomery scott chief engineer well make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours uh would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard enterprise with my officers as guests of the united federation of planets chancellor weve been ordered to escort you through federation space to your meeting place on earth not me idiot him what took you so long isnt it about time you became something else your friends are late an accident wasnt good enough ive heard of chameloids shapeshifters i thought you were mythical candidate for what possibly where do we come in except us theres got ta be a way out of this place anything else you want to tell me how much times left of your sentence we didnt kill gorkon how did you know fraid not it wouldnt fit him anyway hes got it who else stand down mr scott all stop thats an order stand down your weapons energize you hear that starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a court martial on this ship lieutenant win lose or draw it will be on your record who is us uhura signal our surrender mr chekov anything unusual saavik you know anything about a neutron energy surge i hope youre happy uhura hailing frequencies right standard rudder bring us alongside only dont try putting words in my mouth you piloted well out of spacedock lieutenant right come on saavik you could knock im still in the chair lieutenant plot a course for kronos lieutenant thank you lieutenant one quarter impulse power as you were lieutenant thank you captain sulu when does this conference start im telling you hang on how many of those things are there come on lieutenant youre charged with murder im afraid we may need more than that theres a bird of prey on the lookout for us and she can fire while shes cloaked bless you sulu wheres the peace conference theyre going to attempt another assassination you understand that by even talking to us youre violating regulations captain sulu the only way to find out if a mans trustworthy gorkon thought the undiscovered country might mean something else another kin of life people can be very frightened of change i know i was but we havent run out of history just yet your father quoted hamlet he called the future the undiscovered country whats she waiting for make ourselves a target close enough to beam down spock you want to know something not for the actions of another no one is responsible for any actions but his own human beings someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter s you havent outlived your usefulness to me and you are not responsible just because she is also vulcan gorkon had to die before i understood how prejudiced i was you couldnt have known she was listening the night i dictated that entry into my log you were proud of her achievements as a vulcan i was blind i couldnt see past the death of my son i couldnt trust the night is young anyway it was logical you know youre a great one for logic im a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread were both extremists reality is probably somewhere in between us are you dining on worms why would they give them to us what peace conference so thats it he was just about to explain the whole damn im going you are going to be responsible for getting me out of this meantime were not going to be the instigators of a fullscale war on the eve of universal peace we havent fired what the from enterprise where spock im really tired what is it im going to sleep it off let me know if theres some other way we can screw up tonight far be it for me to dispute my first officer starfleet has always never been this close congratulations lieutenant that must make you very proud let them die dont trust them dont believe them i know your fathers the vulcan ambassador for heavens sake but you know how i feel about this theyre animals how could you vouch for me thats arrogant presumption we volunteered you have personally me not from a distance she wont show up on any type of scan uhura who else im going aboard spock you have the conn we surrender this is the starship enterprise captain james kirk commanding control this is enterprise requesting permission to departthis is incredible aye sir captain if maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed aye aye sir could take weeks sir they youre talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction mr spock a bird of prey canna fire when shes cloaked if another ship had been beneath us the klingons wouldve seen her not from us they dinna fire on themselves and there were no other ships present twentyfour hours from now we wont have a clue where the captain is they dont place the same value on life that we do spock you know that take my word she didnt shed one bloody tear and if theyre still in place that could take hours you can check the torpedoes visually if you like a computer canna lie sir its as i said mr spock inventory still registers every torpedo no way at least we must keep track of where they are taken sir i or not to be we were beginning to hit our stride together doctor calm yourself doctor the operation is almost complete we do sleep lying down vulcans sleep lying down you may need assistance doctor the charge is murder good luck captain you must have cursed yourself for having programmed our data banks lieutenant only they revealed something wrong aboard enterprise quite right mr chekov what is now required is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the captain and doctor mccoy freeze to death now we expand our search to include uniforms this is the first evidence that corroborates our theory klingon blood you tell them lieutenant youre forgetting something the data banks say we fired if we did the killers are here if we didnt whoever altered the data banks is here either way what were searching for is here theyre preparing to fire is to trust him i always assumed hamlet meant death probably trying to figure out why were reversing wondering if we detect her captain perhaps were going about this the wrong way our job is to get to the conference her job will be to stop us not yet section 4236 but i am not human i am only i should have been can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness would that constitute a joke i was prejuduced by those achievements i too was blind i knew about her and i did nothing i trusted too much you were right it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation you might have died the commander is an old friend of yours ive been dead before uhura raise excelsior she ought to have the coordinates azetbur has agreed to meet the federation at a undisclosed location to continue her fathers work the conspirators obviously intend to try again the peace conference the klingons have a new weapon a bird of prey that can fire while cloaked she torpedoed gorkons ship captain perhaps youre right i am responsible for involving you in this i will go according to the data bank we have twice weve fired on the chancellors ship curiously it appears to emanate from us we are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation i am uncertain i dont believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy i believe the captain feels that starfleets mission has always been one of peace the chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal lieutenant i am pleased to see you the lieutenant is the first vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class as the academy theyre dying jim there is an historic opportunity here i was asked by my father to open neg theres an old vulcan proverb only nixon could go to china i have personally vouched for you in this matter captain we have volunteered to rendezvous with the klingon ship thats bringing chancellor gorkon here and escort him safely through federation space perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night lieutenant there were things i tried to tell you too about having faith but it was when you tried to persuade me the captain was guilty that i should have understood i believe you please if you are logical an error im having the garbage searched if my surmise is correct these boots will cling to the killers necks like tiberian bats they couldnt make their escape without them nor can they simply throw them out a window for all to see no theyre here somewhere even logic must give way to physics gravity hadnt been restored by the time they escaped without their boots they would not have stayed on the klingon transporter pads any progress an omission after that very well for twentyfour hours well agree that this conversation did not take place curious you havent been assisting commander uhura with her radio transmissions have you lt any reply from starfleet to our dispatch lieutenant her own father in the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight according to our data banks this ship fired those torpedoes what do you suggest lieutenant opening fire wont retrieve the captain and an armed engagement was precisely what he wished to avoid that the universe will unfold as it should you must have faith i am not certain such speculations are included among your duties lieutenant you have done well saavik as your sponsor at the academy i have followed your career with satisfaction and as a vulcan theyre outside the beaming shield mr scott start your engines thank you mr scott we were to return to spacedock the killers would surely manage to dispose of their incriminating footwear i believe i am this one can would they too far off very near us perhaps underneath us there was an enormous neutron energy surge i know precisely where hell be thats hardly conclusive mr scott as klingons have no tear ducts then someone forged a data bank entry nevertheless well have to check every one of them mr scott i think not yet the data banks insist we fired twice one computer is lying mr scott you forget yourself please accompany me ive already addressed that question mr scott well e able to follow the captains movements but you didnt join a conspiracy under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship we call it plasma i do not know the klingon name for it but by any name it is merely ionized gas i dont think starfleet could have envisioned our current predicament at present hes surrounded by a magnetic shield if my calculations are correct he should be deep into his escape planning by this time mr scott any progress on repairing our warp drive i want this ship searched from bow to stern lieutenant saavik you are in charge start with the transporter room and work your way outwards and theyd be right we have no evidence just a theory that happens to fit the facts it means that if we can not have fired those torpedoes then someone else did an ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth hes placing himself in a most awkward position i assume command of this ship as of 0130 hours uhura send to starfleet hq explain precisely what has taken place and request instructions theyre naturally wary maam weve been at war a long timehow do you know i took it how do you know they didnt just give it to me now that you mention it they might have been a little bit jumpy you might say we had a meeting of the minds yes umm yes she was driving alright she did good didnt she aw god whos the nut youre a little angle you are i may be the outlaw but youre the one stealin my heart ive always

to make a difference to do what i thought you were going to join us jesus garland you left me alone with those people but charlie  why me why  i hear its mundt madman mundt youll be back its more than ive got sure charlie yeah but charlie  i just dont know what to do charlie i feel like im going crazy  like im losing my mind i dont know what to do i didnt do it believe me im sure of that charlie i just charlie ive got no one else here youre the only person i know in los angeles jesus charlie i jesus youre leaving uhhuh wheres audrey they got ta believe me charlie they got ta have mercy but i didnt do it  dont you believe me i dont know maybe it was her boyfriend i passed out i dont know wont the police be able to  yeah we got ta call the police  i dont know i woke up she was god you got ta believe me i didnt do this i did not do this you got ta believe me  ive got ta call the police  or you could call for me  will you stay with me till they get here charlie im in trouble  something horribles happened  ive got ta call the police charlie im in trouble youve got ta help me no can i come in no no no im fine thank you dont pick up and leave without saying goodbye well i guess you pick your poison what do you mean well i guess the heats sweating off the wallpaper im truly sorry to hear that charlie ill miss you youre leaving and theres hope for you too charlie tomorrow i bet you sell a halfdozen policies where theres life theres hope yeah but  how did you know about that well its been better i cant seem to get going on this thing that one idea the one that lets you get started  i still havent gotten it maybe i only had one idea in me  my play maybe once that was done i was done being a writer christ i feel like a fraud sitting here staring at this paper well its its a defense mechanism well my pleasure i could use a little lift myself seems like nothing but lately yeah as a matter of fact they did come on in hi charlie its okay its okay yeah okay thats all right really  nope never watched any im not that interested in the act itself  probably sounds a little grand coming from someone whos writing a wrestling picture for wallace beery yeah this must be boring you you know in a way i envy you charlie your daily routine  you know whats expected you know the drill my job is to plumb the depths so to speak dredge something up from inside something honest theres no road map for that territory sure thats tough but in a sense were all alone in this world arent we charlie im often surrounded by family and friends but my folks live in brooklyn with my uncle no i guess its something about my work i get so worked up over it i dont know i dont really have a lot of attention left over so it would be a little unfair nope no i guess youre stuck with the one youve got have a seat seen a doctor yeah come in charlie hadnt really gotten started yet  what happened to your ear charlie how are you see you charlie sure sure charlie you can help by just being yourself well weve got something in common then youre all right charlie im glad you stopped by im sorry if  well i know i sometimes run on frequently played seldom remarked sure you could and yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live from where they trade from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and so naturally their work suffers and regresses into empty formalism and  well im spouting off again but to put it in your language the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill exactly charlie you understand what im saying  a lot more than some of these literary types because youre a real man well i dont mean to get up on my high horse but why shouldnt we look at ourselves up there who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and  and  and who killed nigel grinchgibbons and thats the point that we all have stories the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king its the stuff of life  why shouldnt it be the stuff of theater goddamnit why should that be a hard pill to swallow dont call it new theater charlie call it real theater call it our theater i dont guess this means much to you yeah i guess it is but in a way thats exactly the point theres a few people in new york  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience create a theater for the masses thats based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesnt hold true today if they ever did well thats a good question strange as it may seem charlie i guess i write about people like you the average working stiff the common man what do i write about thats okay charlie im a playwright my showsve only played new york last one got a hell of a writeup in the herald i guess thats why they wanted me here thats okay actually i am just starting out in the movies  though i was pretty well

have felt this way when you first met anne huh where did you two meet holdin my penis is that what your girlfriend does for you happily married probably maybe when we get the grail i cant ask for heri have to earn her then lets begin with the story itself its a story of the grail mythand although there are several variations my favorite begins with the fisher king as a young boy who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage and during that night he is visited by a sacred vision out of the fire appears the holy grail gods highest symbol of divine grace and a voice says to the boy you shall be the guardian of the grail that it may heal the hearts of menbut the boy was overcome innocent and foolish he was blinded by greater visions a life ahead filled with beauty and glory hope and powertears filled his eyes as he sensed his own invincibility a boys tears of naive wonder and inspiration and in this state ofradical amazementhe felt for a brief moment not like a boy but like god and so he reached into the fire to take the grail and the grail vanished and the boy hands were left caught in the flamesleaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him when he became king he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the grail but with each year that passed with each campaign he fought the grail remained lost and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse he became a bitter man life for him lost its reason with each disappointment with each betrayal with each loss this wound would grow soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starveduntil finally the king lost all faith in gods existance and in mans valuehe lost his ability to love or be loved and he was so sick with experience that he started to die as the years went on his bravest knights would search for the grail that would heal their king and make them the most respected and valued men in the land but to no avail pretty soon finding the grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the kings power which only confirmed the kings worst suspicions of man causing his wound to grow his only hope he thought was death then one day a fool was brought in to the king to cheer him he was a simpleminded man not particularly skilledor admired he tells the king some jokessing him some songs but the king feels even worsefinally the fool says what is it that hurts you so much how can i helpand the king says i need a sip of water to cool my throatso the fool takes a cup from the bedstand fills it with water and hands it to the kingsuddenly the king feels a lot better and when he looks to his hands he sees that it was the holy grail the fool handed himan ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all alongand the king asks how can this behow could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find and the fool answers i dont know i only knew you were thirsty and for the first time since he was a boy the king felt more than a man not because he was touched by gods glorybut rather by the compassion of a fool are there any questions bingo who are you talking to jack come on try it ya feel the air on your

why george you big softie im supposed to fall for that employer the president three minutes twentythree seconds if you think im doing another to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion you centrally intelligent scumsicle but im not the type of guy to hold a grudge bastard youre going to need another nose dont i know younot necessarily a wife would then its authority is in doubt what an extraordinary request another one yes the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague its an escape route dont get stuck a cenotaph a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere but look i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day and i found this in a manner of speaking what made you think id be able to get you into the castle there is one thing id like you to tell me im flattered of course to be considered a friend even without knowing all the details to see such determination is reward enough for me a man must eat and drink success or nothing why do you work in that hideous insurance office dealing with people who fall off ladders now take me i make my living as a stone mason its not my art but its the tools of my art you could be a journalist where do you get your ideas only joking im just joking lets go to a brothel then kafka come on these strange stories you write they come naturally do they in what sense the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man very good i read the one about the penal colony just what youve published ive read your stories theyre fantasticthe orlac claim no theres only one report to complete ill be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow was there something else i do you might find a more athletic hobby put some color in your cheeks i understand you fancy yourself an author yes raban but he was too much like you even more so perhaps he wasnt here as long as you so i didnt know him as well but i could see the influence he was having i simply want you to be aware of this because youll be happier for it oh i know you got along with that poor fellow what was his name attitude kafka it doesnt matter how well you do your work you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in have you never wondered and i mention this only in passing why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you who have been here longer have not its not healthy kafka not for you and not for your workmates at the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance you must make the time where do you go off to in the lunch hour you keep too much to yourself youre a lone wolf it makes me uneasy and if it makes me uneasy i cant imagine the impression you make on lesser employees youve been with the firm for nearly nine years youve done your work diligently there are no complaints on that score but theres more to the job than the work there are other people to consider and frankly kafka we eel your social situation could bear improving sit down kafkawhat did she say thats been noted but where does it lead us unless you have something more to add thats not what i call conclusive evidence of an abduction should you happen upon anything that might be relevant anyway id like you to reflect that in me you have i wont say a friend because were complete fencers of course from distinctly incompatible social classes but to some extent shall we say an interested third party what makes you think so we know that his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to he might have had a drink or two despite what you think grown men dont normally fall into the river do they was he depressed he was found in the river could he swim would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close engaged in the manufacture and distribution of pills and so forth where youve been employed for seven years your office is the workmens did you go anywhere afterwards to have a drink perhaps when was the last time you saw mr raban kafka is that your real namea glorified office block they keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living its only majestic from here when you get closer you see it for what it really is up there you have been hearing the sordid side then even the socalled new town isnt so new only the people people of the future living in buildings of the past has anyone seen eduard what was the matter with it have you worked here long you look like brothers my assistants i presume a true friend would do it its my last and final one if i dont see you later go to my house and find my notebooks and destroy them all my manuscripts just burn them please will you do me a favor then you appreciate my writing not a chance im the thinnest person i know an empty tomb the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else wasnt it part of the castle originally i always assumed thered be a gate or something isnt there im trying to find things out myself thats the whole point oh yes determination runs in the family the kafka men are famous for it you know delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter picking up sacks of flour with their teeth the castle cemetery you work in the cemetery no not even success my writing is not for making a living its for living not for other people its for me that would be even worse it would be a compromise i havent got the energy i mean i have to conserve my energy naturally thats not the word i would have chosen gabriela was right its easier for me to understand suicide im a practicing suicide did you in magazines nobody reads i dont know what you could have read yes ill commit that to memory your credibility yes its well known burgel i thought it would be easier as long as i was passing he has it he just hasnt noticed it yet all right ive never seen him i dont believe there is a keeper of the files no i left it in his office i gave it to him yesterday sorry yes well thank you sir i see its just the erlanger claim then no i just i feel a sense of obligation he was my friend if i can be of any help closing his affairs i wonder if i might look to see if theres an address for family i thought id like to write to them excuse me sir i understand you have eduard rabans file in a small way eduard well i no sir i did not realize it was obligatory i usually take lunch by the river to do my work well i have little time for my social situation you wanted to see me sir listen to me no not this time i told you theyre dead its finished theres a new potion he said it was perfected theyre dead now we can get help i i found your jailer gabriela ive just come from the castle its over gabriela you did get away now burgels one of the authorities first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil now its insignificant burgel if indeed there was a mistake and a minor one at that youre suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all usually ive heard of it happening now youre saying eduard was lured there hes jealous yes but that jealous hes too cautious burgel doesnt like anybody that street down there i always used to call it the approach road for suicides it leads straight down to the bridge and the river now youve fallen into his trap when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him you dont believe that it couldnt be for that incident with burgel the other day why were you given notice burgel gave me this what does it mean at the cost of others you accuse people of murder without trial apparently without irony did you go to the castle with eduard then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all even before or after he got there my only concern is the human tribunal isnt it yours people must think the same of me a quiet dependable person i have no right to be i know my experience with real life is practically nil and you still maintain what that he was murdered what of it ive hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from ah were back to the authorities you spoke of i dont know the musil district and you last year i it was broken off all right tonight what could he have done to warrant that when i have no reason to doubt he wasnt robbed he was identified by his wallet the police would know the difference wouldnt they no i dont im amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all how long were you and eduard this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving that he was satisfied in that regard i didnt want to pry i suspected that he well no well nice to know life exists outside the office ive never seen you here before im sorry but i just wondered oh well i thought he once mentioned youre a friend of eduard rabans im kafka i work upstairs in accident that the police may have allegiance to something other than truth maybe its true then what she said shes missing i went to her house and she hadnt returned there you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up gabriela is relevant when i spoke to you before i didnt know shed been seeing eduard if someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away wouldnt they have shut the door as quietly as possible but thats just my point she was more than upset she was livid she slammed every door on her way downstairs except that one i was just behind her and i didnt even hear that one shut not at all ill bear that in mind probably not just a perception he wasnt a lonely man though i dont think he really had any he had no family either can i ask how you found me no i suppose not no he didnt seem to be do you think he drowned himself i dont know yes since he came to the office almost three years ago weve been quite good friends how was eduard well other departments are yes eight and seven months accident and compensation association no we said goodbye outside the building he went off as usual toward his house wednesday we left the office together yes yes of course why wouldnt it be my assistants i should have known nothing is given to me i have to acquire everything close only by virtue of antithesis its a farce for all your incompetence i was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me youre very good ham actors you should meet my father whats the matter with you you mean youve actually begun some i didnt realize youd been here that long do you oh burgel gabriela was having an affair with eduard they were both members of this group if any crimes been discovered and people are paying for it id look to yourselves then why havent i been you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful if the discrepancy really was something big eduards responsibility would still have to be small no poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix thats mad why take me into your confidence what have you done with gabriela rossmann the fact that its live bodies you practice your trade on doesnt seem to matter to you lying in the gutter where they belong and i suppose dr murnau didnt die in a cavein you killed him to free the position of orlac medical officer for your own ends i had the grandest of financial plots in mind the most malevolent of personal motives conspiracy theories extending to every authority i could see and i find you a body snatcher accident and compensation no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being a piece of paper a piece of paper i could always apply there where do our records go to in the castle what if i petitioned one of the directors what good are records if theyre not open for public inspection once a files been sent to the caste is it possible to recall it for review this is the crossreference of clerks whove worked on orlac claims i did read that they gave him a posthumous medal all these in the last year orlac is an account you mean my chief has it its gone out so quickly whats the matter hes the clerk who died last week from the insurance department yes isnt it there it usually isit so happens my dear simple sir that the head of medical records at the castle is one of the directors of this firm were a medical firm arent we they go to the medical records section you do not summon them they summon you and this of course hardly ever happens if at all the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious these laws have been with us for centuries how can you doubt them of course not only by a director of the firm whod want to let in all kinds of riffraff off the streets is your friends name among them then he only worked on the one case your chief will send me the final summation when hes finished with it dr murnau was the bravest of men he spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain a great loss you must have read about it in the papers there was a terrible cavein it wouldnt have been so bad but even the medical officer for the district was killed its a factory in the northern mountains one of our best customers without a proper request im not obliged to do this you understand but ill make an exception on this one occasion if it was accounts you wanted why did you ask for employees whenever an employee departs shall we say its up to the head of his department to requisition his file reassign any outstanding claims and send it off why would we keep files on dead employees all old files are sent up to the castle do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records wait a minute raban where have i heard that name im overworked as it is raban did you say im not obliged to give you access you know not without authorization but ill make an exception this one time raban thatll be nearly at the back of the alphabetstarling youve earned back your place in the academy we never wouldve found him without you and nobodys ever going to forget that least of all me no starling there isnt time and youve still got crucial work to do in ohio we want him for murder not kidnapping im counting on you to link him to the bimmel girl before hes indicted take a bow customs had some paper on his alias they stopped a carton two years ago at lax live caterpillars from surinam the addressee was john grant calumet power lights given us two possible residences under that alias were hitting one chicago swats taking the other this gumbs a real beauty slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric where starling he took vocational rehab and learned a useful trade johns hopkins finally came up with a name for us we fed him into known offenders and he came up cherries subjects name is jamie gumb aka john grant lecters description was accurate he just lied about the name starling we know who he is and where he is were on our way now starling with id and a gun impersonating a federal agent is a felony im bureau for 28 years starling i wont disobey orders not even now ohio is cold ground picked over ten months ago our people worked it so did the locals you heard them i dont have that authority anymore theyll use their best men but they better be paying attention good idea meantime try to get a feel for catherine martin her apartment her friends how he mightve stalked her im going to the other two clinics minnesota and ohio nows the hardest part starling use your anger dont let it keep you from thinking just keep your eyes on catherine weve got less than 30 hours or just as worthless but i want you in memphis close to him maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin hell talk to you again theres a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip im 53 starling if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv id still have to retire in two years its not a consideration but you are youve done enough if i keep you out of school any longer youll be recycled cost you six months at least i can guarantee you readmission here but thats about it nows your chance starling go back to class leave bill to me lets get some coffee and talk she doesnt know what were up to and we cant afford to let her find out state to federal jurisdiction we can do it eventually but well never get all the clearances in time can you convince him a deals already in place what would it take if we act too anxious hell make us wait hell let the senator keep hoping day after day until catherine finally washes up thatd be the most fun of all he offered to help starling not to snitch that wouldnt give him enough chance to show off remember lecter looks mainly for fun never forget fun but for catherine martin it all comes down to you and lecter youre the one he talks to you seem pretty sure of that the other girls are in the ground exhumations are upsetting for the families ill do it if i have to but when we get back i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian see if they can identify it maybe its got some limited range or it only breeds at certain times of year you found it starling you deserve the credit point taken when i told that sheriff we shouldnt talk in front of a woman that really burned you didnt it that was just smoke starling i had to get rid of him you did well in there they werent there get closeups what do you see starling are you finished what should i say you did fine work well wait on the lab okay starling lets have it maybe youve got a knack for this i guess were about to find out why not why talk about him starling tell me what you see good idea but he thought of it too weve run simulations using different vectors and the best dates we can assign you put it all in the computer and smoke comes out no this one is different this one has seen us coming blue square for belvedere ohio where the bimmel girl was abducted blue triangle where her body was found down here in missouri same marks for the other four girls in different colors this new one today washed up here elk river in west virginia about six miles below us 79 real boonies you dont have to feel any way about it lecter did it to amuse himself why not what can they do take away his books for awhile and no jello i know it got ugly today but this is your report starling take it as far as you can on your own time outside of class now carry on the orderly heard lecter whispering to him all afternoon and miggs crying they found him at bed check hed swallowed his own tongue chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit and hes trying to blame it on you i told the little prick your conduct was flawless starling miggs has been murdered then do that starling do just exactly that do you recall my instructions to you starling what were they well why arent you there right now he mentioned a name at the very end mofet any followup on her every word starling every gesture ive read your interim memo on lecter you sure youve left nothing out be very careful with hannibal lecter dr chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him do not deviate from them for any reason you tell him nothing personal starling believe me you dont want hannibal lecter inside your head just do your job but never forget what he is now i want your full attention starling are you listening to me youre qualified and available and frankly i cant spare a real agent right now the psychiatrist dr hannibal lecter you see the one we want most refuses to cooperate i want you to go after him again today in the asylum were trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody for a psychobehavioral profile could be a big help in unsolved cases most of them have been happy to talk to us they have a compulsion to boast these people do you spook easily starling a jobs come up and i thought about you not really a job more of an interesting errand walk me to my car starling your instructors tell me youre doing well top quarter of the class starling clarice m good morning would you doctor that would be so kind oh thats clever dr danielson very humorous you like the truth try this he kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off we dont want him to do that anymore if you dont help me just as fast as you can then the justice department is going to ask publicly for a court order well ask twice a day just in time for the morning and evening news and each one of our press conferences will focus on dr danielson over at johns hopkins and how were still hoping for his cooperation and every time theres any news on the case when catherine martin floats when the next one floats and the next one why well just issue another press release about good ol dr danielson over at johns hopkins complete with all his humorous fucking remarks look search your own records if you prefer you can do it a lot faster than us anyway if we find buffalo bill through your information ill suppress it nobody has to know this hospital cooperated her name is kimberly jane emberg she was just idd i met her on a slab in west virginia and sometime tomorrow or tomorrow night hes going to do the same thing to catherine martin you want to see a violation this is a violation dr danielson the man we want was never your patient it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence please doctor time is eating us up just show me the ones youve turned awaygoodbye clarice you looked so very lovely today in your blue suit i have no plans to call on you clarice the world being more interesting with you in it be sure you extend me the same courtesy your lambs are still for now clarice but not forever youll have to earn it again and again this blessed silence because its the

precisely we begin by coveting what we see every day dont you feel eyes moving over your body clarice i hardly see how you couldnt and dont your eyes move over the things you want no he covets thats his nature and how do we begin to covet clarice do we seek out things to covet make an effort to answer what is the first and principal thing he does what need does he serve by killing no thats

clomping about in my life oh dear no at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own how did you feel when you saw him clarice may i call you clarice who can say best thing for him really his therapy was going nowhere his real name is benjamin raspail a former patient of mine whose romantic attachments ran to shall we say the exotic i didnt kill him merely tucked him away very much as i found him in that ridiculous car in his own garage after hes missed three appointments youd have him under missing person which in poor raspails case could hardly be more true i might if i saw the case file you could get that for me why dont you ask me about buffalo bill your bleeding has stopped advancement of course go to split city see miss mofet an old patient of mine mofet now go go i dont think miggs could manage again so soon even if he is crazy do you no but i will make you happy ill give you a chance for what you love most clarice starling i would not have had that happen

bill such a naughty boy did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him no no no you were doing fine youd been courteous and receptive to courtesy youd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs and now this hamhanded segue into your questionnaire it wont do its stupid and boring memory officer starling is what i have instead of view yes thats the duomo seen from the belvedere do you know florence i have no doubt of it its much better than your shoes i see i myself can not you use evyan skin cream and sometimes you wear lair du temps but not today you brought your best bag

trainee to me that expires in one week youre not real fbi are you may i see your credentials we being the behavioral science unit at quantico youre one of jack crawfords i expect oh and senator love

to confirm it previously in order for it to be reconfirmed she talks a great deal and smiles a lot shes very pretty she has a real good figure shes very girlish or womanish if you know what i mean she wouldnt hurt anybody this girl she couldnt the new girl is here here comes daddy thats the least of her troubles rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up she told me all about it rose says shes goin to have a baby and she sure looks it but i dont think so sense doesnt mean anything to rose but i think were on safe ground now daddy chained up the ladder whoever it is cant get in the house doll dont ask childish questions mother is struggling desperately in fact shes fighting like a tiger but i dont know its close its mighty close theyve been in there the longest kind of time i cant stand it i got ta find out whats going on dumbness doesnt concern her doll and neither does smartness you see it isnt that she hasnt got any sense doll her basic intelligence is probably above average maybe quite a bit above average so am i chattanooga i had st louis missouri shut up doll ill cut your guts wonderful he kissed her and played with her titty and i dont see anything so great about that he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him you shouldnt watch such things doll shes putting the titty back let me look awwrr is that all what are they doing doll what are they doing now i cant see what are they doing hes trying to get up good god one of her titties is out this is my place and you cant have it theyre discussing it at least lets go peep from the living room there goes mother yeah its really pitiful shes in bad shape no he doesnt not really its pitiful neither one of them know daddy says rose is calm as lettuce do you believe that doll rose is almost as sentimental as mother if theres one thing i cant stand its sentimentality in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder he killed his wife with a black widow spiderno she hasnt i think i hear a car shes got somebody in there brother his shoes are on the back porch there they were naked and smiling at me rose open this door immediately open that door damn you and theres only one reason anybody would want this ladder to get up into roses bedroom in the dark of night i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it and that is not all i am going to do see son the paint is flaked off here freshly look at it brother there is no question about it some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder true but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder now lets go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with well well what i mean is you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him but look this brother it is even more interesting look at this mark here and that mark over there now wouldnt you say those marks are the marks of a ladder that is because it rained recently the rain has obscured the evidence but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are and that way you could catch him understand see that son now this is a heel see and there thats the ball of a foot someone has been walking here hes not coming back again we scared the rascal off son come on back to supper your mother has a theory about how to educate rose what do you think brother whats taking the rascal so long is that doctor still up there brother the girl strikes like a cobra i never saw anything like it how did she pick him up so fast son was rose in your room last night reading dirty comic bocks and you admitted it you were up late last night brother now look boy get a grip on yourself rose had a good life she found her right didnt she she triumphed over everything what are you blubbering about nobody lives forever boy whod want to its true son the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead she is no more i know you loved her so did i it was an awful shock to me too an awful shock rose was so alive its hard to believe she was fiftysix son of course she didnt look

you doctor for your discourse it was fascinating no doubt honey he is mr right well thank god we are rid of her at last and the best thing of all is that shes happy the little nut is happy she found mr right in the nick of time you know dave his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died why that looks like dave wilkie im afraid its my fault i made her feel guilty this morning brother what are you doing up its twenty after one fine well i know more so thats why i was thinking maybe shed be better off well i i hadnt thought about it that much i was thinking well its an idea the girl is oversexed and well now darlin give me a chance to defend myself reluctantly i do it would be a blessing to her and everyone else the girl is oversexed and i say spay her honey thats no way to talk to the doctor hes merely doing his job dear i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition i wash my hands or the whole thing she doesnt have to take her panties off we can see her stomach with em on all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly i forgot that rose will lie like a child shes no more pregnant than i am she just doesnt want to go to that farm ah ha hold the phone no forwarding address huh in the shock of this brilliant move i forgot something she already told you she doesnt know youre not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning the problem is what are we going to do this is a total catastrastroke as of this moment i am stumped i admit i am stumped and treed both the hound dogs have me surrounded trickery and flummery or not shes going there

talked to him on the phone a fine man its not a farm damn it its a beautiful dairy establishment stop crying rose do you hear me stop crying its ideal something has got to be done or rose is going to

hell we cant it has been three weeks since i fired her is there no way to get rid of this girl are we stuck with her for life just a moment dear we cant have it rose can you behave yourself or not

coil shuffling question if you cant behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs hillyer and i mean it i point my rigid finger right at your nose rose and i stare unwaveringly

i youll have to admit she had four husbands i dont want to start no fight with you buddy why do you say im full of shit she didnt marry him though later she married another guy and went to winstonsalem it didnt last that girl couldnt have no lastin marriage she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west little bitch left him too and you know what shes married to right now a kike thats right some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle whos got the nerve to have the same first name i got wouldnt you know it rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike she was always out of her friggin head and ill tell you why buddy she was sick in her mind and between her legs too she was a nymphomaniac shes te reason cured me of women once and for all oh i got rid of her buddy i didnt waste no time kickin that bitch out hell she was screwin everybody in savannah i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin piss out of him doubted my ability all along the little bitch i never remarried buddy you know that dont you thats correct outside it not in it as for the job well the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they aint worth a sorryass damn but i can build anything buddy give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon its a fact i can build anything but she never believed that oh hell no she never believed in me near alexandria it isnt in alexandria it is outside it took your time gettin here hey girl hey you give us another drink dumb little bitch supposed to give us two in the first place heh heh heh heh same old buddy always jokin around almost as much of a joker as your daddy i saw your daddy a coupla years ago i was up in glenville lookin at a motel site i guess thats where youre headed huh to see him i dont mean that the way it sounds imagine it a book and i used to know you personal way back when tell me something buddy how do you dream up all that stuff how about that well you always were a screwball galley what ha ha course you make a lot more whats that you got there buddy oh its all right beats jew york but the niggers have took it over just like every other city we got only worse well i am in the construction business buddy and without braggin i have done real good at it there are those who wouldnt have expected that out of me right now im buildin a giant motel unit near alexandria outside washington dc not finance im on the construction side its dave wilkie im dave wilkie dont you remember me awwwrr buddy come on you know mei think we both know her i have of course observed the girl in treating her then may i speak quite frankly with you mr hillyer first about the girls history evidently shes been very promiscuous since early childhood she has no control over her sexual impulses furthermore she is permanently barren she cant have children oh its definitely better beyond question a fatherless child an ignorant girl with no job no money no home its fortunate a blessing really and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you any major operation is dangerous however as we know from her previous illness shes a very strong girl the point is you dont grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits she got protein somewhere shes a very strong girl and i think shell live despite the delay in medical treatment actually of course i wont operate i dont do major surgery dr hardy will operate and of course hell be guided by your wishes in this respect yes i understand you but you have misunderstood me completely illusions madam mrs hillyer this girl is sick in more ways than one she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me i am thinking particularly of the other ovary as a rule i dont believe in removing it the womans hormonal system is profoundly disturbed she is subject to possibly serious depression she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example her breasts might shrink and become flabby facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished especially in a girl or young woman for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary as a rule do you follow me im sorry the truth nauseates you mrs hillyer because before you leave theres a bit more of it id like to put to you this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well shes an adult mrs hillyer i was merely giving her the facts we make our own lives madam as for malignancy i dont think so its very unlikely i probably shouldnt have even mentioned that possibility to her dont worry madam she cant infect your dear little kiddies she long ago fully recovered but the disease did irreparable damage the girl is permanently barren im not surprised you thought she was pregnant an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy but it was pure wishful thinking on her part the girl can never have children she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated let me be the judge of that madam i beg your pardon epizootics do you mean epizooottics an animal epidemic its simply that i find it incredible mr hillyer aside from the girls illness at the moment she is very strong a very healthy specimen of a young human female and a comely one too she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child if only sporadically exactly and thats why she couldnt possibly have come from such a farm a tenant farm are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt afraid of the hospital of course she does and i must say im puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill well mrs hillyer the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive but not many people walk away from double pneumonia madam not manyim not blubbering thats a hell of a thing to say why rose why rose why rose daddy i cant believe it daddy i know it must be true but i cant believe it well you have knocked me for a hell of a loop old man a hell of a loop excuse me ill be right back but but how she was young rose wasnt old dead rose is dead you mean she died all right daddy we have our drink were out on the patio you have prepared me for it roses cancer has come back hasnt it its funny you would mention rose i was thinking about her all the way up in the car or maybe it isnt so funny it always gives me a funny feeling to come home dear old southland gone its all gone daddy except you youre still here thats what she would say herself you know i dont know this town any more all this traffic new buildings prosperity where have the years gone daddy where is the little town i knew as a boy he didnt lose her he threw her away youre damn right it incensed me the miserable bastard he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington dc the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac is her husband sick or something what sad news did her cancer come back whats all this about rose what do you mean you heard from her in a manner of speaking dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane her first husband its funny you would mention rose did you hear from her of course i recall rose in fact ive been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half good god the way you live here this place hasnt been dusted since mother died look at that goddamned refrigerator yeah theyre in the snow i can use a drink after the plane ride i had it isnt yankee whisky daddy its scotch hello daddy how are you what do you want me to tell her dave dave i havent seen rose for years yeah ill do that dave yeah i remember it yeah it took her a while to grow up and find mr right but she did it she found him dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life dave you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail go right ahead but i am telling you you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs well no i didnt actually umm well i see outside it tell me
