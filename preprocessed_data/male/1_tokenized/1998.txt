this beer you want one how about some ether i want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney hes not just some dingbat i found on the strip hes a foreigner i think hes probably samoan but it doesnt matter does it are you prejudiced dont take any guff from those swine remember if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the right people ridiculous just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and i picked you up you never saw me before shit this town is full of white cadillac convertibles i plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate you ready never missed a plane yet we had abused every rule that vegas lived by burning the locals abusing the tourists terrifying the help the only chance now i felt was the possibility that wed gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it her eyes were turgid with fear but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level i was stupid with shock not knowing whether to run or start laughing there was nothing in the atmosphere of the north star to put me on my guard yeh this foreign made crap is sucking our dollar balance dry inspector rock will pay you in cash a thousand dollars on the ninth of every month do you think you can handle it so do we lady finish the fucking story what happened what about the glands yes right extract of pineal why not we should get some of that just eat a big handful and see what happens i could already feel the stuff working on me the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine maybe i should take a swim i thought jesus what kind of monster client have you picked up this time theres only one source for this stuff the adrenaline gland from a living human body whered you get this i remember slumping on the bed his performance had given me a bad jolt for a moment i thought his mind had snapped that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies but the room was quiet again i remember thinking jesus what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid adrenochrome what is this its gone too far me lucy is looking for you theyll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs we keep it quiet its not the kind of thing youd want to talk about upstairs not with the press around whats wrong with you hell somebody has to do it they were all veterans like big lizards what could they do the guy that took the head was about sixseven and maybe threehundred pounds he was packing two lugers and the others had m16s just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a mcdonalds hamburger stand she was a waitress about sixteen years old with a lot of people watching too man you dont know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice right sure as hell some dopedealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that youre partying with a thousand cops dont mention that word around here youll get them excited theyre actually nice people when you get to know them maybe we should take it easy tonight thats good you cant be subtle in this town i felt like a nazi but it had to be done us what what kind of goddamn monster are you the only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards but it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect my attorney youll go straight to the gas chamber and even if you manage to beat that theyll send you back to nevada for rape and consentual sodomy shes got to go in a few hours shell probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering jesusbased rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd dragged her to a vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing uncircumcised member i figure she can do about four at a time christ if we keep her full of acid thats more like two grand a day maybe three its straight economics this girl is a godsend shit she can make us a grand a day shes perfect for this gig these cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her we can set her up in one of these back street motels hang pictures of jesus all over the room then turn these pigs loose on her hell shes strong shell hold her own well itll probably work out we can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention lucy well what are your plans you degenerate pig what fuck telegrams im in trouble you worthless bastard ill cripple your ass for this all that shit in the car is yours you understand that when i finish testifying out here youll be disbarred you bastard

run theyd like any excuse to shoot us dont go near that elevator thats just what they want us to do trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement probably the bartender he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress it wont stop its not ever going to stop ok lets pay this bill and get up very slowly its going to be a long walk that depends on how many people we fuck with

those people away from there you gave them the tape so after we kill the creature well begin a search for the nest you see all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that dont rely on heat seeking what are you suggesting dont tell me why its not tell me what the hell it is it happened so fast no one knew what hit them til is was over were hoping youre going to help us figure that out thats right youre standing on it then youre perfect heres your radioactive sample study it seventeen percent huh sounds big no but i have the feeling im about to find out yeah youre the worm guy we know we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise follow me right the worm guy can someone get those people off the beach dr niko topopolosis organize a search party i want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system were sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body thats not true our worm guy er i mean dr tatopoulos found blood general anderson the problem was the terrain if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park we should be able to take him down we think theres a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered areaoh just some insurance guy youd be surprised are you okay if the military are listening they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape your station wont have any easier time contacting the military than i did how do you know circuits are overloaded i was wrong what are you doing here so you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes i shouldnt have to audrey youre supposed to be my friend i trusted you well what the hell did you think was going to happen yes do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time the ultimate expression of evolution it reproduces asexually think about it all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction thats why he came to new york like every species of insufficient progenitors hes nesting well obviously these tests werent designed for this but fundamentally theyre looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy hes pregnant i got pretty close yes the first of its kind i found this blood sample earlier this evening i have this theory that were inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what weve done to nature when you and i use to attend rallies in college we helped to create awareness but from the inside now i can actually effect change i never lost my idealism wait im sorry youre right eight years is a long time can i offer you a cup of tea most people dont you just left me without a phone call a letter nothing all this time yeah i guess im still a little mad no im into earthworms now you wouldnt be interested theyre real boring creatures very reliable dependable no surprises youre a reporter thats what you always wanted to be right im happy for you really i am so you made it audrey is that you hi hello you look wow uh howve you been ill take them all make sure they find that nest before its too late me too i dont think so more than that i believe this is a mutated aberration a hybrid from the fall out in that region oh thank you is she always like this not for a long time now no perhaps i work too much oh im not married hi nick tatopoulos no its still in my tent itsoh my god she took it it may be too late by then these eggs will hatch very quickly no it reproduces asexually thats why we must find the nest if we dont dozens will be born each one capable of laying eggs of its own very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population um excuse me sir but the situations more complicated than that the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has well yes i did clearly he was injured and bled when i needed to catch earthworms i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them i had to draw them out you know hes not an enemy trying to evade you hes just an animal what do we know it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years the radiation is not an anomaly its the clue this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur somebody must have seen it but theres no animal in the world that can make prints like that is there that was a footprint i was standing inside a footprint what sample theyre enormous a new species created by mans recklessness thats what ive been trying to tell you im only a biologist i take radioactive samples and study them it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before mutated by seventeen percent the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworms dna you have any idea what that means do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm look i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field you didnt answer my question in fact for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions excuse me would you mind telling me what the hell im doing here its tatopoulos wait au revoir i understand where are you hello its okay i know her i cant get through i dont know whats wrong how do i do that good idea three eggs i thought there would be more theyve turned off the ventilation system theyre calling him to dinner whats with the chewing gum are you kidding i always wanted to join the french foreign legion here 23rd street subway station where we first found the fish with a little luck this will lead us right to it your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific sure so why all the secrecy why arent you guys working with the us military how did you get all of this stuff into the country oh my bags ive checked them in why do you need that why are you telling this to me are you sure how do you know oh sounds like a big company oh yeah the insurance guy do i know you thankskeri laurie how about if i just call you mom yeah me

twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game anyway big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands who can play baseball and there was a little voice that yelled out me i can play everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove whos telling this story there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball but he was too small and no one would let him play but he

anij if you want to know what its like to be a child you need to learn how to play why not data havent you ever just played for fun because youre it and if you tag me then im it chase me no i mean do machines ever play but youve never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you dont like sometimes i do for one thing your legs are shorter than everyone elses really i cant imagine what it would be like to be a machine dont you ever get tired i know why so people like us wont be afraid of you any more not everyone here agrees with him i mean you know about machines there was even a big fight about it once do you like being a machine i dont my father told me i shouldnt talk to you youre what the artificial lifeform was right wont he rust can he breathe under wateri have to go home now it is safer there i will join you shortly tournel will take you the rest of the way no ones ever asked me that before androids dont havefun but i can run much faster than you i am capable of exceeding fortyseven meters per second for what purpose i play the violin and my chess routines are quite advanced i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child my legs are eightysevenpoint two centimeters they were eightysevenpointtwo centimeters the day i was created they will be eighty sevenpointtwo centimeters the day i go off line my operation depends on specifications that do not change i can not imagine the experience of growing up or even tripping over my own feet but they are in a constant state of growth do you find it difficult to adapt a childs specifications are never the same from one moment to the next i am surprised that you do not trip over your own feet really perhaps it would surprise you to know that i have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child my power cells continually re charge themselves perhaps that is true i aspire to be more than i am i understand i am better there is no need for concern i am operating within normal parameters now i believe it is safe sir im showing fresh air behind this calcite formation captain another fortythree people reported taken sir captain ive activated transport inhibitors around the village why would the federation or the sona wish to move the baku it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence incomplete i might add it is clearly federation in origin captain tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills and i do not believe i made a very good first impression i am the personification of everything they have rejected i believe the boy is afraid of me i was in an isolation suit collecting physiometric data on baku children my last memory is going into the hills following a boy his nose should pant and his lip should curl yes that looks like them captain geordiif you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated the federation will pursue you until it is over were taking this ship out of here this mission is over youre not going to launch anything until ill order riker to turn around that is not an acceptable option if people get hurt all the support we have in the federation take me down let me talk to picard hes right our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies i know what data means to starfleet jeanluc but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation another time our procedures were in place to protect the planets population from unnecessary risk theres nothing further to be gained from this order them to surrender and i promise you wont be court martialed we are only moving six hundred people jeanluc it would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition some of them wont survive that long besides they dont want to live in the middle of the briar patch who would our best scientific minds already have we cant find any other way to do this the concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work dont ask me to explain it i only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction after its over the planet will be unlivable for generations with metaphasics lifespans will be doubled an entire new medical science will evolve i understand your chief engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life would you take his sight away from him on earth petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders warp drive transformed a bunch of romulan thugs into an empire we can handle the sona im not worried about that right we have the planet and they have the technology a technology we cant duplicate you know what that makes us their partners there are six hundred people down there well be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions the sona have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings the prime directive doesnt apply these people are not indigenous to this world they were never meant to be immortal well simply be restoring their natural evolution im acting on orders form the federation council thats why we put chromodynamic shields in place so our people wouldnt feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation youre looking well jeanluc rested just a few loose ends to tie up dougherty out ill need all your paperwork tomorrow were heading back your way set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out youve done a terrific job jean luc now pack your bags and get the hell out of there hows data good luck dougherty out all right you have twelve hours captain then i want you out of the briar patch in the meantime well be heading out to the perimeter to call for sona reinforcements in case you fail i wish i had better news commander data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday ruafo and i have decided to send in an assault team captain i wasnt expecting you we havent fully identified the anomalies yet theyre calling this whole area the briar patch it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you just get me datas schematics ill keep you informed dougherty out thats probably not a good idea your ship hasnt been fitted for this region there are environmental concerns and now hes holding our people hostage down therethe mighty federation could learn a few things from this village but i have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming i plan on using them i thought it might begin the healing process youve brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud admiral the children have returned to expel their elders just as they were once expelled except ruafos need for revenge has now escalated to parricide this way i should warn you ive always been attracted to older women how is it a woman like you never married and dont tell me you just havent gotten around to it yet by now the sona have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do roughly translated puberty although for a klingon thats not doing it justice any severe mood swings unusual aggressive tendencies be sure to let me know right away we can hold them off a long time once we get there but they will not make it easy to get there when were forced away by the terrain well use transport inhibitors to compensate the mountains have the highest concentrations once were there transport will be virtually impossible an offlander theres one thing i dont understand in three hundred yearsyou never learned to swim i wish i could spare a few centuries to learn seeing my home planet from space for the first time a perfect moment will it an apprentice for thirty years weve noticed your peoples mental discipline did that develop here the craftsmanship is extraordinary you give me more credit than i deserve of course im tempted who wouldnt be but some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one id like to believe we learn from our mistakes obviously some of us havent in defense of offlanders there are many more like me there are days most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down clearly the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret not just from you but from my people as well i dont intend to let them weve just begun to i suppose youre seventyfive dont panic to move you off this planet you go to sleep one night in your village wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse a week later maybe a month youve been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it data if you were following the boy and discovered this ship i dont like to leave questions unanswered i understand how you feel we just want to retrace datas movements that day you have warp capability if i were in your shoes id feel the same way after what happened the artificial lifeform is a member of my crew apparently he became ill my people have a strict policy of noninterference with other cultures in fact its our prime directive we were under the impression they were being held against their will if not for data youd probably have been relocated by now to many offlanders what you have here would be more valuable than goldpressed latinum and im afraid its the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you no data doesnt breathe is it safe to move her will he live prepare to transport the hostages to the ship very funny yewcheen cheffaw my collar size is exactly the same as it was at the academy will the structure hold if we blast through how many good lets begin to move these people out i dont know what possible purpose could a duplicate village have except to deceive the baku what youre seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields just a few loose ends to tie up a ship how about a passive radiation scan until this week that young man probably never saw a machine let alone one that walks and talks its nothing personal data you have to remember these people have rejected technology and you from the mission whats the last thing you remember data youre aboard the enterprise hello data i wonder which one of us will be facing that courtmartial if a courtmartial is the only way to tell the people of the federation what happened here then i welcome it how many people would it take before it becomes wrong a thousand fifty thousand a million we are betraying the principles upon which the federation was founded this is an attack on the very soul of the federation this will destroy the baku just as cultures have been destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history the baku then the sona can establish a separate colony on this planet until we do delay the procedure let my people look at the technology there are metaphasic particles all over the briar patch why must this planet be someone probably said the same thing about the romulans a century ago our partners are nothing more than petty thugs a planet in federation space who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people how can there be an order to abandon the prime directive or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world i wont let you move them admiral ill go to the federation council your briar patch turned out to be more hospitable than i expected youre not finished here in stasis la forge is completing the diagnostic and because they have warp capabilities the consequences to their society are minimal understood sir commander worf and i have been working on several tactical plans to safely this was too important for the enterprise to be on the sidelines admiral what kind of concerns the enterprise can be at your position in two days admiral you have no idea what precipitated his behavior scan for lifesigns what if he doesnt realize somethings happening can you get me to a transmitter i have to speak with worf and data on the surface well need their help if we could lure him away from the bridge do you know how to disable the injector im not begging for my life im begging for yours there is still a way home galna a coward without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity you offend me had regenerated implants bothering you and yet he attacked us and told the baku we were a threat so youre saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong failsafe why would they fire at him without provocation the sona reports claim they didnt fire until after he malfunctioned do you know how they were damaged when i was an ensign i could detect a threemicron mis alignment do you have everything you need from command are they i want our guests to depart as quickly a etiquette allows ill ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so he can join us were going to stop by sector fourfour one on our way to the goren system top level review my ass therell be no coverup of this not after i get theres a short letter i left you all just some sentimental nonsense the computer will bring it to your attention at oh fourhundred id just as soon you delete it go back to your quarters thats an order prepare the ship for departure at ohsevenhundred hours deck five were not going anywhere so where are the environmental concerns the admiral was talking about we wont be able to go any faster than onethird impulse in that muck who is it yewcheen cheffaw so they need us to put out one more brush fire anyone remember when we used to be explorers we cant delay the archaeological expedition to hanoran two it would put us into the middle of monsoon season ask them youve not aged a day since then no were here to rescue them jeanluc picard my officers doctor crusher and counselor troi i understand tell doctor crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready worf you must hurry yes yes i can hear you well skip the court martial this time picard out slow to impulse were on our way is there any other way to disable the injector can you beam him off decloak the holoship and engage a tractor beam mister worf we have to find shelter very well well take an hour break out some rations you need a haircut commander no well be responsible for that mister worf picard to crusher gorch debrief them again have you been in a fight commander did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings transferring controls to manual im not letting go of him theyre composers worf from the nineteenth century data was rehearsing a part in hms pinafore before he left a british tar is a soaring soul as free as a mountain bird his energetic first should be ready to resist a dictatorial word do you know gilbert and sullivan evasive maneuvers heading one fourzero mark threeone prepare to enter the atmosphere well use the ionospheric boundary to shake him beam him out make it so hmm oh its just something my mother used to come out come out wherever you are the metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux steer clear of them mister worf transmit a wide band covariant signal thatll get his attention its good to have you back worf slow to onethird take us in worf what the hell are you doing here counselor you have two days to become experts mister worf your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture data better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette something that goes well with chrysanthemums say the greeting againthats your expert opinion will that stop the tear if we dont outrun them the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship full impulse a photon torpedo isnt that the universal greeting when communications are down its our only way out of here mister nara the purpose being i intend to shove it down the sonas throat eject the core on screen why not blow out the ramscoop stand by full thrusters were through running from these bastards remind me to lodge a protest yes we do youre relieved ensign take over at ops whats inside that nebula cluster how long til they reach us the council has ordered a halt to the baku relocation while they conduct a toplevel review fat chance ill post it on every monitor on the ship you must be planning on doing some hunting aye sir you klingons never do anything small do you admiral dougherty wants to know why we havent left yet the only unusual readings were low levels of metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey and gorgonzolla cheese commander riker deck ten the diplomatic corps is busy with dominion negotiations they need us to mediate some territorial dispute all hands battle stations augh what i need i cant get from doctor crusher counselor do you think its possible for two people to go back in time to fix a mistake theyve made im not sleeping well both i think im having a midlife crisis or you could try lying down but its comfortable got a minute i need a little counseling first time for everything do i lie down or what if thats true theyre a dying race it says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the sona from procreating what youre doing to my neck you havent done that in a long time good question youre in luck it says here theyve taken women from several races as indentured servants nomadic collectors of precious metals jewels wine women and song i dont see anything to suggest the sona have any interest in sociology why was data assignednegative hes established a security field around the control room one its ruafo all injector subsystems are confirmed offline isolinear tags their transporters can lock onto them the baku could use some rest sir according to the geoscan this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers accelerated hair growth is often experienced by klingons during jaktahla should i distribute phasers to the baku sir doctor crusher asked to talk to you when you returned no sir it is a gorch no sir the damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire sir inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance if we dont release him he may destroy both vessels no sir i havent had a chance to meet all the new crew members since ive been back scanners are off line hes activated a transport inhibitor direct hit hes resetting his shield harmonics sir if we fire a tachyon burst it may force him to reset his shield harmonics when he does we could beam him out sir he might be using the planets rings to mask his approach sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface ive already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down captainyeah yeah im going to the corner to get a cup of coffee heavy heavy what i wouldnt give to know what heavy feels like you insensitive prick smatter with you you look like youre fading you heard

be okay ive got a friend in the boston police department he faxed me this this morning ill just give you the highlights after a short stint as a petty thief patrick r healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen at sixteen he committed his first murder a pretty teachers aid named molly pettygrove he was incarcerated until age twentytwo when despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him in his mid twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington unfortunately the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasnt enough evidence to hold him and on and on and so forth and so on mary the mans a killer i think youd better sit down well ive got a little more news about your friend healy thanks but ive got to be going unfortunately doc this isnt a social visit i mean lets face it mary youre beautiful youve got money you trust people im just saying theres a lot of psychos out there i thought so anyway i hope you dont think im being meddlesome i just think you should be careful with this guy look its just that something about him struck me as odd last night he gave me this funny vibe anyway i called some friends back east they dont know of any architect named patrick healy and hes not listed as a harvard alumnus thats what youve been looking for a farter well thats what im trying to figure out how long have you known him you dont think theyre too big whats up doc where would i have seen your work hey no kidding where are your officesrightbecause every ants important no an individual well because hes more than a workerhes awhat did he call it azteca you know youre not just workers you can be whatever you want to be look at z he started as a worker then he became a soldier z our z the little guy made it no i mean yes i mean if you dont have other plans sorry i got you in trouble but listen you can share my rations nobody told me digging was so much fun you pick up the dirt you move it you pick it up again you move it again lots of repetitions you exercise the forceps and the pincers im newi was born yesterday no sir thats correct sir ii have no idea sir thank you sir oh no sir yeahi meanwelli dont know really sir you heard the ant dig dont tell anyone youre a worker follow that column over there and come right back after the inspection yeah i know wear this maybe ill get lucky you know z i wouldnt do this for anyone but you will you introduce me to some worker girls i cant think of any its a sign that youre crazy do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is get real z she just dropped the scarf by accident well you just sit here and be a partypooper time to cut a rug z poor guys had one too many scouting missions and all the time ive known you youve been grumping and groaning you should quit making waves go with the flow z weve known each other a long time right who said there was a girl for you i was talking about a girl for me dont you want your aphid beer yeah but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes i dont know what youre talking about z ill be backthis colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground why are we even digging this thing thank goodness breaktime the squeaky wheel gets the oil sorry azteca here you go fellas fresh dirt alley oop shouldnt we be wearing gloves i mean this dirt is verydirty doesnt anyone think of hygiene boy am i hungry im so hungry im seeing double it looks like theres two million ants in here whens lunch tomorrow or the day after i mean ive got the whole package right a great life a beautiful wife and a few kids i know its crazy but i cant just leave dont argue with me if ive learned anything its that the problems of two people dont add up to a hill of ants in this world or beans something like that anyway ive got to warn the others bala that that lake we found i think the tunnels right underneath it formicas going to flood the colony thats what he meant when said there were too many ants why do they have you tied up here well ii know its a little strange buti thought it might come in handy if ineeded a scarf someday well to be honest i just liked having it sorry its been through a war not to mention everything else well trouble is my middle name actually my middle name is 985 but i dont tell people hey bala ii actually have something of yoursyou left it at the bar that night soyou never did tell mewhat made you come out to the worker bar that night forget it you go ahead i give up ii dont know what i was thinking insectopia yes lets dig in weve found it insectopia look at all this food come ontell me there wasnt just a littlesomething between us that first night at the bar the night we danced so what makes you so special and only you can become a queen look how many other princesses are there princess has it ever occurred to you that theyre not going to rescue you hlllllllp listen princess you cant order me around out here youre not the boss anymore out here youre just this lake is huge and so close to the colony think of the vacation potential want a list come on its gone what are the chances of that happening again i ruined your life look i was perfectly happy until i met you alright i was miserable but i was happily miserable waterwater oh you already said that ive got a name its z yeah well i have it on a reliable source that it exists now you follow the yellow egg that direction well thats an appealing offer butconsidering the options you go back me im going to insectopia is that the same standard you used to choose general formica oh come on youre the one who came after me the swarthy earthy sensual worker well i guess that makes us even look around sweetheart but can there be a society composed of just two ants theoretically yes but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it whos the bigger idiot the idiot who gets kidnapped or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot excuse me i pardon me and they call them social insects alright alright ill try to get directions from one of the locals how should i know at the worker bar you were pretty hot to trot then thats not what you said the other night gee uh could you say it a little louder i think there are some ants in the next colony who didnt hear you noas a matter of fact divinely uh sorry general iive always had this animal magnetism it ohoh well then one more wont matter ah yes well charmed im sure so princess have you ever danced with a hero and you are well if singlehandedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero yes i am wait when can i see you again oh thats okay ill let him off this time are you crazy this guys built like a pebble you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays you you think im right why should everyone dance the same way its as exciting as watching fungus grow well actually uh im sort of making it up the palace hunh i bet those royals really live it up of course theyre all a little you know from inbreeding so uh how come i havent seen you around here before what a bunch of losers mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system barbatus hang on barbatus hang in there buddy you can make it just take deep breaths ill try and find your body its got ta be around here somewhere no no yourelookin good youve got good color in your cheeks barbatus barbatus barbatus you you saved my life maybe they went out for the evening lets leave them a message and head home so were going back for more armor right i mean these guys are from outer space how are we supposed to beat them well what exactly does our platoon do serve beverages process paperwork attack but i hate

joined up but im quitting i got a trial membership cant we all settle this like adults were not larvae anymore well it wasnt a masquerade really it was more what id call a clever ruse oh of course oh hey thats great i think i see an old war buddy over there its been fun chatting good luck with the hallucinations well i i dont think living it up is the right term how about working themselves to death not enough food wow what a spread you know theres a food shortage in the rest of the colony soyou two are in love engaged as in youre getting married well i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind deaths back so tell me fellow warmongerdo you think princess bala likes men in uniform one to nothing royal victory party willwill princess bala be there no you you dont understand geez and i forgot my toothbrush lays it on a little thick doesnt he if you ask me hes one giant bore but but ive always felt life was about finding meaningand then sharing it with someone

here to get my palms read i need something translated youre blind for them but for me i cant i wont be able to stop no tearing me apart you dont understand the thirst get out of here what are you talking about we get out of this alive maybe ill take that miracle cure of yours how long have we been driving ive been better for what its worth im sorry you dont look so good any progress your mother sounds like a hallmark greeting card weve got a good arrangement thats all whistler makes the weapons i use them the vampires die end of story cancer for your miracle cure just get out of here i do i remember from day one people staring at me sensing i was different watching the fear grow in their eyes knowing in their hearts i wasnt human i cant close my eyes without hearing her scream you get used to the darkness serum its a human hemoglobin substitute nothing that wont heal by dawn youve been watching too much tv theyve got their claws sunk into everything finance real estate politics probably own half of downtown some kind of archive like me there are worse things than vampires out there the way they move they way they smell looks like we hit paydirt this place is crawling with them see the valets over there theyre vampires so is the doorman he will owned by vampires theres one of these in every major city and just like dominos they always deliver you telling me youre ready to walk through that door look closer what do you see here there is no cure its war now get the fuck out of the way preventive medicine for some live forever never get old the ultimate high because theyre vampire wannabes if theyre loyal if they prove themselves then their masters will turn them thats a glyph kind of like a vampire cattle brand that means officer friendly here is someones property any of the other vampires try to bleed him theyll have to answer to friendlys owner this glyph belongs to deacon frost weve been tracking him for a while now hes a familiar a human who works for the vampires see this mark he didnt get over it it worked didnt it figured theyd send someone after you thought id wait around and see who showed up do it youll be dead before you can file the complaint not anymore youve seen one of them you wont be allowed to live after that i dont care what you believe i saved your life once i dont plan on making a habit of it you want my advice youll be out of the city by nightfall if youre stupid enough to stay thats your business because youre tainted the venoms still inside you you could still turn on us hes a vampire you shouldnt be here maybe its time to start exploring other alternatives whistler says im building up a resistance to it i was in the neighborhood hows it going kam i dont believe that you dont have to be how could you be a part of this please fight him but you died i know just be quick about it will you do it right listen you have to finish me off you dont want me coming back going somewhere what took you so long wait maybe not i did some checking shes a hematologist knowledge like that might come in handy i had to increase the dose youre building up a resistance to the serum you shouldve killed her then are we bringing home strays now i dont know but the backup generator shouldve kicked in then were back to square one arent we sooner or later the thirst always wins how their own blood cant sustain hemoglobin i wouldnt go in there if i were you its best to leave him alone when hes like this frosts bodycount keeps rising and im not getting any younger am i i didnt he was cruel enough to let me live even gave me a souvenir to remember him by eventually he toyed with them first he made me choose do you understand which order they would die in i had a family once a wife three daughters then a drifter named deacon frost came calling one evening habit mostly just like this which is why youre here we could use someone with your experience the thirst overcomes him just like the others its not something he can control the problem is times running out his bodys starting to reject the serum and so far all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure blades unique you know a one in a billion anomaly he can withstand sunlight garlic even silver but he still has the thirst we werent sure we could trust you go on ill be fine you think id let him run loose without a chaperone blade ferrets their ratholes out i map them then we blow them all to kingdom come we keep in radio contact there is one other thing id buy yourself a gun if i were you if you start becoming sensitive to the daylight if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much youve had to drink then i suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself better that than the alternative consider it a parting gift vampire mace silver nitrate essence of garlic some of the old wives tales are true theyre severely allergic to silver various types of wood feed them garlic and theyll go into anaphylactic shock my name is abraham whistler this is blade as for our little homunculus here youve been bitten by a vampire weve got to try and burn out the venom just like a rattlesnake bite im afraid so you wouldnt believe me

up with the monsters makeup and look okay frankenstein tell me everything just like going swimming isnt it i cant believe im doing this can that count as one question will you tell me everything you remember about making frankenstein can we talk about the horror movies now i guess george cukor who made a star is born i never guessed too warm for a sweater anyway that you were forced to retire because uh a sex scandal then the rumors are true youre serious thats funny mr whale i dont mind no i never said you were or will be soon but its the horror movies youll be remembered for oh no i want to hear everything you made twenty pictures in all how much longer before we get to frankenstein your father was a schoolmaster everything start at the beginning nice and your lighting and camera angles youre got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it sure thats my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours bride of frankenstein i know peoples movies arent their lives and this is your house wow the house of frankenstein i thought youd live in a spooky old mansion or villa mr whale this is such an honor youre one of my favorite alltime directors i cant believe im meeting youtomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow when you diebe sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle i can undress myself thank you pray you undo this button nothing i didnt deserve oh clayton no i dont want to die alone but to be killed by you that would make death bearable they say you never see the one with your name on it but i want to see death coming at me i want it to be sharp and hard with a human face your face think clayton youd be my second monster almost as famous as the first it would be the great adventure youve yearned for a war story for both of us to share break my neck or strangle me it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me please clayton weve come this far oh but you have you undressed for me i kissed you i even touched your prick how will you be able to live with yourself wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms wont they be surprised oh but you feel good clayton relax clayton i cant hear you i cant hear a word what was that there are straps in back please clayton just for a minute long enough for me to see the effect for the artistic effect the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask its quite striking dont move you are much too human no it wont do so it is going to happen after all oh no my friend its digging itself up there is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it all my diversions have abandoned me parties reading painting work love all gone to me now oh death where is thy stingaling grave where thy victory barnett barnett on the wire oh but it does especially in light of the journey im about to make i dont recall memories of the war perhaps i dont remember that one a perfect night for mystery and horror the air itself is filled with monsters not at all thats where youre wrong clayton youve just told one a very good story indeed im very sorry what happened is that why you joined the marines for your fathers sake a very lucky thing indeed the great war i see but you said come now im sure you came across such situations in korea a wounded comrade or perhaps one of the enemy someone for whom death would be a blessing tell me something clayton do you believe in mercy killing id like to try again if youre game after dinner if hanna isnt back can we try a few more sketches the only memento i ever kept my original sketch for the monster very sporting of you clayton sorry my pajamas are tailored would it be too distressing to continue with the towel no more immodest than a kilt you know that only leaves the rest youre much wider than i am you wont want to attempt to get into my pants im afraid not terribly sorry i believe i promised you some clothes oh of course clayton you finished your shower already certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man its not like her catch my death were not sugar we wont melt lets get out of this funk hole run for what monsters the only monsters are here neither of us really belongs here are you enjoying yourself david produced her last picture girl oh elizabeth taylor david the friend i thought was in new york nothing of importance just two old men slapping each other with lilies shall we have a drink exactly cukor was too cheap to hire music theres nothing but chinwag the cold dreary custard of english chinwag what did i tell you listen nothing would please me more i suppose youd like the top down good afternoon clayton very good clayton may i call you clayton or do you prefer boone if you dont mind driving id like to take you as my guest there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused it was foolishness to attempt this portrait you can not force what will not flow my apologies i had no business snapping at you i want i want just go please why dont you go of course i remember do you think im so senile youre very clever mr boone you just sit there and let me talk what a sorry old man youre thinking what a crazy old poof why are you here what do you want from me why do i tell you this i never told david i never even remembered it until you got me going you will not set me on another walk down memory lane not this lane not today barnett was that his name leonard barnett he came to the front straight from harrow and he looked up to me unlike the others he didnt care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters how strange to be admired so blindly i suppose he loved me but chastely like a schoolboy no my dear the crimean war what do you think the great war you had a good war while we had i was an officer not at all i was in the foxholes myself oh there may not be atheists in the foxholes but there are occasionally lovers no teammates in football no comrades in korea same difference mr boone disgust fear of the unknown all part of the great gulf that stands between us am i right in assuming that youve had little experience with men of my persuasion and the fear you showed at our last session how did you overcome that what about your stint in korea im sure it was full of dramatic episodes everybody has stories to tell im curious mr boone what convinced you to come back mr boone youre not due to cut the lawn until wednesday oh no i never swim the extras are in their places now we need the star wouldnt you like to get in the pool i assure you mr boone i meant no of course they werent nearly as bashful no this room was once filled with bare buttocks and pricks hard arrogant pricks twenty years too long we were like a play whose run outlasted the casts ability to keep it fresh so i finally decided to close down the show but i chose freedom david was still in the thick of it his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue i didnt fancy spending my golden years as merely the friend the dirty little secret of a nervous producer better work i think we all want to feel weve left our mark on the world yes i wish i had done more work its so far in the past now over fifteen years after that i went out of fashion i was no longer able to command the best projects so i walked away why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business the fucking studio butchered it it was 1937 hitlers armies were already massing and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor anything to avoid losing the german market they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick the picture laid an egg a great expensive bomb for which i was blamed you might not think it to look at me now but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession the horror movies were behind me id done show boat major success great box office now i was to do something important the road back an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany it was to be my masterpiece in a way yes i suppose so i know its why i stopped making pictures i like that but take care mr boone freedom is a drug much like any other too much can be a very bad thing ah a philosopher very well put why not tell me more about yourself mr boone you have a steady companion of course i dont want to scare you off not before im finished with you suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders two buttons is that so much to ask just two little buttons oh dear i have made you nervous but we have to match the other sketch it will only make you selfconscious youll have to remove your shirt i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today so we understand each other dont be ridiculous i know a real man like you would break my neck if i so much as laid a hand on him besides youre not my type what way might that be i never thought you were oh dear if one must have a clinical name does that surprise you or a husband depending on which of us you asked my friend david he lived here for many years no at least not in the legal sense just a trim and mine while youre at it fingers are a bit stiff today all righty i understand ill pay our going rate plus what youd get if you did the hedges what is we say phooey to the hedges could you spare an hour after lunch to sit for me yes i believe you could how free is your schedule this afternoon quite true handtohand combat is the true test did you ever slay anyone handtohand its nothing to be ashamed of in the service of ones country thats something to be proud of did you kill anyone of course i had to make it interesting for myself you see a comedy about death the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isnt in on the joke but the monster never receives any of my gibes he is noble noble and misunderstood pity people are so earnest nowadays did anyone laugh did you now yes an old useless friend you must excuse me mr boone this is a world i finished with long ago i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment lunch should be ready shall we is this davids doing do you mind i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor how are you mr boone so glad you are free for lunch you have to excuse me mr boone since my stroke i am often overcome with nostalgia in dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any american can imagine every englishman knows his place and if you forget theres always someone to remind you my family had no doubts about who they were but i was an aberration in that household a freak of nature i had imagination cleverness joy where did i get that certainly not from them no you were middle class like all americans theres something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth yes my family ate dripping beef dripping and four to a bed and a privy out back in the alley are you also from the slums mr boone ive spent most of my life outrunning my past now its flooding all over me im sorry ive just realized how terribly ironic it all is of course not as i said only poor people it is only the poorest families ever ate it we kept ours in a crockery jar dripping do you ever eat dripping in this country the fat from roasts and such congealed in jars used like butter on bread its a bit like being at the doctor isnt it you have to remain perfectly still while i examine and scrutinize you would you be more comfortable barefoot feel free to remove your boots and socks thats exactly what i intend to do we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness oh if its going to make you uncomfortable perhaps we can find something else for you to wear pish posh mr boone im not your aunt tilly im sorry its too white too distracting would it be asking too much for you to take it off that shirt mr boone hmmm i much prefer show boat or the invisible man shall we begin you dont say which picture excellent well have a most interesting time i have no interest in your body mr boone i can assure you of that what are you suggesting youll charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him indeed id pay for the privilege of drawing your head i apologize for going on like this its the sunday painter in me of course i can understand your refusal its a great deal to ask of someone yes you were a marine you went to university but expressively broken how did it happen you have the most architectural skull and your nose very expressive sat for an artist been sketched to an artistic eye you understand have you ever modeled you must excuse me for staring mr boone but you have a marvelous head nothing serious a touch of stroke i returned recently from a stay in hospital when they stay in your employ too long servants begin to think theyre married to you please mr boone help yourself merely comfortable heres hanna with our refreshments can you get the door i made only the first two the others were done by hacks this and that the only ones you maybe have heard of are the frankenstein pictures in my youth yes but never in hollywood no i was merely a director here but before i retired you might say i had a brief time in the sun fame as it were tell me do you like motion pictures they were familiar when i painted them that ones copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago and thats a rembrandt you know what they say if you have to ask what oh yes splendid or would you prefer a beer the honest sweat of ones brow i assure you i wont be offended let me tell hanna to bring tea for two i was just about to ask hanna to bring down iced tea id like it very much if youd join me everything alright mr boone getting to be a warm day a scorcher as you yanks call it the marines good for you you must have served in korea i couldnt help but notice your tattoo that phrase death before dishonor what does it mean and your name is my name is whale this is my house good morning yes perfectly then who did no i never could you must regret having had the invitation sent but i have no reputation im as free as the air oh dear ill never work in this town again i did but princess margaret was a doll were all equals in her eyes as commoners i presume you should have seen georgies face when he met clayton oh david stop being a nanny just what i was about to ask you i thought you were in new york thank you oh david theres no pleasure in making you feel guilty you better go my boy youll be late for that aeroplane the fault dear david is not in ourselves but in our stars i wanted to be alert for your visit today especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital its the ridiculous pills they prescribe if i take them i spend the next day stupid as a stone if i dont my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once you seem to be saying that this isnt just a case of resting until im better that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life so what do i do but the rest of it the killing headaches the phantom smells my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once its all nothing more than bad electricity youre saying theres an electrical storm in my head yes yes dr payne but from the neck up whats my story there goodbye so nice to see you oh dear of course perfectly all right but if youd like to sit but you appear quite fresh my dear oh nothing out of the ordinary growing old elsa nonsense my dear you look extraordinary todays script quick and a pencil bring a mirror let the bride feast upon her visage ill be out this afternoon remember your family can visit as long as they like it needs a hat there was a widebrimmed cream fedora of course how is the old boy these days do you miss having someone to talk to hanna id hardly call our yardman a friend who was that at the door does the yardman come today ill be fine hanna thank you she is beautiful no hanna my heart isnt that black dont be silly hanna hes a very proper actor and the dullest fellow imaginable go just go we can manage without you yes yes yes i merely invited mr boone in for a glass of tea well have a brief chat and hell finish the yard my minds lovely and yours no let me lie here thank you oh shut up all we did was talk my attack had nothing to do with him you must think im terrible hanna luminal yes dont be daft its just a student from the university there is iced tea hanna cucumber sandwiches hanna whos the new yardman my monsters i commend you if youre going to pursue poofs go after those who can do favors for you you waste everybodys time when you court dinosaurs you mr kay how do you know george cukor you didnt mrkay im sorry i spoiled it for you you should probably go home head not heart i just need to lie down studio daybed in studio you think so thats very kind my idea muchly my sketches big heavy brow head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new like tinned beef universal wanted me for another story and wanted me so baldly i mean badly not baldly i was given the pick of stories being developed and i picked that one righto let me see maybe youd like a swim when were through i never swim myself so the pool tends to go to waste of course certainly mr kay is there anything in particular you want to know dont be shy theres time to stop before you go too far take off your vest and ill tell you a story you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago nobody cared a tinkers cuss who slept with whom so long as you kept it out of the papers outside of hollywood who knows who george cukor is much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica a homosexual scandal you mean for me to answer a question of that magnitude youll have to remove both your shoes and your socks what rumors might those be quite it is isnt it my life as a game of strip poker shall we play lets make it more interesting i will answer any question you ask but for each answer you must remove one article of clothing i have a proposal mr kay this mode of questioning is getting old dont you think i am not dead yet mr kay twentyone the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking the horror pictures were trifles grand guignol for the masses am i correct in assuming mr kay that its not me youre interested in only my horror pictures there was one play in particular a beautiful grim study of war called journeys end every experienced director turned it down so i offered myself bullying and begging for the job journeys end made the careers of everyone associated with it it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned of course i attended eton it wouldnt do for a masters son to attend where his father taught i was to go up to oxford but the war broke out and i never made it the great war you know you had a good war but we had a great one yes i was born outside london the only son of a minister who was a master at harrow grandfather was a bishop church ofchurch of eng so mr kay what do you want to know this is the studio where i paint after you then will that be good for you mr kay is it now hanna i think well take our tea down by the swimming pool one likes to live simply no i expect you cant maam the pleasure is all mine james whale sit fine quite fine and your royal highnessi dont know lets just go and well see you want to take a walk with me was the trip okay tubab means white man no i am a tubab yes and i have two choices i can either fight the way things are or accept them see i always knew i loved you more didnt bother me i always felt lucky a little amazed that such a vibrant beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me and i guess i thought as long as i did everything right if i was the best husband i could be the best father even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us if i could do all that it wouldnt make any difference if we loved each other the same or not i wasnt asking for more i told myself i didnt need more but you dont know how you feel about me you dont know if you want a life with me anymore and i dont want you to come home until you do know one way or the other ill tell you something annie i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse and i swear it felt like the same thing was happening to me take your time may i have a suggestion connecticut i told the office id work out of there next week when are you planning to start back how are you feeling about work you were right about coming here im sorry for not thinking i can see why you put your faith in him hes a genuine good guy good at what he does thats rare i apologize for the surprise but the days only opened yesterday and i figured small bed maybe i should sleep in the barn honey i hope youre not endangering your position listen if you need to come back and you want me to come take over for a while ill work it out i mean the firms got other lawyers but the magazines got only one of you apparently gottschalks been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors lucy said she tried to call you but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon well uh the real reason i called actually was to tell you i saw lucy at jojos tonight and she seems very worried i wish i did huhhuh you oh well branding will do that to you i thought you guys were going to call me good night i miss you annie well then maybe i will take some time come visit when are you coming home so how are you doing in marlboro country is the magazine complaining at all taking forever i just got an additional list of sixtytwo employees to interview before monday i dont know how im going to do it and you think its best if i dont come what if she doesnt want to go i really wish i could understand why you think this is so necessary im not pretending anything are you a psychiatrist he said it takes time her psychiatrist said she needs security now stability no its uh no i really dont think its a good idea what bo what about the magazine you want to do this by yourself how you cant take care of pilgrim all the i come home and you tell me were going to drive a psychotic horse to montana i cant just pick up and leave youve already made arrangements no what are you youre serious about this thats the craziest thing i ever heard absolutely not i dont understand you just said he said no what was i saying what did he say did you get a hold of that horse guy theyre still our friends annie its nothing serious you kid about them all the time and i could tell paul really appreciated me being there all our favorite people were there saying all their favorite things about their favorite subjects i thought to myself weve been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody were so afraid we wont like each other and have nobody go to dinners with doing what i love you i had to excuse myself from a meeting its ridiculous i kept thinking about the baby you and i swear i was going to start bawling right into my briefs hows my pregnant chick fresh wind in her hair life without care shes broke but its ok and uh mario called about moving the wisteria its on the table by the phone i didnt know what to tell him whether or not we were if we still were thinking of redoing the couch oh uh i meant to tell you alex brought that fabric over the funerals on friday i saw judiths parents while you were at the apartment i wanted to say something but i i was so relieved that grace was still that it wasnt our daughter no let me go nothing new hes just going off duty im sorry no its got a little left theyll be in to change it she was in pretty bad shape theyve done a cat scan she has some hemorrhaging okay well see you later then thats okay we have to talk about it and were not always

knowing where youre from where you belong what feeds you where you can go no matter what happens knowing what youre supposed to be doing while youre here i hear that see i knew she was never going to be a ranchest but i wanted to try i thought maybe shed give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school maybe even recitals my son would grow up here maybe have one or two more id teach em what i could theyd play with my brothers kids all grow up together and even if they all decided to go out into the world theyd always know where home was cause wed keep it for em ever think of moving there

prepared to give it a go if youll help you have a problem with that when i work with a horse its no good just me doing it it doesnt work that way the owner needs to be involved too doesnt matter uh no i was gon na take a look now i uh ha ha i dont think i ever met a lady quite like yourself and i appreciate all the pains youve gone through to all by yourself you mean you hauled him all the way out

i i dont mean to sound insensitive i understand your situation but theres nothing i can do you just called the wrong person thats all i hear there are a bunch of therapists in new york maybe you should call one of them maam first class to montana is a waste of good money now am i being too polite here or when i say no in utah does that mean yes in new york city look even if it was nearer

yeah hello this is tom booker i got a message you called no thanks diane takes care of the books i dont know how but at the end of every month everything adds up to the penny i believe so saw it on a television show once i dont believe theyll expect that he thought it was a ghost i dont think warren would go for that well id like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding they dont get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow and theyre good mother we should be fine then yeah i dont believe it grace listen youve got to do this just trust me one more time hes not hurt hes okay look at him grace i need you to come with me its more or less how it sounds sometimes its not pretty to watch some horses fight it real hard your fellas already shown us he likes a good fight so if you dont want to watch ill call you when its done theres still something going on inside of him i cant reach so me and smokey here were going to try laying him down okay sure theres no hurry take you time i know you do dont you disappear you do whatever you have to to hold on ill tell you one more thing when pilgrim reared up to face that truck you know what i think i think that damn horse loved you so much he was trying to protect you thats what i think i wont tell you itll stop feeling this bad but i can tell you you didnt do anything wrong the same thing would have happened to me or frank or joe and theres no sense in looking for a reason why things happen i used to try and always came up short i dont think the why sos important as what we do with what we get i remember this boy id see up on the blackfeet reservation he was sixteen great kid strong hed gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock snapped his neck paralyzed him after the accident id look in on him from time to time and he wasnt there anymore his mind his spirit whatever you want to call it it just disappeared and what was left was nothing but anger its like the boy i knew just went away somewhere getting old not being of much use i guess what went on out there grace with pilgrim that must have been pretty special where did you get pilgrim from not a question of if you can you are just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself just follow this nothing to it im going to shut my eyes here for a little while just keep going till you run out of road well theres only

its cheap like a budgie i still will if you dont mind hatchet has a colleague a monster of a man barry the baptist the reason he is called bacon is he spent so much of his youth in the police station

queen on it will that do invitations i mean its fucking empty theres nothing in it tom go and throw those guns off a bridge i dont know but what i do know is that theres no more harry which means theres no more debt and if theres no more debt theres no more problem and theres no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead i think if i get this right we havent done anything wrong

language and a feather duster what do you think they will be armed with guns you tit hit the fuckers are you sure you can afford twentyfive the only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside tom tom dont mess around lets go this is our money tom now i think we should go tom this is our case you and me tom he said he thinks we have paid him and he wants to talk about those guns now where the hell are we supposed to hide everything all right out there tom top of the list of priorities how nice they look why whats up he means theyre thieving dogs the man

they could do more harm than good its hit us all hard i would rather put my money on a threelegged rocking horse the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason bacon it wont win so where is ed with all the bright ideas when the old bastard is not playing cards hes chasing a thousand debts that illfated individuals owe for an array of reasons what do you mean i dont think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid well whats going on you what what are you on about i hope this is the right move you think its a good idea taking it back to yours and look what happened to that no i fucking dont you cant make a cup of tea edward where the fuck are they going to butcher a sheep i thought this was a robbery carrying them they could all be carrying them for what we know guns you never said anything about guns a minute ago this was the safest job in the world now its turning in to a bad day in bosnia what was that armed what do you mean armed armed with what well what do you want us to do about it well that depends on how you look at it i can afford it as long as i see it again if thats what you mean you got the rest from the fat man and bacon ok dont panic lets think about this the money the gear how the fuck should i know er well twelve twelve six tom the fatter you get the sadder you get i would take a pain in the arse for half a million what about all the gear whats left over when the bottle in my arse has contracted ill let you know where did you get those from a museum well excuse me brother mother or any other sucker doesnt make any difference they are still fucking guns and they still fire fucking bullets oh you assume do ya what do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuckups tom youre all heart youre not funny tom youre fat and look as though you should be funny but youre not thats going on optimism get your fingers out of my soup cupid stupid thats the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom call that fresh there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit you should open a butchers not a grocerswell not exactly no i got em sitting in the car actually i thought we might sell them back to the greek but i am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him i wanted to talk to you about that a what is there something we should know about you soap seven hundred for the pair well its still a good idea probably no longer than four weeks ill kill him soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour he is proud of his job and even more proud that its legal we paid seven hundred quid for those guns they could hardly trace them to you could they ill only be a minute i11 meet you in the car what what do you mean me well what did he say right as rain i dunno but they look nice i rather like em er let me guess my foot in your arse a game of cards and hatchet harry youre supposed to be getting some rest boy what the hell are you doing here what do you mean you see its not easy to take a seat at this table the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters whos this fat man then all right lets forget about them for the time being what about your weed man range i dont want to blow the arse out of this country granted but i dont want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either i want to look fucking mean they look nice i agree but lacking in criminal credibility arent they i might get laughed at how much do you want for these muskets jesus if i pick them up will they stay in one piece where did you get them from i think youre nick the greek never mind that now i also need some artillery you know a couple of sawnoff shotguns neither me but it depends on what flicks your switch and the lights on and burning bright for the masses not normal weed this is some fuckedup skunk class a i cant think let alone move shit you know it doesnt include the amp you know how much it is nick what are you talking about i am bloody skinny pal thats fucked it what do we do now no money no weed its all been swapped for a pile of corpses how come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy thats right so how many whiskers has the little white kitten got how many feet how many wings have they got between them theres six black cocks sitting on the side of the road how many beaks have they got between them you would take a pain n the arse full stop this guy rory breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling its not worth him giving us trouble he knows we would be a pain in the arse and who wants a pain in the arse hold on give us half a chance to count it well jesus that wasnt so bad was it nick the greek its the mother of fuckups stupid listen cooky you want to make sure that man rests before he plays its in all our interests what you telling us for the only thing i care about is whether you get your rest in whatever its going on its still enough to send you on a cooking course so a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty for twentyfive grand invested thats going on previous experiences if you will order stuff that comes from katmanfuckingdu dont be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route never mind that what about the money what have you come asshut up knave dont look so shocked phillippe come youre going back to prison i grow closer to my target your majesty your majesty if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel i will kill both him and the man who told me how can i serve you in this well perhaps you should speak with them your majesty your birthday celebration your majesty then to the bastille perhaps he serves a different king perhaps but of dartagnan i am certain what he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do be faithful to his king he seeks redemption bloody hell remember phillippe nobility is born in the heart it presses us but it is good for us too louis whims make him more vulnerable we are less ready but so are his guards louis is planning a visit to the vatican then who knows where after that if we miss him now we may not get another chance you said youd do anything athos anything to replace this king so do it i offer you the perfect revolution a revolution without bloodshed without any loss of life even without treason for he too is the son of the king he can learn to be phillippe in time but first he must learn to be louis and for that he has two more days paris there is still much to do well be back soon be ready the mask is terrifying especially when unexpected do you notice come now athos if porthos is determined to end his life then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity hes threatened to do it its been building up in him for months about to hang himself i should think now you were saying going into the barn naked or so it appears go on you grow fond of him thats good the king is having a ball a masquerade ball it is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one at any time phillippe could be discovered and what then remember france remember the poor remember raoul more wine where are those serving girls three days you can do it more wine how is he yes and he has a choice do you think i have not considered that i have a plan and you may rest assured that it is brilliant those can be adopted i have it all worked out there is that of course but mainly it is because i am so much smarter than everyone else those are the words of a broken spirit my spirit is whole i have trusted dartagnan with my deepest secrets and i will never believe he is my enemy you are bitter athos you are torn by grief not only for raoul but for dartagnan whom you love and now treat as an enemy you seek facts when it would be better to seek truth tomorrow excellent athos you have a keen sense of this man a body come we have a boat waiting soon enough here we are making the key to the throne it can i know the way replace the king well here is the problem at hand the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits and kill him as our english rivals have left the catholic church louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both he has already picked the pope only the jesuits who put god above throne or papacy stand in his way dartagnan those are young musketeers down there they have been weaned on our legends they revere us it is an advantage why dont we charge them they will know you helped us if we go this way phillippe get into the boat into the boat now pull them back pull them back dartagnan i know god go with you i have heard many confessions dartagnan but even if i were not a priest i could tell your heart has a secret weight and it is hurting you to carry it alone i will need you all all for one one for all look at us we are old men now but once we were young and when we saw injustice we fought it still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem a simple theological discussion dartagnan perhaps you should accept his offer for we are dead anyway bread and wine in that cupboard we will make our own luck tonight if phillippe holds up the queen mother anne but what if something extraordinary happened something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned then let him kill me if all my faith is wrong so was mary magdalene and our lord loved her come on we go someplace dangerous coming youve been moping for months now that youve gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way you can stop boring me and start being useful to me now get some rest because the old king had a twin as well and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne then he had two heirs not just sons but twins so he decided that one be put away as if he never existed you phillippe i carried the kings child the queen had twins that night and one of them was sent away in secret no not louis not just a baby porthos i carried the child of the king but i was on duty the greatest secret of life is who we truly are now i must give you that secret which has been kept from you your whole life it began on the night when louis was born i will answer all your questions but first soap water and a razor and why are you so glum easy to say but hard to do for what i am trying to tell you is that i am the governor general of jesuits in france so they tell us but what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant and the church meant to stand for all those oppressed has become the tool of oppression when no conscience is tolerated no dissent no objection catacombs very holy it is also a place of burial jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane if we are to have a place of private prayer where better than here beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river hell may be our destination dear porthos but not this trip cant you see im praying goddammit forgiveness there are more important things than tits be quiet you fat fool cant you see im prayingto the bastille and death so what has changed youre a fool we cant stay here that traitor dartagnan knows about this place hold your goblet with two fingers but aramis this will never but what youre asking is impossible but aramis phillippe can learn in time but where are you going all i noticed was that phillippe feels even more like an animal poor phillippe but but we must stop him hang himself but what is he doing but what is porthos doing dont play god with me aramis i phillippe hes very bright hes perceptive but he is in such turmoil three days in a year maybe two i could teach him enough to you must reconsider this plan phillippe is like a child he resting hes had a long day aramis it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours it is phillippes as well and people close to him who physical resemblance is but one small thing louis has an arrogance a manner switch that is your plan it is ludicrous then you are a fool a fool who has never lost a son what gives you the right to judge me to play god with the lives of others is it because you are so much holier than everyone else he who is not with us is against us you are not my priest aramis you would not be even if i had one tonight right now we steal a man from a royal prison we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide and still you wish to tell me nothing who is he aramis his plight is obvious isnt it prison was horrible but it was his home hes been torn from it by strangers hes frightened exhausted and the mask is familiar let him rest in it tonight and remove it tomorrow i see that is a body but where did you get it what is that the prison of belle sur porthos sleeps and you plot dont you think its time you told me what it is you are plotting what are they doing i am with you what do you propose to do and some problems can not be settled without one its a prison you idiot they dont expect anyone to try getting in the problem will come when we want out you are right but it is a trap he lures us to capture at a ball everyone watches the king what do we do now who does raoul raoul no you can not do this no matter how your heart is broken fromberge at the front no die what piglet what are you michelle can not possibly accept but are you sure that must be raoul raoul look dartagnans come to visit whats wrong you look awful she died giving you to me and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves perhaps this will help none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you he lies he is here to trap us if you ever loved me if you ever loved honor or anything else then stand now and let it happen why do you follow him dartagnan i know you have put service above your own life but why does this king deserve such loyalty he is a monster he executes ministers for his own blunders with their families hostage so they take the blame he has no honor it is honor you serve and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor the king killed my son to kill the king get out of my way save my son dartagnan you trust his character more than anyone else does oh my friend raoul is everything to me what hope is there a wartime commission can not be vacated except by the king and what chance is there of that fromberge is on the battle line and raoul you knew this was happening you knew and thats why you came shes a woman dartagnan from a poor family you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything but i am old and hard and ive seen too much even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire because power seduces even more than love this can not be everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse and the ladiesinwaiting are but mistresses for the king i was feeling sorry for myself raoul is getting married he proposed today i love that boy beyond all measure ive spent everything i own to give him education and opportunity now he has complete happiness and i mope another how many times have you saved his life in this year alone three four midnight mon dieu driving the youngsters hard eh you cant drink with a friend you havent seen in months life is too long except when we have our friends look at you youre still a boy sit sit ill open a bottle of wine dartagnan dartagnan one for all all for one phillippe she will be at the ball your mothers these rooms are yours up these stairs or through this hidden passage is the room of your mistress michelle how did you know no do not be sorry never be sorry the king cares for nothing and for no one there are no mistakes when you are king what you do is right for every person a king has contempt for everyone i will sit with you i cant sleep either i did not share beauty with someone who is no longer here for me to share beauty with it is something i have done or did not do i suppose it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison who pass such beauty every day and never see it the desire for vengeance can be a poison phillippe there is something i hope you understand terrible cruelty has been used against you and you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it recent hours have been a shock phillippe rest now and you never knew why who came are you hungryanne the night we had together i always wanted more but that one it was enough enough to make me love you forever i want you to remember that and go on as strong as you are now no matter what happens there were two not one but two i have never seen a sight more beautiful than you tonight my queen anne i know i know that to love you is treason against france but not to love you is treason against my heart i cant bear to see you cry what is wrong mlady if anyone sees it is death what mlady no mlady god smiled upon us mlady i trained those men myself they will stand and fight but if we are to die let it be this way that doesnt matter now once you are through dont stop until you reach the river everyone back you cant do it i can not betray louis i will defend him with my life the secret i carry i can not share not even with god you you can not ask me to betray my king i have sworn to him no stop we have grown wiser with age now we know that some problems can not be settled with a sword aramis the king wishes to see you i came to see you safely out check for yourself i can not athos dearly as i love you i can not no man is all bad or all good i believe i must believe that louis can learn and perhaps i can help him an oath is an oath precisely because it can not be removed the cannons killed raoul the cannons and love but not the king athos i know life means nothing to you at this moment but i will not let you kill yourself where are you going athos i beg you athos please raoul is hurrying to the front so i must hurry too i will also speak with the king for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused i know i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that raoul be kept far from the fighting i fear i know our king i came to try to bring you hope if the young woman truly loves raoul i heard your playing they must stay sharp there was an attempt on the kings life today i have ordered a drill of the royal guard for midnight and must be clearheaded for it thanks but not for me its been too long athos my friend there aramis porthos and athos too i know what they have done was a threat against you and yet that threat has been removed with no harm coming to your majesty if their passions were in error their spirits have ever been noble forgive them not once have i ever asked anything for myself i ask now forgive this man this prisoner your brother your majesty this man before you he is royal blood the same as you to spill it is the one thing even you can not do it is against the laws of god and of france i i thought he was but an impostor who resembled you knew you had a double yes your majesty it shall be done your majesty your majesty your majesty this ball with an open invitation to the nobility of paris we have no way of checking i just left the garden it was empty what did you see thank you your majesty order fromberge to keep him in safety it is the least you can do to protect your own honor at least help raoul not criticize plead love love your people and you will not bear to see them hungry love women and they will love you love yourself and there is more to love than he knew or that you know it is not raouls heart alone that concerns me it is yours i know you find women compliant especially the poorer ones like michelle but do they love you do you love them what about a queen to love a son of your own your majesty has had many women in his mind anyway and soon enough in hers she had written him many letters of love mademoiselle michelle beaufort she is betrothed to raoul the son of athos the musketeer who has served france through many tribulations then there is one more thing of an even more personal nature it is for your security that i have come your majesty for the security of your honor but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous then you must allow me to stay close to you so that the plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me your majesty phillippe no even if i could give up my friends i could never give up my son i must insist sire sire we have an emergency of security i must ask you to accompany mewear it until you love it and die in it dartagnan you will hunt down aramis porthos and athos and bring me their heads or i will have yours and as for you phillippe back to the prison you shall go and into the mask you hate he is nothing now what had you to do with this mother my guards are useless take her from me it it doesnt matter mother he is dead now dead you have prayed too much your mind is weak why would you ask now you never asked before i am king mother and i do not wish to discuss this with you he is dead by gods choice there is nothing to discuss what is it mother i am preparing for a ball mother dartagnan arrest them all phillippe why do you call me wh wha you bring me the heart of the jesuit general and you will have a palace of your own how goes that favor i asked of you once a musketeer always a musketeer eh perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is you are now a priest but you were once a musketeer serving the throne of france a throne ordained of god can you accept this mission and keep it private i have demanded it and common priests present themselves can you imagine the arrogance common jesuit priests try to act as my equals and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france he suspects the governor general of jesuits whoever he is is angling to become pope himself next week this is a mere garden party and i wish to join it so i will be brief i am experiencing resistance from the jesuits where is michelle they have plotted against me me the embodiment of gods will forgive get out of my way my twin which has kept him alive until now he is my brother i was told this impostor was dead even the bedchamber passages let none remain i want all these passages sealed another stupid idea of my fathers seal them all every one tired must lie down you will protect me as you always have dartagnan it was nothing a nightmare nothing more go away i i will consider it now leave me silence i order you that is enough you are a good servant dartagnan but you forget your place you dare criticize my father or lecture me what quaint notions dartagnan but they contradict my father who picked his queen when he was old and only then to bear me that is my desire and my desire is what should concern you not the sentiments of some commoner miss beaufort has accepted our invitation by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come as we wish her to be here betrothed i think not a personal nature i already know about the riots dartagnan i heard them out there whispering some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food i will deal with it tomorrow aaa dartagnan these passages were constructed for the kings security not so you could step from my fathers portrait and startle me to death let us play a game dartagnan let us pretend i am king and you are captain of my musketeers let us behave as if my wish is law and my wish is to enjoy this party i am king dartagnan i will change my mind as i wish and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish i decided it this morning what is it dartagnan assassins falling from the sky now shoot them shoot them cowards twenty run from four when he returns watch him when he leaves again you tell me now where is dartagnan not by you i will order dartagnan to do it you may go lieutenant who was athos seeking tell me did he try to enter the palace did they kill him yes yes go on exactly why it should be given away ah yes the riots we have food stocks on the wharves right now no aramis i have been expecting you we are satisfied that will do sometimes the poor do grow hungry but why would they riot about it riots my people live in the worlds most beautiful city their king has the grandest palaces on earth why should they feel anything but pride and contentment listen my darling raoul was a a good friend and now he is dead and that is very sad but i will order a mass for his soul it will guarantee his place in heaven i did not want to upset you it was tragic i did everything i could for him i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety far from the fighting but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger no you may wait behind the screen if you dont want to be so appealing why did you touch the rose to your skin where was it here you are beautiful you know you are my dear ive already done it wait no do not be ashamed the straits of your family need not be permanent it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates where they may have fine meals and physicians to look after them this is more than you are used to your mother is a seamstress your father is dead you have three younger sisters two of whom suffer from consumption dont look so surprised kings know such things the food doesnt please you enough of this our dinner waits from raoul he urges you to guard your honor as if it could be in any danger from your king a letter may i see how did i get in youre new here and will soon learn many secrets what is that you blush you do not wish to be beautiful to your king i would have said it was impossible but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautifulthe old man and woman called me phillippe a man in black i never saw his face he took me to the cell a blacksmith came and they put me into the mask for days i shouted what have i done why do you do this to me but no one heard so i just stopped shouting this place i once lived in a country house i had guardians an old man and woman and tutors but no friends then when i was twelve they came and took me to the prison just water what was the end page twothirtyseven and the descendants of japeth are these obediah zebulon hezekiah what number on the first page what number did you tear out thank you keeper no keeperhe is right dartagnan can we eat before we go this excitements given me an appetite dartagnan watches everything we have to be lucky who hes going to kill you aramis did she have tits like that aramis these are these are whores lets see you rob somebody with your pistol there why didnt you say so what use am i well well okay but why athos do you understand this he confuses me the child of the king is the king louis i dont understand what does this have to do with you carried a baby somewhere its unusual but i remember that night dartagnan was drunk the only time ive seen him that way the three of us were reveling remember athos aramis athos he looks exactly like exactly like i expected action there was no killing no fighting i was useless it is a weighty problem aramis but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits whoever he might be but doesnt god ordain both pope and king a tomb were in a tomb mother of god where are we aramis is this the way to hell i observe your forgiveness isnt sweeter than a plump nipple forgiveness really if you can name me one thing one single thing that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips i will buy you a new cathedral i just said youre praying are you deaf too i know youre blind because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here youd have tears in your eyes please revel with me aramis i need my spirits lifted im old im weak my strength is gone it worked so what id rather die covered in blood than an old man lying in my own piss what choice is there if phillippe is in the bastille then to the bastille we will go phillippe has been removed to the bastille to the lower dungeon at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed and will delay the replacements for ten minutes that should give you ample time never have i needed more to say one for all and all for one dartagnan dartagnan unready i dont know about you but i plan to wait here best not to ask shouldnt even talk about it he gets one day of confession each year today is the daywell

not his real name smelled out your involvement drew he developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence unfortunately thats known as a conflict of interest the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou they were convinced that bontecou on past deals had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for the irs wanted to go after him and this deal offered them the opportunity i agreed to cooperate an irs man he is i told you to shut up its not necessary joe drews going to step aside joe dont do this get him in here i certainly hope so i loved susan from the moment she was born and i love her now and every minute in between and what i dream of is a man

and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about trust responsibility taking the weight for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them and above all not hurting the object of your love some aimless infatuation in which for the moment you feel like in dulging its missing everything that matters how perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you its not love susan is my daughter she has a wonderful life ahead of her and youre going to deprive her of it and youre telling me youre sorry well im sorry apology not accepted youre not taking susan anywhere and what the hell does that mean anyway youre what say again you want to know ill tell you youre looking at a man who tonight is not

you on the street really i was thinking the same thing if we could call time and get together for a while i wasnt sure you caught that i dont know i hadnt worked that part out yet all i knew was that i liked you and i didnt want to leave you there never see you again why not i hear he didnt mean to the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart i mightve smelled like a sewer but you could tell i was a gentleman they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy yeah but in a nice way she did huh thats not what you were about to say so do you it would be worth the risk well id say who i was and do you remember me and ask if youd like to meet for a drink i called your room from downstairs it doesnt have to its something that happens its like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds theres a kind of recognition like you both know something but then the next moment the persons gone and its too late to do anything about it but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go and you think what if i had stopped and said something it might happen only a few times in your life its not a game something you play i dont think it works if were somebody else you know what i mean gary and celeste jesus what do they know about anything how far do we go with this having it cleaned didnt help huh you did i like your hair and that suit a girl is that how you think of yourself well we got that out of the way tell me celeste what do you do for a living you like bourbon those guys

alright lets do it american did he bring that with him its a cocktail mostly demerol cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future my way is better its been known to happen long enough to shoot back all in the stomach though your man might live you shoot alright the point remains we could be working for different people theres a chance for one of us maybe more than one of us has been paid to cross the others i dont know about you guys but i like to know who im working for it can help prevent a great deal of unpleasantness i told you i quit gone destroyed i dont know nobody knows except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us theres probably a couple of guys back at the company who know but i dont think they plan to tell me anytime soon you better get some sleep alright you dont owe me a goddamned thing vincent and you know it you stepped in front of a bullet for me i owe you a heavy debt what of it what and now lets get him out of here ill work on it no i dont thats a good question and yet you would have killed him to save my life you have a sense of honor vincent that i cant even remember anymore i dont know that i ever even had it to begin with all i know to do vincent is to finish my job its the one thing ive got left to hold onto jeanpierre is one of your closest friends is he not because i dont walk away the mark of a true samurai what i do for the company vincent is no different than what you do were both hired guns and this is a job like any other job would you stop with that not just like that just before i turn around and its six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette time to quit not here they might see it yeah we need out fucking heads examined in a minute no you dont and you know it i know i dont need to say this to you but i need to say it to you this is my job i have to do it business keeps you on the road gim me a goddamn cigarette give me a cigarette i dont know you said it yourself gregors not dead if they had the package theyd have killed him they dont have the package how could you have done that you would have done that you were behind the door i never made that claim it is at that dark operations wet work kidnaping assassination im a field agent last of an already extinct breed i do dark ops sure i do you heard him you heard the guy thats what he said what edvard said its my job do what you sure your friend got the right place thorough man whats this the irish representative i know of him good now take the forceps and remember vincent what were doing here is routine ive done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field there are no vital organs where youre working no major muscles or arteries you cant kill me just make sure youve got the bullet before you try to pull it out you see the bullet you dont have to do this this doesnt involve you dont you understand i cant even guarantee you any money out of all this we there is no we in my world now vincent just me my job vincent a job you dont need to know about i cant go to the local cops theyd never be able to get close enough at this point its me or nobody and ive been on this job too goddamned long not to finish if i was a cop a real cop id have busted you a long time ago this isnt about you its about the job i have to do not exactly no hospitals ill fix this myself if i have to you know one around here somebody you trust i didnt save your life back there risked it maybe but i didnt save shit but you cant its paris the routes too indirect for anything else a guy like gregor he doesnt waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place otherwise hed be out of the country by now hes going to paris now i just hope we can find him before he gets there hes going back you might be a hired gun vincent but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits we live in a singular world my friend you dont you just learn to live with it ive seen a lot of people die before it was at that i have a feeling im about to start buying my own i borrowed that too i hope you dont mind i took your pack it was on the table i came up here to sneak a smoke whats going on gregors cell phone because thats what i would have done i saw you look off when francois nodded his head i figured he wasnt pointing out a particularly rare shrub and the rest was easy know what well i aint a cop you know what you pulled back there that was bullshit you need to know a lot of shit vincent see what whats going on theyd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york and it would still get fucked up whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless thats right theres not hardly enough work these days nothing that pays the big money anyhow then along comes this job paying so much goddamned money i couldnt afford not to take it somebodys paying through the nose for this who am i ive wondered that myself none of this answers my question though why bring me deirdre smart yeah and seriously goddamned dangerous watch that one hes an exspook for sure maybe stasi maybe kgb hes smart gregor is exactly why not bring them so vincent why bring me along for the ride job like this calls for a warm body somebody who can stand around and look threatening a tough guy it has its moments course you get cancer and die thats the down side i do i have i dont know maybe a cigarette a week ones a lot more painful than the other not at all similar but not the same jujitsu whatd you say to him i dont but the language hes speaking is universal and i suppose hes saying that we oughta give them something for using it huh as in they own it thats what i thought i can do that where to coordinate what he trusts you to lock up no thanks i know cops and youre no cop who else would you be sorry im late seamus reilly its the irish tape we want whys that im sure gaelic whats the storydo i need to repeat myself shut up shut up and drive im your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say is that understood plastic fucking surgeon you think im going to fix this deirdre lass its the mark of the patriot and ill wear it like a badge as for those who done it to me ill take my pound of flesh before this is all over good christ cant you lose these jokers about time lose them from interpol what in bloody hell is going on nothing problem my ass i think youre lying to me and if you are youre a dead man i thought i did its been known to happen it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you youve been living the life of the hired gun the well paid hired gun i might note theres no glory to it but there are those that like it now theres the deirdre i know figured enough to know theres an odd man out and im looking at him whats a little hate between business partners what am i doing here why im here to see my partners gregor the boys in the russian mafia see your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross but they only just found out that whats in the briefcase is completely useless without me i cant fight them and they cant kill me that means were gon na have to do business together youve told me a lot of things boyo this better be the real thing or youre a dead man if youre lying to me you poor excuse for a human being im gon na blow your brains all over this car you slept with the fucker you should have kill him when you had the chance but no how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us why didnt you kill himim up for that so where do you go from here i dont want you dead woman i want the the truth and i dont believe you when this whole thing started you made it clear youre running the show and i dont believe youd be running this show if you didnt know what was going on finding this package is a thing easier said than done we dont even know what it is what did we steal and then sam you and i clean up whatevers left to be cleaned while sam and i take out the back two cars we kept it of course then you better find it in your heart to tell me francois because while your death is inevitable it still isnt decided how painful its going to be wheres my information i take it you still want the money whats that heres yours what do you mean hes company do you have it how did you know not exactly of course dont you yes sams tough alright hello jeanpierre just to keep me company sam i hate smoking alone how about you i thought all you ira types smoked i guess thats for the best what happened to it tell me something first the package what was it i know your field dressing saved his life thats three i owe you nothing you speak french you sonofabitch finish it finish the job you have to stop doing that do you have a good answer and when you finish what then this package whatever it is do you give it to the cia do you really think they deserve it closest and oldest why not why then sam dont you act like this is a job like any other surely if you are a hired gun you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for why youve got more force of will than anyone ive ever seen you handle a gun like its a part of you you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia and most amazing of all you quit smoking just like that what of it samurai pain in the ass just like that if im going to die for the cia im going to go out smoking besides theres half a forest between us and them they cant see a goddamned thing do we need anything else i think not if our positions were reversed would you leave me so i do it something like that im not here very much why are you driving youre not french you dont live here you dont know these roads why are you driving right now you dont know bullshit you had her there was no way out what the fuck happened you think because i owe you look at that i would have tried not to but yes if it would have kept him from shooting you i would have i was waiting to see what would happen i didnt want to kill him if i didnt have to i know jeanpierre did not very zen of you huh not so much the modern samurai after all very ugly dark ops its a cover then a cover within a cover a feint within a feint you work for the cia its the only possible answer then quit you dont work for interpol sam continue when it would be so much easier to give it up tell me sam why do you do this if tony says this is it then its it the address of the russian production company just in case we need to find them yes you know him clearly alright its done yes i do it isnt about money for me not anymore im going with you it looks to me like were all thats left of our group and what job is that youre with interpol youre a cop fix it yourself why are we even doing this theres no need to run christ youre a cop noi thought id take you to the hospital you see it your way ill see it mine you need a doctor that makes twice now youve saved my life youre a copyoure a fucking copi should kill you not necessarily he could go off road at any number of places he might not even be in the country anymore i never really thought i was part of the world you move in sam to tell you the truth im a hood a thief big time in a small time king of way to the local police im a prize to the local hoods im a legend but to a guy like you im just another two bit hired gun i wont lie there have been times when i had to do it times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didnt i havent not like that how do you get used to it a lot of people died of coursewhenever you feel like it just help yourself please help yourself smoke as many youd like you were smoking you werent around when i woke up i thought maybe something had happened this has been one very fucked up job sam and im not taking any more chances on anybody including you the question still remains what do we do now but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did that there was a gun pointed at me how did you know i needed to see if you were a cop im a popular man with the police sam and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together and thats the guy you have to watch out for i hate cops i needed to know i just wanted to see something lovely isnt it they certainly are whatever it is were going to steal it must be quite something you were once some kind of special forces airborne ranger maybe a navy seal after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan a real mercenary only now now youre like the rest of us its a very competitive market since the end of the cold war theres a lot of hired guns out here and not nearly enough work to go around i wanted to see who you were i wonder if she truly left the ira so is the woman lets just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited of course i might have brought gregor but he didnt seem like the right candidate for this like larry or swede there is that christ i smoke a packandahalf a day and i tell myself i could be worse its just so damned pleasurable a cigarette as in one one cigarette a week who smokes like that help yourself since when do you smoke whats the difference same thing isnt it that was a nice move you did on our young friend judo i asked if we could give him anything else i didnt know that you spoke french something like that he says this is their block pretty much what youd expect to see a man about a thing things this is my country you know im vincent and i coordinate lets just say he knows who i am cigarette perhaps the police what makes you think were here to meet you you put everything on the line because you you slept with her you slept with her why didnt you kill her its a matter of respect why dont you wait outside this wont take long tony and i have to talk some business first i get the picture can you get it you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape do you have the tape i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new a friend i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes im alright and youi dont know what youre dwayne listen to me i cant get enough of it damn none of them had any looks like some kind of drug deal or something theyre not from around here one of thems still alive hey dwayne why dont you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin rock solid uh huh i cant i cant go on i cant keep lyingkilling thats not me thats not us its not about the money anymore cant you see that its about yes it is im calling it in right now its too late what are you talking about dwaynes dead no it stops now it stops here he killed her he found us he shot herhe killed her he killed herhe killed her then sally comes too weve got to go now then were not how do you figure that then were screwed it was all used random numbers how can they trace it i sure as hell hope so lets go maybe we should say somethin you dont know if he was really gon na jesus christ earlwhat are we doing like hell it is this is jesse jesse you killed him here it is what are you thinking we were only supposed to scare him how long is it going to take not bad enough to kill him youre crazy well what are we supposed to do maybe we can reason with jesse give him a third in exchange for the tape look earl we got ta go straight this is all messed up no yeah i mean youre coming unglued jesse you said that last time we had a deal what was i talking to the wall hes a partner now earl like it or not hes probably made copies hes not going to give them up to us and how do you figure we do that or get rid of the money i dont know well doesnt he besides if the dea heard that tape wed be behind bars right now just call it the cost of doing business this whole thing is screwed up im thinking maybe we should tell em the truth all right enough im tired of thinking about all this he would have done it to us right thats not what i mean i cant do that youre thinking about killing him i cant do that no way ive never killed a man never even shot at one what are you thinking hell tell them everything to save his ass thats how they all work it i should have known something like this was going to happen its the right thing to do we got ta turn ourselves in before they hear the tape oh right with a little help from his pals booth and earl im sure thats gon na fly real far when they hear that tape we assaulted a federal agent we killed him that guy was a federal agent an officer of the law just like us this isnt a joke what are we going to do were dead were dead we are dead what are we going to do forget it were going to bury it and were not going to even think about it until everything dies down and no one i mean no one hears a word about it understand look dwayne was right this is going to be a big story so big in fact that i dont want to even have this money around i dont want to hear about miracles and god and all that we tried to murder someone to cover our asses thats not what i mean ii cant do that youre thinking about killing him i cant do that no way ive never killed a man never even shot at one what are you thinking hell tell them everything to save his ass thats how they all work it he saw everything well i dont know im putting it out of my mind and you should too shhh were going to be patient if we start flashing money around buying fancy cars and fancy clothes people are going to ask questions ive got one condition i dont know torch it i do its little shit like that sends people to jail we have to cover all the bases if were going to pull this all right hold on lem me think shit did you touch the car at the expense of six people oh so gods like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks what makes you so sure its going to go bigger than that could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it suppose someone knows about the money theyre bound to ask questions i told trudy we were coming down this way thats why it wont work well someones gon na find them we dont know that we dont know whose money it is they might have robbed a bank who knows no we cant call it in i guess why what do you mean what are we going to do shit more than that ten thousand right here what the hell i probably would have i guess the clues damn near before everyone never heard of it cash and what seven thousand i hear you well i hope so that pretty much cleaned me out the horniest dog in nevada dont spend it all in one place sure thing and what are you doing earl whoa earl shut up jesse dont have much choice jesse you saw to that you dont expect us to believe that do you no its not just take it in stride none of us like it what are you proposing two thousand how much thats the deal if you dont like it forget it no one wins were going to wait all of us until everything dies down all right jesse well play it your way under one condition whats your offer jesse why dont you get to the point yeah so whats that you mean that guy was an agent could it have been in the mercedes no why how are ya sally do you love me i swear to you its true things just got a little screwed up thats all yeah i want to tell you everything

he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances his name is lee and he is to be shown every courtesy within reason you come highly recommended carter and your particular assignment

soon as they pick up the money weve got em carter can i have a moment i understand sir but you are an honored guest of the united states as i said sir weve got all the people we need ambassador let me assure you that the fbi has made this a top priority we have plenty of manpower on the caseshit that was no big deal fortytwohundred i figure not where i come from yep thirtyoughtsix norton longbarrel with dualgroove parallel rifling elevated threeglass scope and a singlethrow hammer we got us a tent fortytwo feet across eighteen feet at center hundredandten foldin chairs circuits eleven towns covers all a hasset county and most a weller county i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin said ministry i dont make jokes about things of or related to the preaching of the holy gospel including the ministerial calling of my family in the back of a nineteen and thirty one stretch hudson with a big ole trailer im jackson im from west fork tennessee my pappys a preacher him and his two brothers got a ministry the blessed church of the wandering gospel figured you writin a book or somethin i am but i like imported whiskey so there i am and i hear the biggest ole coon you ever did hear a rustlin right there in front of me that ole boy comes right out of the brush i got a clear shot and he knows hes bout to meet his maker i aim i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole coon go on now you get out a here then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a that mash whiskey me im walking with my hound lucy its about an hour fore sunrise and were out huntin coon i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey no kiddin like hell you did he aint wade he aint halfbad i guess i think im we got that eightyeight reiben are you makin fun a the way i talk yes sir capn so thats ryan yep you step on a rusty nail get lockjaw never say another word as long as you live just shut up ryan didnt kill wade shut up will you last i knew reiben how many time i got to tell you im from tennessee army life is too dang easy my feet have gone soft back home we go out squirrel huntin i walk forever and a day and then some dont even raise a blister you got somethin against the capn hell no last time i shot a corporal capn miller near bit my head off to each his own dont that get kind of expensive capn say what capn not yet sir i understand i dont like it but i understand sir i understand what youre doin but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner sir i aint feeling so chipper on account of wade watching we left them eightyeights in the shadow by those two trees yes sir it seems to me sir that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop smackdab in the middle of berlin germany now i aint one to question decisions made up on high sir but it seems to me that saving one private no matter how grievous the losses of his family is a waste of my godgiven talent seems to me capn this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources miller go on sir i have an opinion on this matter i most likely would have sir had i been given the opportunity captain my feet are most uncomfortable if id a known we was gon na have to walk all the way to ramelle i never would a volunteered for this here missionthank you sir the numbers dont make sense sir his brothers are dead thats too bad but theyre out of the equation sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away one private is simply not worth a squad colonel anderson this one is hes worth a lot more than that which is why im sending you youre the best field officer there is respectfully sir sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private doesnt make a fucking goddamned bit of sense sir but sirii a private sir sir pinned down a mile east of here waiting for some help from the navy guns yes sir they didnt want to give up those onefiftyfives sir fourtyfour twenty one dead a company wehrmacht no artillery we took twentythree prisoners turned them over to intelligence sector four is secured we put out the last three german onefiftyfives found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc find a chaplain its worth it you see ive got the best house in all of addley its not the biggest house but its got the best location right next to the junior high baseball field the garage windows face left field the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens twohundredtwenty two yards from home plate to my garage windows it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass i know were one step closer to winning it all im in my backyard lying in my hammock with my arm around my wife listening for the sound of breaking glass keep trying good now get your goddamned gear youll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve there is no wade there was one but he died a long time ago hes been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name you understand whos wade what the hells the matter with you jackson gives wade the second shot they dont send planes to put out machine guns two flank runners with surpressing fire im going right whoever goes left has to be fast my guess too where wade reiben i want you to listen closely to jackson this is the way to gripe jackson continue id love to hear it you didnt volunteer jackson no three brothers of his were killed in action command wants him out of there a paratrooper named ryan hes going home if hes alive how about that jeep a halftrack anything whitewalls i changed my mind i teach english at addley high school in addley pennsylvania thats better but youve still got a long way to go talk to reiben hes a natural and works at it hell give you some pointers there you go again thats whining thats not okay upham youve got to learn the difference between whining and griping you cant just rely on natural ability youve got to study and practice sure you got one those are tigers they have sixinch armor they dont even notice grenades those guns are close you dont count same place we are plenty what do they know i had nine but i feel through the ice when i was seven my brother pulled me out then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily it was a dud i figure one on the beaches one on the cliffs and two getting here dont need it im a cat ive got five lives a machine gun thank him and tell him were sorry about his loss did he see any sign of them i dont expect to live that long ill tell you what if im still alive when it hits fivehundred ill let you know and well split the money some it seemed appropriate ive been humming it it looks like a renoir you think the rest of us were sarge upham like i said it was nothing dont bunch up it was nothing dashes across the street glad of it thats not all there were nine gunners on the eightyeights one had a broken heel on his boot two had bratwurst for supper last night one of them is named fritz the other hans maybe i dont know its hard to tell forward forward now reverse reiben i dont know what id do without you sarge keep ryan close to you and alive out of the mouth of babes were going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else well if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo we might stand a chance but not against those tanks sarge see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable but thats my personal brand of stupidity i feel kind of proprietary about it if you do it again youre busted thanks for drawing that machine gun off me dont let yourself get killed if you do they might make me give back the medal and then i wont be able to lip off to colonels anymore you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve youre the last one still alive no but if i get any worse youll have to relieve me i think youre right keith thats the rub i liked wade whos ryan if theyre both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other how do i choose look at my hand there it goes again simple numbers every time you kill one of your men you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two three ten a hundred others we lost what thirtyone on the cliffs ill bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns thats over three hundred men maybe five hundred a thousand then thousand any number you want see its simple it lets you always choose mission over men not in so many words but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men dont have good morale its not worth a damn so if youre scared or empty or halfastep from a section eight do you tell your men of course not you bluff you lie it could be worse you know the first thing they teach you at ocs lie to your men no problem a pair of deuces less so what i bluff it used to tear me apart when id get one of my men killed but what was i supposed to do break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do of course not so i bluffed and after a while i started to fall for my own bluff it was great it made everything so much easier sarge is that why your hands been shaking shes the best poker player you ever saw my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt finally my mother gave him an ultimatum either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down she never lost she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands and he bluffs he had sixteen levels of bullshit her eyes the tone of her voice her bets her jokes the way she sipped her coffee she was a master she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game every saturday night my father would lose two three hundred bucks and shed win it all back and then some and id stand there glued to her shoulder from the time i was five years old watching every hand every move studying how she did it thats why im such a good officer i can look at a mans face and tell you exactly what hes holding and if its a shit hand i know just what cards to deal him you know why im such a good officer because of my mother have i ever told you about her yeah vecchio i couldnt remember his name he was a good kid remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze what was the name of that kid at anzio the one who got his face burned off lets just find someplace snatches the morphine from sarge quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot hes done this before more morphine hurry up come on come on shoves the needle into wades neck thick vein pumps the morphine straight to wades brain motions impatiently to sarge about to pour his sulfa sees the wound stops knows its fatal rolls to his feet fire another burst kills the last of the german riflemen doesnt pause runs onto the field how about you shut up and take your position how about you take your position yeah what rule of thumb is that ill be alright no it comes and goes it stops when i look at it a couple of weeks it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading it doesnt take this now youre the one kidding yourself hell of a mission you never know if we stayed we could make a difference command isnt going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell arent going to let them surrender they guys here arent going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up theyre fine as long as they can gripe theyll be alright nope since when have things been normal maybe tell that to private james ryan weve got our orders lets go thats not what were here for push yep hell of a mission a fucking mess two maybe three kraut divisions no fronts no lines the drops were completely fouled up weve got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place trying to hang on command says we hold st mere but north of that its all krauts even if ryans where hes supposed to be hes more than likely dead somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundredandfirsts radios the night before the drop not one of them works were going in blind now weve got a straight shot due north to ramelle twentysix miles two villages between here and there st mere then bernay well take the jeep as far as we can then go on on foot ive got a line on one what about talbot okay wade translators i want reiben on bar jackson with his sniper rifle beasley demolition simpson some private up there lost three brothers got a ticket home i wish you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission dont need to the krauts go that covered worked didnt it i thought you were my mother go goddamn it knows what that means he hears the rumble of the tanks fires a burst more germans drop here they come hears the faint distant rumble of the tank barely has time to react sees i wonder if his cabin is still available i coach the baseball team too get back to your positions here they come cocks his thompson settles down behind some sandbags see to it lets hope because were sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here youre goddamned right i give the order vote jesus christ listen to me you little pissant pieces of shit i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes is that clear youre only allowed to shoot at germans thats one of the rules i have no fucking idea here we come cover me on the bridge were coming in scans the germans with his binoculars thats a mystery to me has anyone ever told you youre officer material but we accomplish the mission i dont like that one except for the last part that ones not bad whys that well now im saying were moving out get off your ass up were moving out is silent motionless he gently closes wades eyes his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags he fumbles and drops it sarge notices we cant leave it here ill make a note of your suggestions but ill leave that last one to you especially if hes already dead any further thoughts on the subject but i am a captain if i were not a captain i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a topnotch poker player which i am having learned at the side of my mother who is by popular acclaim the best poker player in in addition as i pointed out earlier i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products when we arrive there to see if they live up to their excellent reputation moreover i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and im more than willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men especially you reiben to help relieve her suffering the men thoroughly enjoy the performance reiben whats the matter with you i dont gripe to you im a captain theres a chain of command griping goes one way up only up never down you gripe to me i gripe to my superior officers up get it i dont gripe to you i dont gripe in front of you how long you been in the army you have orders too reiben theres a fairly good chance youre not going to die at all never mind dont worry well pick up this kid hightail it back to division everythingll work out fine ours is not to reason why sure what do you want to know upham are you sure youve never been in combat stands on the edge of the woods almost in a trance well i for one like cheese theres always a bright side theres to be a bright side look for it yeah how so sure reiben trust me youre the best sorry i need a bar man youre the best strides through the chaos avoiding the passing vehicles he sees his men and walks toward them reiben hurries up to miller pleading stay at it until you get fire control keep em down wait for the navy theres a war on good chance theyre not still making lingerie in caen reiben how the hell do you know so much about lingerie dont worry were the only rangers this side of the continent weve got to be first into caen sure meet me at the top well start the paperwork sarge he was the best friend i ever had lem me tell you about sarge jackson was from west fork tennessee he was going to be a preacher his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson upham good kid smart he was writing a book yes private races through the debris trailed by bullets doesnt move he just stares at sarges body struggling with a pair of germans you set sarge nods dont do that again no private i want you to stay here keep your head down dont do anything brave or stupid alright come with me yeah yeah i want you right next to me no matter where i go you understand the hell you arent youre comin with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way you hear me private this bridge can not be held the germans have two companies less than three miles from here they have tanks private im sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isnt going to helpjackson how many times i got to tell you youre from tennessee what deal well ill be goddamned i knew it nope he aint wade i guess i mean ryan what do you think of him what do you think hell no yall come back of course sir hes right we cant shoot himwell we could but wed get in an enormous amount of trouble and hes right about the bridge its a hell of a lot more important than he is looks like a flaming asshole to me you know what the best possible thing that could happen is the hell he didnt you shut up this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of goddamned ryan fuck the little bastard fuck private james ryan fuck him just fuck the goddamned sonofa bitch wade sarge corporal insect all of us hell ill bet even the captain has a mother they got squirrels there too right you know what a bar weighs nineteen and a half pounds not counting ammo and you think these things are comfortable they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each thats thirtysix pounds right there if we find ryan and hes still alive that sonofabitch is gon na carry this goddamned bar back to the beach for me hell no i think hes the best officer in the whole goddamned army bar none no ones gon na win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian they assembled him at ocs out of spare body parts from dead gis i know this for a fact jackson more tanks ryan lots of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation they know that they are dead men they settle into their positions and prepare to fire and die continues firing cutting down the advancing germans fires a burst germans drops thats not where i am miller no where are you what deal goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it opens up with the machine gun leave him to me captain ill have him pissing and moaning with the best of us maybe caen yes sir of course sir i was merely speaking hypothetically if this was a voting situation then the vote would have been unanimous but of course its not a voting situation youre the captain and you give the orders sir have it your way captain what if our guys open up sir looks like theyve been having a hell of a party here captain looks like tea time maybe theyre brits no sir maybe but what if he dies on the way back you see what im saying sir the best possible situation is hes dead we find his body more or less intact we grab one of his dogtags and hightail it back to the beach or better yet we head over to caen and catch up with division neither do i sir c and this is the worst one we find ryan and hes wounded not only does he not carry my gear we have to carry his gear and him b ryan is dead hes been blown up by the german equivalent of wade whose name i know you dont want me to mention theres nothing to find the biggest piece is the size of a pea we wander around looking for him until the germans pick us off one after another well sir consider the possibilities a ryan is alive we have to take him back to the beach knowing you you dont let him carry my gear even though he really should and we all get killed trying to keep him alive ive given this a lot of thought sir the best thing that could happen is we find ryan and hes dead i thought you said we had an hour sir goddamn itgoddamn itgoddamn it sir ive got an idea lets go around yes sir as a final note id like to say fuck our orders fuck ramelle fuck the cheese capital of france and while were at it fuck private james ryan sir if you were not a captain i would compliment you now for being an excellent liar im sorry sir i apologize but if you werent a captain or if i were a major what would you say well maybe not the captain but the rest of us have mothers easy for you to say sir fucking james ryan id like to wring his fucking neck id much rather die in caen than ramelle sir its a personal thing huh well sir in purely arithmetic terms since when does six equal one whats the sense in risking six guys to save one captain could you please explain the math of this mission to me jesus christ hes a natural general gavin is going to be very irritated at you captain im listening sir sir you know what ramelle is famous for cheese the rest of the company is going to caen and were going to the goddamned cheese capital of france there is no bright side i should be on my way to caen sir its like beethoven the guys one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf go figure i mean whod he piss off and here i am the beethoven of ladies foundation garments one step away from caen the center of the known lingerie universe and instead im going to ramelle to save some fucking private whos probably already dead captain i got ta tell you the irony of this mission is fucking killing me where are you planning on putting private ryan sir captain can i ask you a question but sir no im not kaback is honest or what about faulkner or that little guy with the glasses please sir you cant take me to ramelle i got ta go to caen sir please i told you they make caen lingerie there its beautiful its the best there is itsoh please sir i dont think so captain oh captain theyll always make lingerie its

there cold as death he drinks the poison he dies by her side and then she wakes and sees him dead i have not said all by malign fate the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friars plan

the playhouse is for dreamers look where the dream has brought us thou needst not to be gone wilt thou be gone it is not yet near day it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree believe me love it was the nightingale nono you can not marry wessex oh my love you ran from me before i was the more deceived my love is no lie i have a wife yes and i can not marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that and yet you let me come to your bed he was not dead before i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come marlowes touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations a literary feud quite normal i know how to fight then i will go with you to be the wife of a poor playercan i wish that for lady viola except in my dreams and yet i would if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day you can not not for the queen herself in heaven perhaps it is not a comedy i am writing now a broad river divides my loversfamily duty fateas unchangeable as nature i found something in my sleep the friar who married them will take up their destinies oh but it is mine too good night good night as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied

drink for one kiss i would defy a thousand wessexes yes by god love knows nothing of rank or riverbank it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king and their love should be minded by each for love denied blights the soul we owe to god so tell my lady william shakespeare waits for her in the garden oh thomas a pair of pippins as round and rare as golden apples constantly without doubt and plays the lute she has a natural ear and her bosomdid i mention her bosom deeper softer none of your twittering larks i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song oh thomas her lips the early morning rose would wither on the branch if it could feel envy oh if i could write the beauty of her eyes i was born to look in them and know myself like a sickness and its cure together your aunt no and yet she does where the ink has run with tears was she weeping when she gave you this she loves me thomas and break her heart and mine she tells me to keep away she is to marry lord wessex what should i do of course you have not i have not written it he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet do you understand me let me see you take off your hat wait there where did you learn how to do that take off your hat your name you are on my ground marlowe oh yes he is the one lovely waistcoat shame about the poetry a theatre poet a man my lord oh my lord you will not shake me off she never needed me more i sear by your breeches her chaperone my ladys country cousin my but you be a handsome gallant just as she said you may call me miss wilhelmina here we come at last my lord christopher marlowe at your service how do i offend my lord i was a poet till now but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the towerdr levine please return to your seat your civil rights have been overridden please dr levine calm down dr levine fletcher now get out of there fletcher get away from there fletcher i want you back here fletcher what are you doing out there pull it damn it now do it norman its the only choice we have this thing is gon na crush us do you see it its either that or we grow gills increase positive pressure hes right beneath us why cant i what the hell is going on here thirty yards sure each time it started fires inside the habitat forty yards it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface but weve never used it underwater before were a habitat not a castle the only defense we have is high voltage fifty yards and closing a squid the size of a whale i dont think so target acquired sixty yards directions east coming shut up beth i dont want to hear it youre a fucking biochemist arent you cant you tell us something nobody move nobody move there are procedures beth that i want followed my procedures and considering whats going on i want you to follow them very closely back at the door i asked you to back away they told me about sixty hours the surface ships will be back after the storm clears edmunds do you have a 20 on norman what are you his mother get norman i want everyone ready to go edmunds the subs yeasts thank you beth but i dont think were gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread alright beth do that thing you did before what is it i said back away back away then basic english theres no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet of what were able to measure roughly twentysix hundred feet pull it you see the lever on the green box upper right hand corner ted go into the control room listen for my instructions what the hell it shut us down going active no i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat he might be listening now bullshit whats out there isnt alien its an animal you think he killed edmunds i dont want you talking to jerry if something should happen to us the navy will at least have partial records of what happened edmunds can you copy damn it edmunds edmunds you dont think weapons are important great okay ask him about his weapons what am i a dog now he translated it wrong my name is jerry its like see spot run without a cautionary word to anyone you know ted said something to me earlier i think hes right he said when you got a guy who if he wasnt here hed be standing in the unemployment line you got ta question if you got the right guy and then brought her down here you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation so you knew this when you wrote your report when was this she shouldve known better i think i do how drastic no buts if he wants to be left well leave him hello yes the subs i want a report hello yes a report gim me shit i told you people nobody goes anywhere unless i say hes here somewhere find him the subs on its way go cmon what do you mean hes missing just worry about yourself look the ships are clearing out theyre taking us topside in a matter of minutes someone can check him out there if its that imprtant dont get hysterical norman everything can be killed you mean whats in that thing is immortal like thou shall not kill what i dont know but its something alien what is it norman its a corrosive gas on earth it makes a halfeaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly iron rust on an oldsmobile at a pressure this low oxygen becomes toxic breathe it down here and itll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile they pressurize us with helium your reports become our bible down here dr johnson weve been carrying out each of your recommendations one by one to the smallest detail the one you recommended in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration we think it might thats why we brought you here weve assembled your team theyre waiting for us now off the record i dont mind telling you this thing scares the shit out of me im afraid it is dr johnson because its sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor extraordinary isnt it maybe older dating the crash at least that old coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year see this coral geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick as best we can estimate it crashed four hundred years ago something like that that doesnt surprise you what survivors no i wouldnt think so a thousand feet a cyclones on its way in i thought they would have told you on the phone were moving fast considering the storm well we dont have all the facts yet good securitys been our biggest worry now that youre here we can shut this thing down tight you talk to any reporters any press anything else what have you been told so far come with me the teams already waiting dont thank me dr johnson you werent my choice the pentagon made me take you captain edmunds get in here i need you for this norman get out of there now norman theyve left keep watching well where the fuck is he what the hell is going on here fuck him what hello any sign of harry theyre coming send them damn it i know but im not gon na be held responsible get him out of there i thought i told you people what caused it well shit find something do something make something up thank you i can see that try something else can you open that panel she wired this system edmunds get in here i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted with an o harold with an o im in charge what not now beth please i want to know who were talking to before we start talking wheres edmunds are you enjoying yourself harry because i dont know what the hell youre doing ignorant the things ignorant how do you mean strange whats the message were all very proud of you harry but what the hell is it who is that wheres that coming from gim me a report i want just tell me worst case worst case of what we might find you dont know that or it could contain some great benefit to us some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind so whats the problem the what so how do we get it open a break for what what so do we and it seems to have picked up something on its travels yes harry i did i dont know how it can be chipped but its chipped its chipped im not saying anything harry im just stating the facts the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy built into an epoxy resin honeycomb the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented to the craft none not a scratch in the dome hanger all our tapes are transferred to the sub its on a 12 hour timer if someone doesnt reset the delay button the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes resetting the sub well until we know exactly what it is nobody goes outside understood it wont register its too big to image the sensors are picking up something outside edmunds its not talking its mimicking i am not gon na explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named jerry i want a name a real name this things full name rank and serial number from the sphere get out of there i dont want anyone going anywhere outside understood internal power they switched us over were on the bottom of the fucking ocean he cant just walk outside how can he be missing ted shut up are you packed ready to go i want everyone packed now what no i know theyre civilians but what does it do this sphere what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back we had considered it what do you make of this radiation shield you think what is it ted get her away from the door what about a crowbar duly noted ted edmunds try using suction nobody goes inside until we know whats inside the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft weve seenif the technology of that sphere is advanced enough the way it functions is gon na appear to us like magic shes not gon na know what you want me to retype it hes saying take me to your leader he wants to know whos in charge shes not gon na know sir he understands me fine its not ignorant i have to tell you its strange spiralling out of the center you see g is one b is two h is three and so on when i got the message its a single sequence repeated over and over please watch your closest monitor ladies and gentlemen lets say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us just like we are to say medieval europe suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set there wouldnt be any place to plug it in it could but the odds of it being any use to us are against it its nonsense theres enough difference between our own species to prove that man is man all he knows is man and all he can think of is what he knows the anthropomorphic problem good norman ted seems to have some ideas to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere no they dont represent a message they arent decorative at all they have another purpose entirely we know how this craft got here where its been ted captain then how can it be chipped i thought you said there wasnt any damage done in the crash chipped the door how can it be chipped right so youre saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch how much damage wont make any difference the tapes document everything theyre going to want answers and theyre going to keep asking until they get them yes you are youre staring at me why are you looking at me like that another attack just in time for what in time for what yeah i dont know how you could make that confusion thats a hell of a mistake to make beth we never even had a conversation norman i never said that cannibalism to be extreme and now were talking about a new life form their values and ethics may be incomprehensible a light switch a button opened that door the craft runs on some sort of power its an american spacecraft youd have to ask them for who the fish pry the thing open what are we neanderthals you mean forget we all kill ourselves bad joke sorry beth no i dont but i always said to myself when i die i want to die laughing hows that working out by the way its not fast enough norman theres a helluva lot of explosive down there less than a minute were never gon na make it well press something you know how to work this thing im trying there her legs are in the way gim me a second cmon norman three fiftysix three fiftyfive three hurry norman four minutes missed push her cmon i cant reach her how far aways the sub how much time you figure to get to the surface were never gon na make it fine i could hit her a little harder more toward the cranium did i kill her stop what what are you what is it is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag the three of us dont have to watch itll do it for you navy transmission theyre sent from wisconsin wisconsins your answer shes lying norman just like she lied about fixing your suit i was just in the cafeteria theres plenty of food in there take a look for yourself shes cracking norman i thought she was with you her suits gone when i woke up nobody was here what happened to her youre clear you see the airlock norman where are you you there norman i dont remember much its like my memory is on the tip of my tongue but i cant taste any of it funny my senses are much keener though purer hearing seeing smelling like i can smell your sheets norman you tried to wash it out earlier but i can still smell the urine dont worry im not going to tell the others its normal really isnt it in a crisis the stress the panic did i dont do this dont psychoanalyze me i hate squid period just like you hate jellyfish theres some sort of pattern here itll take a minute what are they i could never read that far i never wanted to what happens on page 87 have you ever read page 87 norman you dont understand about the sphere you were all supposed to leave you werent supposed to stay down here what are you still doing here its like what is that that noise curious isnt it whats inside before i die id sure like to open it and see then what norman you mean you think im cracking am i gim me another explanation meaning were never gon na get to the surface alive to tell anyone so we know we know it went through a black hole we saw it norman when wed get to the surface wed tell someone about the black hole wouldnt we itd go in some report like some big discovery so in fifty years when they build that ship theyd make precautions for a black hole but they didnt the called it an unknown entry event on that flight recorder they called the black hole an unknown entry event they didnt know what a black hole was fifty years from now men are going to build that ship in a very tentative experimental way with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible im completely serious there is something very important missing from that spacecraft you know what that is and were just talking about three dimensional creatures what if its five or six or sevendimensional so dimensional that we couldnt even see it to kill it everything ever written about extra terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human if it doesnt look human its a reptile or a big insect or something having human values human understanding our present this spacecraft was designed to pick things up they see things they want these claws go out and bring it in they come across this this sphere find it interesting curious they draw it inside to take back home this answers one of our questions time travel a black hole our answer nice work norman cmon norman cmon go ahead ladies first you sound defensive dont be defensive you holding up alright how are you feeling norman its like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer hed run screaming witchcraft and you couldnt explain it to him either modems microchips particle physics good idea ted we are friends codes are for hiding information so its making a mistake its making a code without intending to i figured its probably substituting numbers for letters then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard and since were getting spirals i imagined the keyboard as a spiral so i translated it i asked myself why would the sphere be using a code if youre trying to communicate why use a code if it is a message its probably a substitution code ill work on it well if its a discharge salts good for you ted helps you from getting impotent look closely that isnt writing those are grooves not where when 400 years ago from our future it didnt fly here it arrived here meaning it didnt land in the water we take a weeny little wedge bang on it a couple of times and bust off a chunk of the metal yet any spacecraft even at a low velocity say 200 miles an hour crashes into the water its gon na be like hitting concrete it would crumple like paper but there isnt a dent to be seen anywhere not even a scratch its been obvious from the start hasnt it captain thats why all the secrecy why no one was told about it save your breath its not an alien spacecraft do you all the facts you need are right in front of you think about it is it a spacecraft half a mile long with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it someone went to a lot of trouble try again you dont think it does i think its rather obvious thats right shutup ted you didnt notice shit keep hammering easy ted were not mining gold youre not afraid of the water are you norman just one of normans many secrets she told me what you said norman norman thinks we shouldnt be going down thinks its a mistake to who arthur nothing nothing that norman doesnt already knowi see it yes sir im here jerry please stop this jerry maybe so but i think we need to ask jerry about it yes i do whatevers out there i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier but sir i think its imperative i think the messages the animals weve seen what killed edmunds the reading you got earlier i think theyre all related at least our obituaries will be accurate thats reassuring what for it raises a very serious question what happens if jerry gets mad because if jerry is powerful and also emotional i think we should be careful consider his emotional response thats smart lets talk about guns and violence the message doesnt show a lack of intelligence its smart its approaching us in a simple way like you would a dog holding out your hand letting it sniff get used to you i didnt know it would come to this wait a second at the time i dont know i thought putting her on the list it might help her career catch her a break 81 i think she tried again five years ago i thought you should know she put a razor to her wrists a day later a while back beth and i we worked at the same university she was assisting a chemist there i forget his name doing research experiments she was also living with him yeah i know and when she finished her work he kicked her out broke off the relationship and published five papers all her work without any thank you or acknowledgement you dont want to know im not paranoid i know beth she can be drastic but sir you cant just leave harry down here sir hes missing hes gone he left harrys missing all im saying is someone should keep an eye on him im telling you harrys lost it hes saying theres a deathwish out for each of us i dont know thats the point or maybe it cant be killed if it is alien maybe we shouldnt try to open it at all maybe we shouldnt picked up something what is it take a look whats wrong with oxygen but sir i dont understand this report these recommendations theyre for an encounter with extra terrestrial life ulf report nobodys mentioned that in years you mean someone actually read it what team it doesnt make any sense its impossible theres got to be some mistake here a four hundred year old military spacecraft theres no such thing our space program isnt even forty years old hold on wait a second geologists not really no something of the military crashes in the ocean it explains why there was nothing on the news why youve kept everything a secret when did it crash what is it a military spacecraft like a shuttle or satellite what do you need me for then why am i here a thousand an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water i dont want to sound pessimistic here but i assume there are no survivors how deep is he they didnt tell me anything storm what storm from what whats with all the security press no i havent nothing else the usual plane crash survivers unknown routine stuff really what team the pentagon i didnt know i had friends in washington well thanks for the opportuninty here my wife appreciates it captain right forgive me thank you colonel down below harry said we would all have to die since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible and we all knew then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone death was the only logical explanation but sitting here we still know so how is that possible unless we make ourselves forget yes and i think we already know it will beth hear what what lets get out of here beth lets go home cmon beth gim me the gun i i know youre too strong beth beth stop it then wheres it coming from beth stop it where is it coming from beth beth dont fuck with me beth get away from the door beth its not safe for you to be either dont beth please

manifested that beth thats when you went in the sphere but youre lying beth youre losing it cmon someone did then why beth why go in why put out explosives why manifest the snakes he cant manifest against what harrys unconscious hes not a threat why did you go in the sphere beth did you are you manifesting them do you fear them what are they doing down here in the bathroom suddenly appearing you know what i mean how do you feel about snakes you put explosives around the habitat i cant imagine what youd put in a drink you think id really drink that im feeling better your watch the grooves around the door theyve shifted and the pattern the fluids they look darker now the sphere looks different where are you not believing you im sorry thirty years ago in residency i passed out you you want to kill him beth doesnt say what wait isnt that dangerous three to six hours 20 ccs of parasolutrine in combination with 6 ccs of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures no cardiac side effects rem activity is surpressed its like a sleeping pill whats that paraso parasolutrine damn it chloramphenicol riordan bingo tarazine does it cause drowsiness thats all we need to get him unconscious put him under sintag valdomet ephedrine hydrochloride diphenyl parlene looks like some sort of code must be and if it is its a part of him not even he can control no i mean weve always believed we can think anything we want without consequences you ever read the bible it talks about our sinful nature you know i mean we can think and believe and desire whatever we want but theres a part of us a shadow side as jung called it that cant be controlled its evil its inside us its what we are he must not realize he is like the navy crewman harry was sleeping then he mustve manifested his dream its his fear the squid hes manifesting his fears making them real i dont know beth im not the fucking alien that built the thing but it can when harry came out of the sphere he mumbled something about page 87 how he would never read that far he was too scared to then you found the book remember in your lab then in the cafeteria and page 87 talks about a giant squid i dont know he acquired some sort of power a power to manifest things when did the messages start the animals outside start showing up after harry came out of the sphere remember when we first spoke to jerry barnes kept asking for jerrys real name but harry never would he didnt because he was afraid the screen would say harry instead of jerry we werent talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry we were talking to harry or a part of harry he translated it wrong created brought to life i dont know but at the end jerry said stop calling me jerry and after the attack a navy guy woke me up i dont know i thought he was an illusion but i checked the tape and jerry said he manifested him according to calculations of some naturalists one of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles 27 feet long that would make a formidable monster our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long some skeletons of squids page 87 i could never read that far page 87 i dont know beth i wasnt there this being after you so carefully fixed my suit all i know is i opened that refridgerator you think did you look it was on the top shelf 1800deepsea delivery i hear theyre good we mustve had it delivered then its a pretty common place to look for food when you dont think you have any the refridgerator fixing it i think so beth yes he what yeah well i get that way when im facing death and someone deserts me what are you doing in the ship beth still clear my air isnt im coming back you fixed this suit beth i cant see anything how does it look still clear but i dont know how you fixed my suit i would but my suit in case you die too why should i go four days wake him then lets go get outta you me and harry its not worth the risk forget the sub where are you going in such a hurry beth beth i didnt hold it together alright dont do this beth what its done alright its over and theres not a damn thing we can do about it now okay calm down beth alright you went through edmunds things where did you get this youre jumping to conclusions beth dont get worked up so what cmon beth dont make this personal he told me himself they were taking us back what are they what could have done this i cant feel her bones shes like a sponge beth beth beth they are or they arent which is it beth and you didnt tell anyone you knew about the squid not being normal before fletcher went out there wait a minute what do you mean not normal me well i was wrapped in seaweed it itched for a while but i survived beth do you find it curious that were seeing all this life down here nothing and then these enormous flocks of squid then jellyfish yeah it was awful when i was six my younger brother and i we went swimming in the pacific at my mothers beach house we both felt stinging and when we came out of the water he was wearing jellyfish head to toe killed him no thank you i hate jellyfish we have a library whered this come from disrupt our brain waves interfere with our ability to think get this thing off me 400 years ago im sure christopher columbus wouldve loved these accomodations no go ahead really ladies first yeah drowning what are you threatening me the timing has never seemed quite right it never occurred to me we cant go down there were not prepared that deep that takes years of training beth were just scientists lab scietists we wear ties and lab coats to work not oxygen tanks underwater wait down where cmon beth that reports like the blind leading the blind i spent a week reading sagan and watching reruns of the twilight zone seriously i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house i had no idea its bullshit the reports a joke that ulf report everybodys patting me on the back about beth look can i trust you with a little secret is it coming from our own computer wheres it coming from when did it come across it would erase all our knowledge of it all of our power the power allows us to manifest our fears right what if we feared the power to go away there is one possibility good thank you now that i have it on why are you laughing you dont even know what that means nine hundred feet to surface wait no idea get her out of the seat i need room to sit harry you got her just pull her down like inside harry work with me here im trying to keep balance with shut up and catch i heard i heard hold on are you trying damn it just im trying shit here catch her hold on two and a half minutes once were in the sub shut up and open the door help me lift her i dont think so its the squid stop it you know what it is harry thats right we just figured you know the three of us we need to work together through this how do we decode it wisconsin but why would she you didnt say that about the food beth left she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me what do you mean shes not here thank you my suit beth said she fixed it i cant breathe am i clear harry you dont remember that you said something to me before about how we were all going to die have you looked outside jellyfish everywhere i hate jellyfish harry what happened in the cafeteria getting anywhere with those these arent half bad fletcher you might have a second career coming that far in what harry page 87 of what harry what is it harry then explain it to me tell me about the door do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere harry you remember opening the door harry can you tell me about the sphere what noise its whats in that sphere isnt it harry whatever you think is in that thing you think its going to kill you no i didnt say that look were under a lot of pressure were tired youre not thinking straight i cant if i had a minute to think maybe but i know youre wrong i cant believe that harry meaning were never gon na get the chance to tell anyone so what i dont follow you not a clue dont be so optomistic harry good point i dont know what youre talking about but good point i mentioned it in my report didnt you read the report but on the way home they miss their turn go too far into the past which one let me get the list out to what whatever i can do to help look would you wait a second i no why dont im fine im not being defensive fine im fine what about the time paradox how we were all going to die that there was no way we would make it out of here alive that whole time i couldnt stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier beth and harry how are the others the ships does this mean what i think it means told me what what report really captain who no they didnt say just that careful its heavy what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash geologists at a plane crash whos everyone know what what report what report youve heard of me im in psychology was still am really just been a while i treat aircrash survivors of course he did hes been isloated for 400 years he wants someone to talk to look you put a human being in isolation for four days they can become neurotic sometimes psychotic were talking about 400 years here an alien that shows emotional responses i think we need to address him before he reacts further im not sure has harry spoken with jerry what was it frankly ted id be much happier if jerry was just a cold emotionless intellect when he uses a phrase like i am happy i think we should think twice about what we ask him well hes polite well how about we wait and see what harry comes up with the creature this is like nursery school please ted i dont see anything you mean a picture like what earth doesnt have a patent on buttons ted you want me to try he wasnt feeling well i dont know what keep watching the news are you watching the news four four years dont be so supportive honey he didnt say much at all honey you seen my suitcasewhat sub what was edmunds doing outside too big what what is that dont make stuff up these emotional theories just so you can feel important here give him a chance hes speaking our language not the other way around captain i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions whats inside the sphere she says jellyfish are a delicacy you know i never knew that to what sir about leaving did you hear me sir because can i stay sir im willing to risk it i am after what we just witnessed maybe its a message of some sort you know see this red here maybe we didnt want to come back time travel i always thought it was one of those myths like santas reindeer considered what that its american how would you think its american whats wrong a foot and a half thick thatd withstand a helluva lot of radiation some sort of lead or something look at this what are you going to do shoot her what if we go out there you know wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open id also like it noted captain you know i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television a half a mile long he doesnt wait for an answer by the bunks well whats your theory it doesnt make any sense well theyre not mine no i dont think so pussy dont gim me that psychology bullshit norman psychology isnt a science its superstition its a bunch of soft subjective theories without any hard data to back it up with an intellect like this emotions dont mean shit thank you whatd you say see no code whatd i say yeah ill work on it too its not a discharge right edmunds you said before right so its got ta be a message impotent im not impotent hey go easy on the salt will ya were not a bunch of icy streets here looks like a design some writing maybe maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message arrived from where please it must have flown here meaning an american spacecraft half a mile long and buried 400 years yeah good theory harry if it is an alien spacecraft gim me a minute here i think ive got it unless this alien spacecraft was you know somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable why would this ship carry instructions in english but its impossible is it some sort of joke like one of those hoaxes english alot like you know i noticed it before but i didnt gim me some room here will you back off gim me some space its just like swimming norman you know how to swim dont you what is it harry what does norman already know whatd you say to him jerry isnt hostile norman he said earlier we were his friends you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds with whats out there not that i know of why barnes didnt know couldnt get a reading whys that you want to put him on your couch norman grill him about his childhood unless its an act sure why not give him the trophy that pretentious son of a bitch you heard him norman all that someone went to a lot of trouble try again bullshit and impotent where does he get off saying im impotent hes a fucking selfrighteous little prick inside the sphere look thats the vertical torso three legs two arms theres no head so im guessing the creatures head is located within the torso itself you know dont you see it its a picture of the creature try this one squint harder take a look i rearranged the numbers put em up to the light go ahead squint at it its not some fucking substitution code its a direct visual representation hes manic norman you know that this reliance on harry is misplaced you hear me totally misplaced hes overlooking things obvious things still make a note i recognized that strange isnt it you know how it would have a button youre a 53 year old shrink what are you gon na do hes a pussyid rather be with mommy mommys marrying rache i dont want to be lady godiva anymore no matter how much i like chocolate i want to be a stud i killed her quotthose who travel far and near this will make you

some help we have the kids this weekend so i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition i might not be back until saturday yeh its cheaper i didnt want to spoil our supper we have to talk it was a veal stock i thido it istormi musicwagner cue music sweep the harbor were not watching the sea what have we missed all prop cars accounted for give me a shot from trumans ring what happened down there whats on the clockcam why wasnt i told any unpredictable behavior has to be reported is that the best shot we can get why is he in the basement no hold back weve learnt about life as truman has and despite the complaints of a minority its been an overwhelmingly positive experience for truman and for the viewing public ive been tempted but i think its important to retain objectivity i wouldnt want to get emotionally caught up we accept the reality of the world with which were presented as the show expanded naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep truman in seahaven demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk theres nothing on the show i dont use myself yes everything you see on the show is for sale from the actors wardrobe food products to the very homes they live in people forget it takes the ipopulationi of an entire country to keep the show running thats correct in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies the casting of a show determined by an air date he was the one who arrived on cue he was curious from birth premature by two weeks as if he couldnt wait to get started let me demonstrate some examples as with our own lives the only people he cant cast are his family otherwise he has final approval able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend marlon or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player certainly a nomination we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort havent you ever watched your child or your lover sleep not only does he give us a glimpse of the truth he gives us a glimpse of ourselves i prefer to think of it as a mirror weve become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions bored with pyrotechnics and special effects while the world he inhabits is counterfeit theres nothing fake about truman himself no scripts no cue cards its not always shakespeare but its genuine thats how he can support an entire channel it has to be the reality as you know ratings have never been our primary goal i imagine well lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing trumans latest torment however im certain that our core audience will remain loyal amnesia that and a fat new contract since kirk started this whole crisis in trumans life i came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it a dead one at that we ihavei had our close calls in the past thank you truman ive watched you your whole life i saw you take your first step your first word your first kiss i know you better than you know yourself youre not going to walk out that door iyoui were real thats what made you you so good to watch youre the star a show that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions im the creatorlets take another call london england youre on tru talk the hague for christofthe haguelost them hollywood california youre on tru talk youve never actually met truman yourself never thought about doing a cameoplaying a veterinarian or a priest something like that why do you feel that trumans never come close to discovering the true nature of his world and its all available in the truman show catalogue operators are standing by all products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value no of course not and since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement and the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country who knew that a show originally meant to last one year bringing up baby would turn into a cradle to grave concept he is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation of course his eagerness to leave his mothers womb also meant he was the one selected we should remind viewers that truman especially as a child presented a challenge for the production istanbul turkey youre on with master videographer christof of course truman has always been very much in on casting are we talking emmies lets go to some of those viewers calls but how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when truman sleeps a window onto the human condition but recent events have been so dramatic it does raise the perennial question what keeps us watching this one man twentyfour hours a day eating sleeping working sitting for hours in contemplation lets talk ratings truman has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few dayshow do you hope to sustain that audience now that truman appears to have reconciled himself of course how idoi you intend to explain his twenty two year absence i understand hes hardly had a life of his own since he left the show how did you convince himwas it the opportunity to be close to truman again and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role i really must congratulate you on writing kirk back in a master stroke of course there hasnt been anything to compare with this the first time an intruder has been a former cast member the catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course trumans father kirk and his infiltration onto the show before we discuss that its worth reminding viewers that this isnt the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach truman welcomethe thing that started all of this not the whole thing truman you were right about one thing and the last thing id ever do is lie to you think about it truman if everybodys in on it id have to be in on it too im not in on it because there is no iiti its a lot of world for one man you sure thats not wishful thinking you wishing youd made something more of yourself christ truman who hasnt sat on the john and had an imaginary interview on seahaven tonight who hasnt wanted to be somebody truman its me marlon i need to talk to you really thats the big guy quite a paintbrush hes got i went all over but i never found a place like this look at that sunset truman its perfect no what exactly whatre we doing here truman i told you i cant how about them who your dad no truman if this is another one of your fantasies imixed upi mixed up in what are you okay you look like shit sorry im way behind truman what are you doing here sure its halogen shame it didnt hit you you couldve sued you coming for a drink trust me i figured whats the point i knew id just be taking my problems with me once the kids came along it made me look at seahaven with new eyes i realized what the hell could be better than this im telling you what you really need is someone to carry on the burbank name truman you know i did think about moving away one time nursery so when are you leaving yeah outta whatit doesnt matter ill make other arrangements thats right why

financially along with a sizeable donation to the community maybe a small roadside memorial tell them he was trying to save the young boys life and that he died heroically like the other firemen incinerate it like the others no nowe need to try our vaccine on it how can this be this mans still alive brought on by what youve got something to show me kurtzweil we think mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence hes gone back there again someone has tipped him there are complications its effect on the host has changed the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism its developed a way to modify the host body strughold hes just gotten on a plane in tunis we have a situation the members are assemblingand why do you think it is youre standing here talking to me these people dont make mistakes agent mulder youd be shit out of luck if not for me you saw what you saw because i led you to it im putting my ass on the line for you i told you he and i were old friends ive been using you yeah well i dont have them all that would be my guess what do you think you saw this experiment what you found something you cant somethings gone wrong something unanticipated go back to dallas and dig or youre only going to find out like the rest of the country agent mulder when its too late i think you know the timetable has been set it will happen on a holiday when people are away from their homes when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country the president will declare a state of emergency at which time all federal agencies all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency fema agent mulder the secret government the plague to end all plagues agent mulder a silent weapon for a quiet war the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure theyve been working on this for fifty years while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon what killed those men cant be identified in simple medical terms my god we cant even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv we have no context for what killed those men or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future of how it will be transmitted of the environmental factors involved what killed them i wont even write about i tell you theyd do more than just harass me they have the future to protect when we were young men in the military your father and i were recruited for a project they told us it was biological warfare a virus there were rumors about its origins and are you familiar with fema what the federal emergency management agencys real power is fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency to create a nonelected government think about that what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas according to the newspaper fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus are you familiar with the hanta virus agent mulder i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government the daily newspaper i was right about dallas wasnt i agent mulder i dont either but it sure sells books you know my work for what because im a dangerous man because i know too much about the truth what is it kiddie porn again sexual battery of a patient ive had my license taken away in three states see this bullshit somebody knows im talking to you do you and one little boy michaud was a patriot the men hes loyal to know their way around dallas they blew that building to hide something maybe something even they couldnt predict thats what im saying those people were already dead no they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there which is where the bodies were found but thats the thing whats the question nobodys asking why that building why not the federal building sac darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb i came on my own after reading about the bombing in dallas im a doctor but i think i mentioned that obgyn heard you come here now and again figured youd be needing a little drinky tonight old friend of your fathers my names kurtzweil dr alvin kurtzweil yeah i did no ive been watching your career for a good while back

charade an annoyance to my superiors a joke among my peers spooky they call me spooky mulder whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun shouting to the heavens and anyone wholl listen that the fix is in that our governments hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy that the sky is falling and when it hits its gon na be the shitstorm of all time yup i need your clothes byers they took her scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting when was that penetration but not perforation what am i doing here no dont bother yeah i had an appointment for a pelvic examination whats that im looking for him is this dr kurtzweils residence you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found have you examined them was there anything in those offices that didnt go to dc im looking for anything out of the ordinary maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found your ass i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters youre a liar you lied to me to gather information for you for your goddamn books didnt you you didnt know my father youve been using me you told me you had answers your guess a transportation system transgenic crops the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus what did it look like im not sure a virus yes on the texas border some kind of experiment something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks how can i reach you and they tell me im paranoid negotiating with whom a plague ill know soon enough what killed those men what was it are you saying it wasnt such a small outbreak it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest us several years ago you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency why how dr kurtzweil im not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide i dont believe in the elders of zion the knights templar the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government you mean that apocalyptic trash you write i knew your name was familiar i just didnt know why they want to discredit you for what not according to the men in blue i think youre full of shit youre saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen michaud was a twentytwo year veteran of the bureau before the bomb went off the federal building was too well guarded he just let it explode and whats that well if youve got something to tell me youve got as long as it takes me to hail a cab who sent you you a reporter howd you find me i know the name why you follow me out here for a reason do i know you hows that yes you can youre going to make it scully you got me but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa weve got to keep moving hang on im going to get you out of here scully i think youre in anaphylactic shock scully what what happened you saved me scully as different and frustrating as its been sometimes your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times have kept me honest and made me whole i owe you so much scully and you owe me nothing i dont want to do this without you i dont know if i can if i quit now they win i need you on this scully just like that after what you saw last night after all youve seen you cant just walk away were close to something here were on the verge you cant quit scully what whats wrong i dont know come on run scully maybe maybe not you hear that for the purpose of what not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there very weird i have no idea been where it may be extraterrestrial this virus it yeah well they may this one that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off to hide something bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself were not chasing trucks were chasing evidence what hey i was right about the bomb wasnt i you think they went left where would they be going what are my choices and where are they going with it unmarked tanker trucks what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks no irrigation system somebodys covering their tracks grounds dry about an inch down somebody just laid this down very recently id say this looks like new grass to you and youve never seen anything like that youre sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the firemans body in the morgue this is where he marked on the map scully where he says those fossils were unearthed how was it contracted what did you find you said you werent coming ill have you back for it scully maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away i need you there with me i need your expertise on this the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by scully listen to me im going home then im booking a flight to dallas im getting you a ticket too what kind of infection what did you find why are you whispering were being blamed for these deaths scully i want to know what this man died of dont you i dont know but i have a hunch what youre going to find here isnt anything that can be categorized or easily referenced id been told as much youre telling me the cause of death on the report is false that this man didnt die from an explosion or from flying debris its like jelly according to this tag just get dressed ill explain on the way get dressed scully is that what youd like me to do what are you implying scully i was until about an hour ago why not its three am i wake you youre quitting this isnt about you scully theyre doing this to me they were the ones that put us together why what what are you talking about theyre trying to divide us on this scully we cant let them whatever you told them in there you dont have to protect me somethings not right scully thirteen fifty six thirteen fifty nine thirteen fifty eight thirteen fifty seven scully get somebody to open this door im in the vending room scully i found the bomb alright whatll it be coke pepsi a saline iv panic have you ever seen me panic scully no you didnt its locked what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston i think its free beer night at the astrodome hows that the element of surprise scully random acts of unpredictability if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that can not be programmed categorized or easily referenced what happened to playing a hunch i think they have that covered youre looking for a bomb whats wrong scully did you find something where are you scully thank you they can patch you in through the switchboard well call general mcaddie general mcaddie is who requested our coming here we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately on whose orders were going to the morgue ive got to find scully are we being watched how deep does this go whoever they are this goes right back to dallas it goes right back to the bombing wheres scully i breached protocol i broke contact with the sac i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device if they want someone to blame they can blame me agent scully doesnt deserve this but its not the lives we saved its the lives we didnt and they want to blame us she was with me about what what about you what alien environment how let me out stop the car where is he what happened to kurtzweil why are you telling me this but he sacrificed his own daughter my sister samantha thats why you bombed the building the infected firemen the boy what do you mean walked this is what youve been conspiring to conceal a disease a virus youre lying what is it i want to know where scully is about the conspiracy is she alive wheres scully what happened to kurtzweilwho do they know my lateness may have well been absence a course has already been taken into what who called this meeting is it an emergency yes my life is over go find agent scully save her only her science can save the future the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans weve so assiduously protected for the last fifty years or it may not you have precious little time what ive given you the alien colonists have no idea exists you hold in your hand the power to end the project driver dr kurtzweil is in the trunk as your father knew things need to be sacrificed to the future i thought it only fair you should know given how hard youve worked the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it those vaccinated against it and humanalien hybrids your father arranged for your sisters abduction he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program so that she would survive as a clone he had different hopes for you that you would uncover the truth about the project that you would stop it that you would fight the future imagine our surprise when they began to gestate my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists facilitating their programs to give us access to the virus in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure so that we might save ourselves as the last of the species your father wisely refused to believe this choosing hope over selfishness hope is the only future he had his children the only future any of us have until dallas we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism that mass infection would make us a slave race your aliens agent mulder your little green men first landed here millions of years ago those that didnt leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age in the form of an evolved pathogen waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet using us as hosts against this we have no defense nothing but a weak vaccine do you see why it was kept secret why even the best men men like your father could not let the truth be known aids the ebola virus on the evolutionary scale they are newborns this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs no for god sake youve got it all backwards a simple unstoppable lifeform what is a virus but a colonizing force that can not be defeated living in a cave underground until it mutates and attacks no though i have no way to prove otherwise the virus is extraterrestrial we know very little about it except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with it must be administered with ninety six hours i think of it as an agreement a word your father liked to use im quite prepared to tell you everything though there isnt much you havent guessed yes i have answers for you hes come and gone mr mulder no you need only take away what is most precious to him you cant kill mulder hes got too much light on him no one believes kurtzweil or his books hes a toiler a crank our vaccine may have no effect and if it doesnt by cooperating now were but beggars to our demise our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all in hope of what learning that its true that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms this isnt colonization its spontaneous repopulation all our work if its true then theyve been using us all along weve been laboring under a lie my god more concerns than that im sorry my grandson fell and broke his legwere gon na get caught i know were gon na get caught they were eyeballing my car thats a horrible ugly comment dead whore shes a person bullshit its not accesory i didnt do shit you call the cops you explain it was an accident dont touch her call 911 i need a drink excellent i didnt hear you what did you say what go home dont

their own convictions this is war given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not we have chosen life over death two wrongs dont make a right so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here not less now i am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing its not its not a good thing but it was given the circumstances the smart play we did

alright lets do it we have to get going well what the fuck are we supposed to do shes asian they dont have jews in asia so thats what were doing how do you figure weve already done this what sun rises

what about the blood the teeth doin any talkin how soon can we get something the blood type on the rocks matches suzies wheres lombardo if im wrong about those teeth its a promise stick with me on this gloria i need you what if im right gloria what if im right and hunters wrong what do you do if you see a bad thing coming will you do me one favor poor dumb suzie she never had a chance you dont think sam couldve put it there the swamp most likely lombardos a swamp rat knows the body will never be found there but hes made a mistake those are suzie tollers teeth just check out the car im gon na take you back to the office will you put out a call on suzies car for me its starting gloria this is how it begins i mean something bad gloria something bad you saw coning and you didnt do anything and then it happened i did that once i dont want to do it again were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didnt do what you could to stop it guess i kind of lost it there what you wouldnt go after some guy you thought raped your daughter cone on she bought the same story we did i net a guy in a bar you got it the rich got richer while the saps like lombardo went bellyup in the swamp i flat dont like the guy glory hes dirty and ill tell you something else you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan on a little item known as the salt creek land deal it was after the war van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land got investors like lombardo to put up money then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve on the sly of course but everyone knew it was him the freeway went to the coast right where van ryan wanted it her father didnt leave her squat the kids got money in trust from her grandfather but she cant touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck the job looks okay to us but look at it from his point of view the mans surrounded by wealth and privilege but for him its just a reminder of what should have been his they chumped us gloria right from the start unless youre setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday i thought of that then i said come on youre lombardo your reputation is getting trashed you want to stop the bleeding you dont want to sit in jail for three months unless think back before the suit was filed before the trial lombardo had an affair with sandra right so why not tell us about the affair i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place you saw the news today its a shithole but she was dirty what was i gon na do this is where she lives she wants to talk beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all i busted her once for possession she wound up doing about six months at camp nine you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay yeah well van ryan got his i dont imagine he gives a shit now youre telling me you believe the guy still doesnt explain why he couldnt catch up with her i mean how long does it take to put on a shirt its our job gloria that would make it about the time of her old mans suicide you dont think that could explain some erratic behavior ive got that two oclock in town the teeth were they she looked shaky but lucid i thought i would just go with her stand at the door i think i looked away a split second then bingo just like that she puts a knee into my groin there was this coffee table between us and the wall she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case thing had a glass door i could hear it breaking i didnt go down but she slowed me up just enough before i could get to her shed turned on me with this small caliber handgun i yelled at her to put it down she got off a shot i took it in the shoulder i i had no choice i returned fire two rounds i think in the chest i told her i was coming with her she nodded like she understood we stood up together bit scratched but i had her pinned she calmed down i was going to cuff her she said she thought she was going to be sick she asked to use the bathroom i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder i did her rights i fucked up i lost control of the situation the one thing they train you for god what did i do kellys next gloria you think this is just about money about us looking foolish question him youre gon na find a stone cold manipulative psychopath and those girls are going to wind up dead i dont believe im hearing this a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse they were acting they were all acting from the beginning and we bought it hook line and sinker and now theyre home free with six million of sandra van ryans money you heard kelly say sam that was lombardo on the phone and you saw the girls weve got three guy mowing his yard couple of kids playing hoops not that stuff about her running away him trying to find her thats bullshit or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for way i hear it he was pretty tight with the kids one of the guys i say something funny lombardo ever come out here you and suzie used to come out here together im not on your property am i right did sam sell you on the idea right up front of whacking suzie thats murder kelly ive been a cop for a while kelly its hard enough for one person to keep a secret let alone three and then theres the love angle i mean do you and sam really want that little pillhead around now that you have the money the thing about it is threesomes so rarely work out you all gon na go down to the caribbean together curiosity i guess suzie toller is dead you dont want kelly to be next then take my advice stay out of my way im placing your daughter under arrest where is she detective duquette ms van ryan let me in now youre saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo sam for godsake you i shouldve killed you myself should never have left it up to him thats right that was his name dont you see what this means you really think sam and kelly are gon na give you a third of the money you the pillhead with the rap sheet suzie suzie this is me ray youre talking to we both know you dont have shit never have had shit never will have shit is that what you think you have friends is that what they told you you kelly sam every triangle ive ever seen never lasts somebodys got to go well youre half right best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me yeah theyre bad for your health im tryin to look out for you you ought to watch it with that shit suzie you get busted again you go back in a twotine loser it doesnt look like it no so suzie you called us remember meet my partner gloria perez that how you planned it you take cut suzie get me to hang it on kelly then dump me in the ocean yeah or get me drowned i thought this was supposed to be a vacation why didnt you buy a nice big power boat you mean this thing did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle jesus man it couldnt have worked out better theyre convinced kelly whacked suzie i cant talk em out of it we should be celebrating this thing worked out just like you said only better hey what did you want me to do die the bitch shot me is what happened sit down lombardo with a thirtyfive inch bustline in a wet tshirt with no bra but you do admit to touching her to putting your arm around her isnt that against the rules but she ran away and she began to cry and you put an arm around her but you cant tell us what she wanted to talk about and she wanted to talk in cutoffs a wet tshirt the one you bought at school why dont you tell us one more time how kelly came to be with you alone in your househow you doing artie thats great ill just tell my creditors im not a rapist no

windows theres a strip mall not half a mile from my house theres phones there i cruised the place but i didnt see her i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didnt want to be found i dont know maybe i should have called but its not like kelly cant take care of herself i figured wed just take it up on monday in the office no again i think we covered this i told her i was going to
