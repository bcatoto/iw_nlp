started it youre gon na pay for that pebbles what dude thats my sister uh we call my sister the invisible girl the invisible girl sweet youre really cramping my style here is that a trick question cmon i cant be the only one who thinks this is cool wait you mean theres chance we could be fullon247fantastic what is that thing okay mom flame on flame off flame on flame off please tell me you go silent too keep the hot side hot and the cool side coolben ive been crunching the numbers on the machine i think if we can rework the power settings time for your lesson vic chem 101 what happens when you supercool hot metal ben ben i dont know if this thingll change us back or make us worse i need you to be patient for a little while longe were working as hard as we can ben this isnt permanent johnny we need to be careful until were normal again okay well skip that question ben im afraid ive got to ask okay ive uh got some questions from sue that she thought might be better coming from me can you you know go to the bathroom like normal if were going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes we had a tough year ben are you okay are you alright hes smart powerful successful what come on shes got a good thing with victor yeah you and debbie and perfect i should have done more run more tests i dont know i just keep going over and over the numbers three days i was worried about you how are you feeling ben this is serious turn around the shields on the station should protect us victors better at these things hes made a few changes i had it at four when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do im sure hes matured since then youthful high spirits external srbs orbital system engines its just like the shuttles you flew in we got what we wanted thats enough ben think about all the people we can help if this works ben the moneys not important we could save lives ben this is business just work hes financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century this wasnt our first stop in case you forgot nasa and victors not that bad hes just a little larger than life now johnny supernova a higher calling like getting girls and making money you need to control yourself and think before you thats what im trying to calculate and its not rubber its muscle tendon i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to theyre not costumes what no im trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms is there something about flames about flaming that you not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to earths atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it back it down johnny and figure out how to reverse them let me show you to your rooms we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes oh it is ben grimm is a genuine american hero whos been through a terrible orde youve been working out ben are you there the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna hes not responsive victors right johnny get to the command center close the shields i found a broken gasket from space sue i need some of that anger rage frustration the power i need more power to control the storm i can make it work why didnt you say something you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you speak his mind one who wasnt afraid to tell you what he wanted you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late you were i could get ben to tap into the baxters main power to generate enough voltage im not the only one in there i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there which is why im working twenty hours a day checking every variable he was going to take away all my data equipment no way to know without more tests experiments with the right energy we can stabilize the storm maybe tie into the city grid of course of course curing countless diseases not just ours if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity the plants from space their particles are still charged with the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm there were a lot of variables to consider i think it was a little more complicated than no i distinctly remember you walked out my door ergo i mean you broke up with me right what in the world would give me that idea okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or im saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger can you remember the exact emotions when you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better its not invisibility per se youre bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field thats what you projected on the bridge thats what were here to find out sue your clothes lose them we need to get past them lets not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap sue look at your hands uh sue i cant for science passion i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship thats good thats uh good feeling better material made from selfregulating unstable molecules ive been working on a formula for this as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission i uh think i remember the number well uh based on our history you can handle the biogenetics and ill focus on the molecular physics or uhm maybe i should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and youre youve i mean how have you bee but im not done with the machine what are you doing here victor if we could understand what happened to us i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort not much we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage hes had some kind of reaction to exposure from the cloud and hes not the only one ben did this not until ben is back inside come on ben come on bens still out there weve got minutes until it hits not hours victor that storms deadly the radiations lethal we need to abort sure hilarious you back this mission and ill sign over a fair percentage of any applications or not at all you remember in school we talked about working together thats what i was about to explainhe couldnt generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass yet another mistake for mr fantastic he also said wed avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out to help you ive run every test known to man and they all yield the same result the machine is ready where do you think with sue ben come in come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company im worried about you thats terrible news what what do you mean complete like the shields reed said would protect us how long and theyre changing into front page make sure you find ben bring him back here and keep it quiet i dont need this to hit the press thats why because i could have any other woman you know when they asked caesar why england he said because its not mine later first ive got some unfinished business a deal that needs closing and thats a good thing get me on the am shows larry king cover of the journal ive got to do something about this scar make sure they only shoot my right side reeds disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose hows the ipo leonard hows the feed history leonard history everything else is conversation hows the other matter its not just the money i could make money in my sleep showtime reeds always right good thing he doesnt always know what hes got if reeds right then this little trip will double our stock offering which is precisely the point analysis is over its time for action my men could have massproduced this by now what i should have done a long time ago applications and patents reed this all belongs to me i dont want to understand it this isnt one of your science projects i just want to fix it fast abort reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool didnt go as planned it was a catastrophe you ruined the lives of four people im starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you ben did this just a little banged up a couple scrapes why its too late for him and soon itll be too late for all of us reed were running out of time so reel him in but we came here to do a job so lets do it quickly get a grip reed we didnt come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch just close the shields got it so take a walk ben im going to borrow susan for a second funny how things turn out isnt it the numbers seventyfive and its applications and patents this isnt going to be a problem is it but dreams dont pay the bills do they same old reed the hopeless optimist still reaching for the stars with the world on your back oh i think you already have then why is reed dragging his feet maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass its ironic isnt it youre finally the perfect woman for him because youre his science project same old reed all analysis no action wasnt that the problem with you two susan what are you doing it is theres something we need to talk about something i need to ask you please no apologies ive arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos youll have roundthe clock care i told you im fine its you im worried about just find him whats going on raising the shields sue ive lived my life unafraid of taking big steps and this is the biggest step yet if it helps think of this as a promotion a merger of sorts four little words that can change our lives right of course the company but you see ive come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with well when youre looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past surprised i agreed to reeds proposal i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm for your sake i hope youre right im sorry if that sounds a little skeptical im just saying i know what its like to lose something you love to see it slip away and know its never coming back i know it cant be easy life hasnt changed that much for reed sue and johnny at least they can go out in public but for you people staring whispering behind your backwere lucky to be alive stop it anyone i have a cb in my truck we could get some help out here one keg of beast for the basement then trucks dry my truck come on were better off well then i guess we should just give up

big deal just something i dabble in the trucks for a quick get away deliveries whatever nothing huh what go for it its by the far wall a small wave band channel 9 is the emergency frequency but i dont see the point in the kitchen under the sink the boards are solid oak planks and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath nothing real or supernatural is busting through this least nothing the size of the beasts huh so your dead hubby shot me twice three of my customers have been eaten and there are angry creatures outside jesus christ on the cross someone make sense what well wheres the sonuvabitchlets wait it out dont shes not very nice is she whats wrong do we have anything else to defend ourselves with anythingwell what are we gon na do about it now dont get all worked up justin i expected some common sense on your part and clearly i was expecting too much beat just open the drawer should we be what trying to change him any way we can beat yes what about starks then dont im fine i didnt put you in alpine grove i dont understand how did you come to know their names the three of you werent regular patients you were criminals that ended up at alpine grove it was part of the treatment i intendedi didnt know what the effects would be of people like you people i was just trying to help they couldnt get worse so i thought with medication they might get becausebecause you came out and said something you couldnt have possibly have known you came back and repeated three names i know beat i knew that when you came out i dont know how you died the last time i put you in the jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer no i didnt i swear i didnt i probably helped push you to kill yourself but i didnt do it you died starks years ago in the hospital howhow are you here beat youre his son who are you you in here beat works like a drug means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didnt at least try to ive managed to every sunday of my life beat some of us are god fearing men starks ill say a prayer for you in church today starks maybe the gods can pick up where the medicine left off you killed him yes and whats that temporarily it is but when it comes down to it you just have to patient with them theyd rather have their vacation too so they just push dealing with our practices off to the new year hello william i understand youve been asking for me almost every hour i wouldve been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about sit down mr starks sit down mr starks maybe not beat but i do think youre in a tree woofing like a dog and im just trying to help you the only way i can think of i wasnt pausing to see if you did beat but incidentally you should because youre birds of a feather i had a patient a few years ago his name was ted casey youre just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition pointedly of course youre not relax actually thats exactly what our equipment is we were forced to use restrains if thats what youre referring to in where then how would you describe him beth merely rebellious hes recovering on the third floor its not my job to believe you you said you couldnt remember killing officer harrison correct im just looking at you does that make you uncomfortable well your conditions pretty seriousive been here for 11 years its my neighborhood course im sure hes as drugged up as the rest of usi guess he has to be to put up with all this shrugging what if we are therere crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself beat everyone does it dont they even becker that roller coaster car pops more pills than all of ward 3 geez hows that for a fucking thank you you could still always give becker an itch course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it but seems to me youre saying thats about to happen anyway beat just be careful not to walk yourself right into something cause lorensons got her claws in it now when she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me women its gon na be sticky oh no youre pretty young your bodyll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think beat how do you know mortalitys actually a great thing to be familiar with it means youre sane on some level i know you need one when its really cold i wasnt talking about anything or just plain stupid youd think by the twentieth time id have found an alternative method maybe a more effective one if you know what i mean i tried something like 30 times there is as starks rightly figures no suitable response to that i tried to kill my wife tv helps numb makes a crazy gesture any active mind sticking out a jittery hand rudy mackenzie thats kingsley old bastard hears us im sure he just doesnt want to bother answering so he makes us think he cant talk i know i tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue literally beat youre the cop killer rightno beat you put me on drugs and then you put me in the jacket im in it as we speak beat youre haunting yourself right now beat i guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does you didnt make history like you wanted to huh dr becker it turned out different didnt it you just told me the last time i was with you was when i was in the jacket im in it right now dr becker no we were patients so what you guinea pig sick people to find out medication what kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer how i didnt say i remembered killing him i just repeated some words to get myself back in there i didnt kill myself i died from a blow to the head howd it happen i have to know i know beat you killed me didnt you no im not his son im him beat what you look like youve seen a ghost you can come here and touch me old man im the real thing i think you know your eyes say you do becker how do you sleep at night and what does that mean you sure you know where to find one getting away with things like whatever i may or may not have gotten away with officer harrison my business they make it hard for you to get away with your business huh thats too bad long live the organization for the organized we are not birds of a feather i dont give a shit about your patient i didnt dream it i may have been asleep but it wasnt a dream becker sits down in a chair halfshrouded in the light dont give me that i know whats real goddamnit you strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer dont act like i dont know whats real beat im not the one thats crazy here that wasnt a fucking restraint uncertainly in that thingthe jacket i dont know better all i know is that you left me in there are you kidding me hes not psychotic beat you dont believe me do you depends on what youre seeing beat so they say off beckers steady gaze what he died because he bled to death from a blow to his head someone had to have given him it i didnt beat did you have anything to do with his death thats too bad my father used to talk about you did you know my father he didnt either you may have known my father william starks yes beat it has everything up till today is done everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs and i cant stay here in my condition i am going to die tonight its already been decided i need to get this letter to someone beat thank you this is really happening isnt it good you done with your small talk i am one of the few things i remember doing is eating so i guess i must be exercising it off in my dreams what about dr becker and mr gries what about dr thomas becker or dr loel lorenson there was also a dr gries i think his body was found on january 1 1993 but do you know if that was long after he had died im doing fine i fell down beat but im alive i think so beat you be good to yourself jackie good hows your mom nowhere beat i just think im gon na be sick you got ta stop thinking like that when we first met when you were 7 where was the house you lived in with your mother do you remember your address lorensons the only one that could let me out of there i need something to persuade her that i was there get me something to take to her whats happening to me why am i getting so much weaker where are we going if everything hadnt happened the way it has then i wouldnt be here right now sitting in a car with you touching your face no he didnt beat theyre at church and i bet thats where becker is theyve got lives to be grateful for of course he will beat what day of the week is it then why isnt there anyone around i dont know maybe thats because this whole thing is a dream how can you have a street with no cars on it therere no cars on this street theyre not youre sure me too i might not be able to of course it makes me mad it makes me more than mad just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him but whats it gon na do for me to find them now i cant fix everything in three days i know it was perfect beat erase my sanity and you erase anything ill ever say i dont know why maybe i dont know seems more likely becker does but at the very least she knows how i died i have no idea i dont believe a thing she just said how did they figure it out after i died i didnt kill officer harrison if they dont take me out before then as an afterthought whats the net i know yes do you really believe me what after i yeah ill leave but look at me look at my face jackie im not lying i met you and your mother i told you then that id lost my memory beat there was no one for miles around so i know you know theres no way i could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around its december 25th 1993 today howd he die i gave you my dog tags how beat what beat what im sorry for upsetting you beat but im not lying to you no i dont have anything to show you im here from a mental hospital jackie im william starks i can prove it beat i know it doesnt make sense it doesnt even make sense to me i think i can remember whats on them beat in case you get lost or cant remember who you are dog tags off her blank look theyve got your name and date of birth for identification yeah ill hitch a ride or something beat let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel hey can you reach the gas pedal beat whats your name your mom take anything before this happened you two ok good you know how to get there youll figure it out and youll do good by him i dont know when itll happen but soon i think youll shock the boy and itll wake him up you did in the future you figured it out because a part of you already knows this thats how it works beat im just telling you something you already know even if you havent realized it hes having absence pronounced absance seizures when he stares off into space like he does he has them so often that thats why he hasnt learned to speak properly listen to me thats all i ask no listen to methe kid eugene you still dont believe me do you can i get some paper and something to write with who are you kidding doc you or me whowho kills me i did howhow do you know no theyre not my delusions look just leave my business with becker to me some part of you suspects even if you dont know for sure that what im saying is true you told me about him i saw you and i think you thought i knew something about him so you told me because of the future i know whats going to happen im about to die unless i do something to stop it because i dont have time maybe i didnt see that much of it same as now i only saw it as part of my own life no not for people like me beat not in the places i come from it doesnt look all that different 2004 beat ive seen a time thats not this time and im only able to see it when im in the jacket come on tell me what you do know i dont know frustrated remember this has nothing to do with that you dont understand listen to me you dont the jacket is my only chance in this place you have no idea whats going on ill die either way beat we will exactly beat yeah it is why would we do that my dad wrote some things down before he died well do you think dr becker would have any idea but dr morgan said you were around when my father was beat i dont know howd he get it what case you thought my father was crazy why i never knew my father did you believe me i know no i dont want it to i could try tomake it stop why what would you do no the real events that have happened to me have been fucked up not my mind that conviction doesnt convince me of anything until i know that i did it im not going to accept that i did because i dont think im crazy and if i didnt want to come becker does are you sure mackenzie beat what if we are crazy is it true so what am i supposed to do why no beat i mean i found out while i was in it that my bodys gon na be found in four days the jacket gravely no i mean in four days im supposed to die cutting in mackenzie listen to me listen im going to die yeah you were what you said about them taking me out to the woods what were you talking about the other day yeah well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy dont you go to jail for that yeah guess so howd you know sure where are you going i doubt it beat i dont think prisons so bad you dont want to remember it no that when you stopped being a nurse im sorry how yeah beat how about you i guess not but as of now i never knew either they told me i joined the army when i was seventeen thats when my father died and before that it was apparently just me and him since i was born cause my mom split but hey who can forget those words the man just wants simple and good things for his woman that she be warm and happy how hard can that be to remember this is a great song you dont think thats crazy beat why i dont know but i think part of its beat whyd you stop have you always been a waitress you like it so youre a waitress right i meanfrom the uniform you were wearing thanks sure i only lit it because it was so cold in here im sorry if the best i could do with what was in your fridge beat yeah im fine no im ok ill manage nothing getting up thanks for

of the secret police that might explain all the hassle and the coverup well it seems theyve dropped any charge relating to the files you know there is one thing i cant figure out all along theyve been bugging me about those files and when i told them id burned all that stuff they went nuts they told the consul guy they were medical records now youre using that word well the trials in two weeks but

fourthirty dont worry if the old ladys there ill brick it back up ill rig up something dont worry do you think i could bash through with that little hammer well its definitely there weve just got to get to it just think though it would make a hell of a cafe that way we keep the auditorium clear no way its sealed if shes in there shes dead it must be fair old size suppose its empty id love to get in there i dont know this wall isnt like the rest though its not all that old either it must be on the other side of this no its welded uplets take a look from the inside i dont know but that used to be a window and i think that was a door just save me a little patch and ill do it later perfect but i cant use it right now ive got to get these locks done its a matter of priorities yes but it suddenly clicked this is going to be a crazy place and since the commies are used to seeking asylum we can use that in the marketing none its mine you said it earlier im nuts nothe asylum nope not even close ive thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though yeah that was honzas idea i had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear no why good i love swinging a shovel well dont get carried away wowwhat have you been doing rolling around in it yep except a name for this place tell them were working for the university nobut i think honza at the office has you keep shifting this crap and ill take care of the locks shouldnt take long take a break for lunch and ill catch you up later im making history chris nothings going to stop me there could be a knighthood for us in this once president havel hears ill drill the locks and replace the barrels that way it wont cost so much later mate right now ive got to do the locks on these doors so we dont have to climb through that bloody window every time not bad hey i think ill add sparkie to my resumegood shovel well we might as well start filling it in now as long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe so i can get to it were set use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space well neaten it up later somehow im going to have to bandaid that thing since we cant really replace it and then put a walkway over it sureas for the crap ive got an idea scout around and see if theres something check that other corridor if theres nothing nip out and buy a broom and shovel dont worry ill give you a hand as soon as i can too rightnow the other thing weve got to do is start clearing up the rubble can you make a start on that no he was talking about girls i think no but like my dad said theres only so many ways you can wire a plug yeah that could be job number two i think its a sewer great lets say nine oclock here tomorrow catch you later partner you got my word on it damn right it is its a chance to do something meaningful for a change to leave our mark on this town hell youll probably be gone in another six months and all youll have done is taught some kids the lines to a led zep song cmon dont run out on me now chris what if i were to cut you in as partner in this project together we could make it swing all it needs is a good clean out and the power on then were in business you were right jahn its a great space hey chris do you want to come and look okay its in here somewhere lets keep it quiet its big right jahn well its like i said theres a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city so theyre not private now jahn here is an drama student at the university he knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre they even began work on it until they ran out of money no ifs or buts its a cinch do you want to know what the icing is well providing were treated like czechs and we squat something thats not privately owned we should be in the clear at least doug until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs good news comrades its better than wed hoped lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and its a piece of cake these guys think the west is just mtv and hollywood movies weve got to show them theres more to it maybe but someones got to make a stand what we need is a space for real performance art a cultural exchange for radical expressionism right and not just the bar lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin building no its the whole idea behind it how did they get this place an alternative literary venue this place is getting expensive too used to be twelve what did the beer cost hmmsmells good cheers thats lubosh the greatest fiddle player in prague you must have seen him playing with johnny on the bridge come on lets grab a table just because theyve got a choice of four mcdonalds doesnt mean they can afford a cheeseburger it all

earns no just crap i want some picture frames yeah lets check out the lowlife youre outnumbered kat two to one got to go with the majority thats democracy well this place is too expensive so youve had it you guys having a go a me or what inspirations a fickle thing you dont realise you had it till its gone no you dont get it every cabby in town knows this joint so wheres the mystery the danger yeah but its not just that to the czech mind any movement whether political or literary should be underground if it isnt then its not radical and not worthy of a lookin yeah righti dont know something isnt right with this place its all too sterile and staged do you ever wonder why theres no czechs here wanker more like what does he know about writing what is it with that josh guy who does he think he is

theyll lose tomorrow i see it with stunning clarity the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since 1918 you expect me to miss that for an opening night we dont even like each other do we in and out of bed this is how weve managed to last three games to two but if you know their history you realize theres a tragedy in the making ive been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old the red sox they can send their heartless brilliant boycritic theres a much bigger thing going on than tonights opening look all i want is a haircut im not worried about this guy about what ive got bigger problems joanna personal problems can he get through it our peter i talked to her two days ago shes dying you know about adele i hear alans sick i see the outline of your

date opening night laurel tickets are all set i doublechecked this person and i are a thing of the total past i promise you dont call her mother all the time it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving what happened to mom your mother and i have something between us thats too strong to damage permanently believe me i know this thats right nineteen years and what about the days and minutes sharing small moments sharing memories raising a beautiful child were wedded in the deepest and strongest ways lillian isnt only my wife shes my best friend youre too young to be studying criminal behavior its making you obsessive dont be so steelyeyed its that course youre taking in criminology i just had breakfast with her she didnt say a word about this if lawyers for the mob are called controversial why are divorce lawyers called prominent and he hears it the same time i hear it what happened to family secrets dont talk like that how prominent what are you implying thats completely crazy why do you need a radio what do you want to talk about ill talk about anything whats this do you want to get some coffee i never see you anymore where are you all day i feel great i feel impeccably alive im elated eat something please i love you we did it in the office she thought her apartment was too impersonal it was an animal thing no real intimacy i am really deeply sorry im a man shes you know a woman alma wetzel i had an affair are you sure you want to hear this there may be things youd rather not know about laurel wants us to be honest and open lets be open with each other i went because you went you smoked because i smoked you smoked because i smoked we were falling in love remember i used to see certain movies only because you had seen them i wanted to see what you saw and youve been extremely patient the whole thing is my fault i took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding you understand me opening night lillian bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning ill have whatever shes having how prominent all right whats been going on we stranded five runners in the first two innings this will come back to haunt us twoall after six life is real this could be it a thousand things its stanley its the steamer fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night one more out all the failures all the fatalism i dont know if i can say that life is good theyre always winning until they lose i respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi but lets put a lid on the questions this place becomes famous tour buses blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall what do you want me to do i was in a hurry to do big things make big mistakes any mistakes were okay as long as it was big but im trying to see these things clearly and honestly thats the play theyre going to kill starting tonight theres a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart and thats us who we were and where we come from normal boys ambition i like coming back you know that i think the buildings okay at least for the time being i know pop ill go get you another one you have to wear it youre suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble wheres your elastic brace lets not start that again hey pop i know you dont like the commotion of opening night but i especially want you to see this play its new territory for me and for you too i have to know what you think youll need these tonight for the play i could have grown up happy a yankee fan a divorce lawyer its all connected pop its one life baseball is memory how do fathers and sons show their love they go to a ball game together thirtyfive years later they sit in the kitchen and remember remember 1949 last two games of the season against the yankees the sox lost on saturday then they lost on sunday first i cried for twentyfour hours then i had fist fights the rest of the week of course theyre gon na lose well watch them lose what good is heartbreak if we dont experience it firsthand i do know the answer to that why dont we watch the ball game later well go to mannions lillian says it once a week why doesnt he come live with us we must have been heroic its a constant shock to me how small this place is how did we do it five people in these little rooms across ninth avenue dodgies where youve been getting your hair cut for fifty years where uncle billy and uncle marty got their hair cut where jim rorty shot a man for cheating at poker im on my way to get a haircut where are your glasses go get them its me nicky right here at the door pop will you let me in im at the door this could be it its a test all right theyre bringing in stanley because life is good all the times i died when the red sox lost an important game they should have won all the awful things i said to my mother and father to tmy wife and daughter he used to love losers but the laws of physics changed this is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see matthew the red sox win a world series this is deeply intensely personal all the mistakes ive made all the envy fear and violence thats encased in this little envelope we call a person all washed away in the next few minutes and your grandmother knows why i dont know life is good i want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments i want to believe it looked extremely rocky for the boston nine that day winning is easy losing is complicated its a lifetimes work its a complicated subject i dont know toyota what does he do wife and daughter my fathers still alive he outlives me starting tonight because the mets just tied the score it was only a matter of time wasnt it its complicated its a whole life a person doesnt commit an act of violence out of nowhere there are strong forces at work thats my cousin angelo hey toyota he asked me a question what am i doing look were stuck here front and back its dinnertime for you game time for me lets park the cab and go to mannions what do you say matthew well drink beer and talk baseball now thats a complicated subject its the kids lucky day a grandmother god bless you how come you got the kid with you call me frankie and it looks like were going nowhere some little kid stole the hubcaps oh yeah everybody else does why not you and youre not saying that because of the gun in my hand what about my play i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first thats when i knew the red sox were my team pity and terror if youre such a devoted fan why were you at the play tonight instead of the game answer carefully this is important you could have gone to the theater last night there was no game last night i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game my wife is from boston lillian ziegler no theyre not your team theyre my team why do you care why does it matter ive had three straight washouts sidney postpone we have every right m not worried about this kid hat was this morning appreciate that sidney but our leading man cant remember his lines and his understudy cant carry the play aybe we ought to postpone the opening youre not making sense eleventh inning what else have to hurry back when the mets lose they just lose its a flat feeling but the red sox here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game defeats that keep you awake that pound in your head like the hammer of fate i hate the mets finally i get a waiter who doesnt know macbeth get the hell out of here i dont want you bringing our food send a real waiter why what do you mean this could be it and the father replies yes yes mine was cobalt blue what was your favorite color crayon growing up you have to see the words try to build a mental picture of the script imagine your lines high lighted with a felt tip pen yes peter yes yes sidney fabrikant our producer sidney remains optimistic im actually beginning to enjoy this yes what come on paisley yes i know you both enough how much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy so

different story for every woman who asks i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me yeah as an adult i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex

women wanted me there for support you can understand that a weekend you stand on your tiptoes its cute who are they you quitting its okay hell ive never paid for it but please dont feel like you have
