compensated thats trust mr christian trusted me implicitly wouldnt exactly have been possible for a man of his stature well whatever reasons mrs christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator i should certainly be a party to but since she feels differently i can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval you are a private investigator as mr christians attorney and one of the executors of his estate it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend yes i do have something to say i insisted on being here as soon as i heard mrs christian contacted youget together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head till then fuck you the only thing wrong is the cheap softcore crap youre peddling eddie where do you get this stuff i had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt and try to fucking return itlook thats awful generous and everything whats this still dont want to tell me what youre doing whats next i know if i had to pick itd be choke or devil

some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a out of the back of bondage magazines mostly but you can find it on the street if you look hell also do commissions for enough money youre learning his stuff comes out of new york bondage and fetish videos gothic hardcore definitely not for the squeamish dino velvet yeah hes like the john luc godard of sm flicks supposed to be a real weirdo so you have a wife and kid waiting for you in pennsylvania what are you doing mixed up in all this i see a ring on your finger you have any kids you cant sit

internet anyone with a computer and enough patience can find anything he wants its heaven for those degenerate chickenhawks theyre swapping pictures back and forth as fast as their modems can zap em but theres still some weird shit under the counter where i work sometimes no one knows where it comes from thats local underground where information spreads by word of mouth those are zombies hardcore junkies their hands are permanently pruned they go out in the sun they dont burn they blister other than that all i know about is the mail classified ads in the paper with hidden codes secret couriers credit card orders to dummy corporations interstate wire transfers revolving po boxes but if youre asking me who do you go to to get illegal shit who knows thats the whole point the seller stays as far away from the buyer as possible and vice versa and cops cant trace the deal theres ways to do it so nobody knows who anybody is i heard you asking that guy wasnt yanking you around theres no such thing theres two kinds of specialty product legal and illegal foot fetish shit films watersports bondage spanking fisting she males hemaphrodites its beyond hardcore but legal this is the kind of hardcore where one guys going to look at it and throw up another guy looks at it and falls in love now with some of the sm and bondage films they straddle the line how are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not step over that line youre into kiddie porn rape films but there arent many ive never seen one what you saw tonight were not

million dollars one was for two hundred thousand one dollar and thirteen cents another was for three hundred thousand six hundred fifty four dollars and seventy six cents the checks were for odd amounts my husband never dealt with money personally certainly not cash i know what im asking your compensation will be appropriate to the risk youll need cash to buy information and ill provide it i feel responsible mr welles you saw what he did to her youve found missing persons before any evidence you collect can be given to the police later anonymously ive thought about it and theres no other way if you cant find them if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for well i cant let that happen im telling you i wont if theres no chance that poor girls memory can be served then ill just have to spend my last days trying to forget her no for me to live with the ruin of my husbands name i need know that whoever did this will be punished if you can find them i will take their names to the police ill say my husband confessed on his death bed ill say i didnt have courage to come forward at first i told you i cant not yet will you watch it and see for yourself im telling you its not that no i didnt know what to think i cant tell you how horrible its been to know this belonged to my husband to know that he watched this this atrocity but i cant go to the police this is a movie showing a girl being murdered shes sitting on a bed and a man rapes her and he begins to cut her with a knife i only watched what i could its a film of a girl being murdered cash stock certificates and this there was nothing he could do my husband left everything to me i prevented anyone from seeing the contents i felt these were my husbands private things i didnt i didnt realize my husband was the only one with the combination to this safe i knew about it but as far as i was concerned it was none of my business not till now that is just curious do you carry a gun mr welles we were married fortyfive years hard even for me to imagine we had our troubles there were plenty of places for him to be other than here but he was always loyal to me and i to him i loved him deeply mostly thats where he started his empire building he was a good man notorious as an eccentric but that was something he cultivated he wanted to be legendary his passing has left me with something of a dilemma a terrible terrible dilemma as you know my husband passed away recently two weeks ago now you are highly recommended praised for your discretion your strict adherence to confidentiality ive spoken to friends of mine and my husbands in harrisburg in lancaster and hershey asking about you i must say you have friends in influential places hes a lawyer please sit here have a pleasant evening will you have tea mister welles apparently mr longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and i speak mister welles youre very promptwhy why are you doing this to me no no no no who are you who is this what what are you talking about i remember you just left hello what am i supposed to do forget her time heals all wounds right shes all i think about and ive learned to live with that but you want the truth the real truth if i had a choice if i had to choose between her being out there living a good life and being happy and me not knowing never finding out what happened to her or her being dead and me knowing id choose to know i think about it everyday but every time the phone rings every single time i still think its her yes my husband never laid a hand on her she would have told me she would have told me how how can you say that to me no you dont have any reason to think that i dont know i think so there wasnt one the police looked what you should be are you religious doesnt make much sense does it when everythings happy when lifes fine and you have every reason to believe theres a god you dont bother then something horrible happens thats when you start praying all the time thats when you start going to church okay people remember me from the news can you drive me back now no one knows what its like you cant even imagine how much it hurts you try going through what we did bob couldnt take it thats all christ theres times when it still seems like i cant either there wasnt anything like that the police and the fbi people asked but there wasnt anything happened like that never my husband his heart broke when mary left it got to be too much for him we were divorced by then things fell apart he was living with a friend yes i

his wife what happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81 which heads into philadelphia started up a conversation with this girl she looked homeless seemed about eighteen maybe they convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city nice kid mature didnt have much to say but they got a sense shes a runaway so all through dinner the doctors working on her trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone not surprisingly she ate her food excused herself thats the last they saw her the reason they came to me for help the reason im coming to you is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch they want to see if i can id this girl somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kids alive doing alright absolutely of course ill abide by whatever decision you make but id appreciate if youll hear me out what id like very simply is access to your archive and now i understand this isnt something you normally do for private

arranged no return address you dug this up all by yourself for a human life murder on film no statute of limitations who knows it sure could have id like you to overnight me a copy of those checks then put them in a safe deposit box im here youre joking okay i follow you so far im not positive this means anything okay nothing remotely like this i deal in divorce cases corporate investigations it wont work like that you dont have any other choice you you need to go to the police of course but im certain its nothing to worry about im sure it is its probably something your husband was given as a bad joke more than likely he never even watched it if you were to study it youd see the camera cutting away youd see the tricks they can play please believe me this is probably a stag film simulated rape hard to stomach and it might seem real but there are ways of making it look realistic fake blood and special effects mrs christian please will you sit down a moment i want you to listen carefully what youre talking about is a snuff film but from what i know snuff films are a kind of urban myth like red light district folklore theres no such thing i can assure you im afraid i dont do you want to tell me what you found you hired someone to open it ill bet the lawyer loved that i wear a gun when i can tell a client expects me to other than that theres never any reason he succeeded pittsburgh ill do whatever i can to help my condolences ive been privileged to provide services for people i admire hes odd thank you uh huh pleasure i try to be they murdered her mrs mathews im sorry it happened a month after she ran away shes been dead all this time they killed her and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her he raped her andandand he murdered herhe cut her up with knifes they brought her into the room one man he put a knife to her throat and he raped her someone some men they took your daughter and they drugged her and they took her to a motel room they did terrible things to her mrs mathews your daughter is dead shes dead she went to california to los angeles she wanted to start over she wanted to be an actress i have to tell you something it wont be easy for you to hear its about your daughter mary anne when i when i was there with you her diary in your attic in silverware if you read it youll know what im telling you is true mrs mathews its thomas do you remember i was there a few weeks ago asking about your daughter its been six years you were right i didnt find anything im going to run and get something to eat are you hungry youre probably right and i probably wont find anything i dont have a right to ask this and you can kick me out of your house if you want but this is my profession and theres a part of me that cant let it go police are just as human as you or i they could have missed something they probably didnt wouldnt you rather know will you let me look if the police focused their search in her room her belongings well thatd be only natural but they may have been looking in the wrong place it is possible and i know this isnt something you want to hear your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it but where she knew your husband would never find it she might have wanted to tell you something do you think the police did a good job its not really my place but its not easy for me to set aside the private detective part of me either see i know a little about missing persons when kids run they almost always leave a note its guilt they want to say goodbye ive got what i need for my report there is there is one thing that bothers me though no were all like that i i shouldnt take anymore of your time maybe we can finish tomorrow ill call tomorrow of course i had to ask i apologize i didnt mean to you have to forgive me but in these circumstances with your daughter were there any indications of any sort of abuse why do you think he did it september 4th 1993 about a year after mary disappeared if theres anything you feel uncomfortable talking about tell me but i have to ask your husband he committed suicide what was she running from she just seemed depressed so she didnt leave a note she never gave any indication where she might go before she left you probably expect me to be wearing a trench coat and a hat drinking whiskey chasing women and getting beaten up by guys with broken noses want to know what its really like its sitting in a car and staring at a hotel window for three days straight pissing in a plastic bottle pardon me because some guy thinks his wifes cheating on him glamorous huh and the guy who hired you he has a hairlip dandruff and crooked teeth and you could have told him the minute you laid eyes on him his wifes cheating and you dont blame her thats exactly what i am its very important you dont let this raise your expectations its not going to effect any ongoing efforts all im saying is please know im not here to create any false hope well im following up on your daughter mary height five four weight hundred ten pounds brown eyes blonde hair born april 24 1976 missing june 11th 1992 a runaway thats how

to give it to him myselfoh fuck up where just for him what did he bring him in for youre not being charged its up to you do you want to talk to them what any word back from the ers look look im not saying one way or the other just be careful and go by the protocol on this one well not armed if they had guns theyd have used them but dangerous oh yeah look under the body paraffin came up positive and bullet holes are usually a big clue look in the trash around their hands see if you can find me two bullet casings 45s if my eye serves me right dont disturb them mark them as they lay newman root through this shit if this was a sink find me some metal parts gim me a faucet or a drain cover or something be careful ill see what i can do how do i get in touch with you so youre telling me it was one guy with six guns aand he was a senior fucking citizen well we could try the bag over the head thing walk you right out the front know any other languages so how is it that you guys are fluent in russian they had some pretty interesting bandages know anything about that you guys are not under oath here i am assuming you knew these two guys from before huh friends gentlemen they were friends the shooter knew these guys huh and its the same story over here why the crossover theories no this guy is big time these two are streetwalking scum nah too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the copley plaza besides if youre a hitter youre either working for the russians or the italians theres no riding the fence our little theory from last night just got blown to shit something new is going on here of course they were how many can she id them that depends you either do your job or get ethical fanfuckintastic and number three dolly yeah well im an expert in name ology fucking figures look are you guys seeing the pattern here we got big questions at both of these crime scenes with no answers why did they kill the guys in the other two booths why did he do the bartender it would seem unnecessary even stupid god i hate cold crime scenes im fucking leaving now and do me a favor tell me when the next guy dies cause these guys are not done yet duffy this look like a fucking post office to you this guy came in here with intent maybe he didnt know exactly what he was gon na do but he had a pretty good idea the bartender wasnt a fucking accident these two fucking scenes are related too many coincidences same day five hours apart dead mobsters on both scenes now why did he kill the bartender why was i not informed of this what those doors were down which means this they looked down in through the peep hole saw these guys and opened the doors from the inside pop pop pop right through the glass why allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry as im sure youve never been in one of these places before a man goes into the booth puts the money in the slot the dancer gets it on the other side she hits the button door goes up now there is only glass between you and its little fireman time and is there an american shit is there a man seated among us that hasnt thought about it many times lets just put them all on an island give them guns and let them kill each other this is our wet dream come true you can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law then bury it from here on out now what is this going to look like to those who do not know what i just told you possible but unlikely the angles are too extreme a guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gon na shoot straight ahead he wouldnt cock out his elbows makes no sense besides you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds no way had to be at least two now stay with me boys what did they do to make two such identical wounds did one guy put him on his knees pop a cap in sit him back up and shoot him again the same way no two men of similar height dropped this guy down each put some iron to his head and boom thats all she fuckin wrote excellent number two greenly the two bullets went in here through the top of the skull crisscrossed and exited through the eyeballs this one clue tells us three distinct facts number one duffy the greeks the italians thats a possibility yknow you boston cops are perking up thats two sound theories in one day neither of which deal with abnormally sized men another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent and the pennies well freud was right so you think they came for the fag man huh and what do you base this upon the what man so duffy got any theories to go with that tie really want to know why dont you let me do the thinking huh genius oh thats just beautiful all the scumbags in the quiet city of boston start dropping dead and you think its unrelated greenly the day i want the boston police doing my thinking for me i will have a fucking tag on my toe now get me a squad car and get me over there i want the crime scene photos and any witness statements now who were the victims no way they could have seen it after talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth after she watches them whack him she passes out why the two extra victims it tells us that he was the last to die all these men were carrying they came in dropped all in seconds and then took their time with fag man didnt they duffy they sure as fuck did while greenlys getting coffee anybody else want anything how many bodies greenly respect is earned greenly never given guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table hes struck again hasnt he greenly sweetnlow twist of lemon brilliant so now we got a huge guy theory and serial crusher theory top fucking notch whats your name thank you father thank you whatever goodbye amen yes yes i was thinking that too no i was feeling it all i needed was to hear you say it amen ill help them no they would never do that yes i believe these young men are right i want to stand for what i believe in father youre right i guess not has he now yes yes but in this day and age i believe what they do is necessary i feel it is correct its ethics i put evil men behind bars but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these cocksuckers to slip through ive found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist as if they have gods permission but what they do is wrong and i should arrest them technically why have i come to a church i never have before i guess i just felt i should hello you therewhats she so emotional about i think mary agnes could kill someone homer you know i would never kill anyoneyou know i wouldnt sometimes i want to meet them so i can

dont you heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once oh no jason nesmith couldnt possibly go ahead must be some sort of mining facility this much about this much dont be insane stop full stop you dont hold a thruster down its for quick boosts weve got to stop like throwing gasoline on a fire just god what an ass to camera center no matter whose shot youre blocking damn you damn you i wont and nothing you say friend you stole all my best lines you cut me out of episode two entirely as a matter of fact i do look at their eyes theyre obviously nocturnal come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31 this is ludicrous why are you listening to this man must i remind you that he is wearing a costume not a uniform hes no more equipped to lead us than this fellow no offense and note the sucked in gut you think you could do better laredo shut up whats happened could you possibly try not to hit every single one he wants to think jason what have you gotten us into no i cant go out there i wont say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time i wont i cant i played richard iii hes a twit by grabthars hammer this is true yes you did back there you said the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals you said the commander he knocked me out the sonofabitch where is he it doesnt make sense surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures nobody was watching could they be the miners to see if theres a pub go into the cloud weve have to stop may i get the check we heard it the first time oh my god its real yes poor jason as we speak hes probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangerson while here i sit eating christmas cheese in spring a boy comes to the door i still havent got this bloody thing off oh good theres nothing to eat oh cant i watch me dear god how did i come to this hes a miserable twitwed better get everybody online and kyle stop downloading porn your frame rate is unacceptable youve got the utility systems walkthrough right no time for pleasantries kyle

go wait two seconds then go commander you and lt madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom yes commander all right youre almost there just go through the chompers and over the pit my cousins boyfriends sister went out with the screenwriter his favorite movie is the omegaman hes seen it 13 times no i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer but a matter rearranger converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past its been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years many believe that is a matter collapser a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds well thats the big question isnt it yes commander okay thats where you want to be okay so do you see a door marked core unit should be down at the far end to your left commander do you have a camera id die to see this in person all they showed on tv was a machine here and a wall here i dont know why they didnt show the whole thing now make a right youll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility the bowels of the ship okay now left at the next turn past the oxygen units make a right there then go through the antimatter vent okay you can go on in im going to get kyle he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive i knew it i knew it but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase okay i

you said i know you meant it constructively but brandon oh oh i see oh yes yes but we were wondering commander as i was saying in the quasar dilemma you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix so we were wondering where the error lies commander please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having in the quasar dilemma the sentient had taken control of the ships guidance systems howeverim just a glorified extra fred im a dead man anyway if im going to die id rather go out a hero than a coward listen ill go in create a distraction have this may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape of course well just zap him up with the digital conveyor i dont like this i dont like this at all

more supportive you could have held on to me do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard can it be repaired are they behind us maybe we can lose them in that cloud listen sarris you cant blame me for trying i made the cut the line gesture you nodded okay you just keep pushing those buttons those there send everything at him okay were going to fire everything weve got at him all right all

exploration administration there is no snip well sort of you what what are you talking about mathesar what is that mathesar i need you to prepare pods for my crew former commander then how did he find

we dont know what it does either they designed the ship from watching you so take her out lieutenant i think were going to exit the space port twenty third quadrant of gamma sector i can show you on a map thats right just keep shaking it out here have some gum it helps and determination i didnt say that i said wouldnt it be great if we could always work together thats what i saidthe ship is a model as big as this a very clever deception indeed he oant oontaln his lauchter a belletommy set a course for home lommander butwhy but inside i have seen but there it is we have become aware of these concepts only recently in our dealings with sarris often sarris will say one thing and do another promise us mercy and deliver destruction it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris deception lies we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations the fault must lie with us with the ship a thousand apologies we have failed you its the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185 commander im sorry you deserve to be shown our former commander was not strong no thank god he has not to our brave guests few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes we are blessed to count ourselves among them maintenance facility weapons storage how can we thank you commander you you have saved our people an interstellar vox he has a very powerful ship perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of but what if sarris survives theramin but commander the negotiation you you you fired on him you you mean earth commander where are you going as you wish commander welcome to the protector ii would you like to don your uniform sir i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol but please i beg you to hear our plea we are thermians from the klatu nebula our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by rothhar sarris of fatukrey sarris

a limousine i certainly but commander i must speak to you it is a matter of supreme importance we are thermians from the klatu nebula and we require your help i beseech you to come with us back to our ship a great many lives hang in the balanceyoull forgive my impertinence sir but even though we had never before met always considered you as a father to me it has been my greatest honor to serve with

everything no you fucked you dont invert stuff big tobacco tried to smear wigand you bought it the wall street journal here not exactly a bastion of anticapitalist sentiment refutes big tobaccos smear

state of mississippi the cat totally out of the bag youre still standing here debating don what the hell else do you need no i should have i told them i disagreed with you mike and kluster that this

what i hear oh no of course theyre not influenced by money they work for free and you are a volunteer executive producer its not a rumor its a sale if tisch can unload cbs for 81 a share to westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibilliondollar lawsuit from brown williamson that could screw up the sale could it not since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on 60 minutes tortious interference sounds like a disease caught by a radio yeah they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of kools to the world sealed doesnt hurt scruggs litigation and since were the only ones with the story i believe were sitting on an exclusive im not implying im quoting more vested interests persons who will profit from this merger ms helen caperelli general counsel of cbs news 39 million mr eric kluster president of cbs news 14 million before you go no im not im not touching my film so what happened to ms

mexico city branch you want it for the evening news debbie is cbs corporate telling cbs news do not go to air with this story is this alice in wonderland come again well as a standard ill hang with is

executive has reason to bet on being sued for major cigarette manufacturers and do you wish you hadnt come forward you wish you hadnt blown the whistle and on march 24 thomas sandefur ceo of brown williamson had you fired and the reason he gave you in other words you were charging sandefur and brown williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously and you sent the document forward to sandefur youre saying that brown williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix not by artificially adding nicotine but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia a delivery device for nicotine put it in your mouth light it up and youre gon na get your fix and thats what cigarettes are for all of us did there was this whole line of people whole line of ceos up there all swearing you heard mr sandefur say before congress that he believed nicotine was not addictivei cant say that he doesnt seem to be listening what youre breaking up i cant

time where are you anyway you fought for me you manipulated me into where i am now staring at the brown williamson building its all dark except the 10th floor thats the legal department thats where they fuck with my life up to you jeffrey thats the power you have jeffrey vital insider information the american public need to know lowell bergman the hot show who never met a source he couldnt turn around you greased the rails you manipulated me into this ive got to teach class ive got to go ive got to teach class i told the truth i told the truth what does this have to do with my testimony i told the truth its valid and true and provable what does this have to do with my testimony a can opener a 3995 can opener i canceled payment it was junk you ever bounce a check lowell you ever look at another womans tits you ever cheat a little on your taxes whose life if you look at it under a microscope doesnt have any flaws abc what kind of shit is this i was not on the team i sparred with the olympic team okay what she did not sue me we had a dispute over money i settled it she dropped the complaint any other questions i was young i was young confused we didnt handle it the right way i told the truth what do you want to do lowell look up my ass too i do not think that you know for me what it is to walk in my shoes for my kids to have seen it for them to know why ive put them through what i did the public airing of that the testament to why i did what i did youre telling me is not going to see the light of day no what part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly at least within no i mean since whenever whats changed i dont know what to do yeah great did you have a good day im going to be a witness for them in their litigation so im going to fly to pascagoula to give a deposition i called richard scruggs in mississippi lowell i cant afford to talk about it to think about it i had a plan to ease her into it but i really i didnt know how to do that ill call them lowell they get to go home at night what does it cost these people to do this to us nothing my girls are crying so fuck them i want to tape im done thinking about it they do this with impunity theyre terrorizing us death threats to my family my kids i have to put my familys welfare on the line here my friend and what are you puttin up youre puttin up words i dont think you really understand maybe thats just what youve been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job having status and maybe for the audience its just voyeurism something to do on a sunday night and maybe it wont change a fucking thing and people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry used up broke alone you believe that because you get information out to people something happens you believe that no im just a commodity to you arent i i could be anything right anything worth putting on between commercials i drink a couple of occasions more than i should have i was cited for shoplifting once but it was a mistake i pushed liane one time we were both stressed out because of the pressure she went to her mothers i got fired because when i get angry i have difficulty censoring myself and i dont like to be pushed around why my father was a mechanical engineer most ingenious man i ever knew is that why you became a journalist then you get to ask all the questions next to your father the internet said you did graduate work in wisconsin then went to uc la jolla with professor marcus tempura yeah look thanks for talking im sorry i woke you up howd you know that lowell okay no you said you were going to call me tomorrow so what about good you have kids the new place new ive always thought of myself as a man of science thats whats wrong with it i cant talk about it the work i was supposed to do might have had some positive effect i dont know it could have been beneficial mostly i got paid a lot i took the money my wife was happy my kids had good medical good schools got a great house i mean what the hell is wrong with that it was on cspan yeah the seven ceos of big tobacco they got up in front of congress that time it was on television johnson johnson union carbide in japan i was general manager and director of new products i speak japanese i was a director of corporate development at pfizer all healthrelated what else outside the zone like what they should be and im unemployed so i have to protect my medical coverage so i left them a message this morning their expanded confidentiality agreement i will sign it you came all the way down here to tell me that it happened after i talked to you i do not like coincidences how did brown williamson know i spoke to you so you didnt mention my name you havent talked to anybody about me this is my house in front of my wife my kids what business do we have what do good i want to talk to you jump in quick cmon fuck you too protect your sources you screwed me you sold me out should i just take the documents now how much would i get paid did work doesnt cbs have confidentiality agreements mr bergman this issue is a drop in the bucket i can talk to you about whats in here but i cant talk to you about anything else but thats as far as i go how did a radical journalist from ramparts magazine end up at cbs i know what i have to know like what your sign look i really dont have that much time black black whos that our favorite hotel honey i checked into room 930 odd choice huh and so i moved out i see the girls a couple of days a week liane has filed for divorce there is there is no family then hold it off the air until you got that but i want to go to new york and i want to go on the record right now someone put a bullet in my mailbox well no look i mean there was a footprint forget it its probably not important at all you know i got a job now im teaching high school japanese and chemistry so what were you calling about i dont know what the fuck i really think are they doing it is some crank doing it are they doing it to make me feel paranoid are they doing it for real and dont give a shit what i think i dont know i dont fucking know i dont want to be paranoid i mean maybe its a game some kind of mind game hold on a minute lowell somebody may be following me i dont know they came on the property shes okay for example james burke the ceo of johnson johnson when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles he didnt argue with the fda he didnt even wait for the fda to tell him he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america instantly and then he developed the safety cap because look as a ceo sure hes got ta be a great businessman right but hes also a man of science hes not going to allow his company to put on the shelf a product that might hurt people not like the seven dwarfs there are times i wish i hadnt done it but there are times that i feel compelled to do it ive if you asked me if i would do it again or if its do i think its worth it yeah i think its worth it i would bet on it yeah there are times i wish i hadnt done it there are times i feel compelled to do it if you asked me would i do it again do i think its worth it yeah i think its worth it poor communication skills most certainly i sent the document forward to sandefur i was told that we would continue to work on a substitute we werent going to remove it as it would impact sales and that that was his decision the straw that broke the camels back for me and really put me in trouble with sandefur was a compound called coumarin when i came on board at bw they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste and had been unsuccessful i wanted it out immediately i was told that it would affect sales so i should mind my own business i constructed a memo to mr sandefur indicating i could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew we had documentation was similar to coumadin a lungspecific carcinogen the process is known as impact boosting while not spiking nicotine they clearly manipulate it theres extensive use of this technology know as ammonia chemistry it allows for the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed in the lung and therefore affect the brain and central nervous system youre gon na get your fix a delivery device for nicotine part of the reason im here is i felt that their representation clearly misstated at least within brown williamsons representation clearly misstated what is common language within the company we are in the nicotine delivery business i believe mr sandefur perjured himself because i watched those testimonies very carefully how does one go to jail what does my family do go on welfare if my wife has to work whos going to look after the kids put food on the table my children need me if im not teaching theres no medical no medical even on co pay thats like tuition jail when should we do this mr scruggs jeff wigand lowell bergman said i should give you a call okay i dont believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements i was paid well for my work the health and welfare benefits are good the severance package is fair i have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which i said i wouldnt research you declare as a badge of honor you dont even know what makes water boil you threatening my family now too is that a threat chapter and verse id rather play than talk about it what did you want to see me about i dont like being back here sevenme too doc and i cant tell you what that package meant to me uh sorry im going to have to i really appreciate what youre trying to uh i cant thank you enough for whoa whoa what are you doing i want to know whats in here and the experiment is in here which i dont necessarily agree i find it degrading maximum gynecology and minimum turnon what exactly is it supposed to do should i open it now what is it you are so mean i was never satisfied we got divorced i had to get rid of her she couldnt satisfy me go to hell i never said that no i enjoy it does that make me some kind of pervert just because a man has a rich imaginative life you find it distasteful dont you why im paying for this what cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixens smile and i knew or maybe it wasnt an accident at all now hold on i didnt say i didnt want to come well i dont know i only been seeing you why not i have eighteen more minutesyoure the doctor what do you think shes gone weird is whats wrong with her out of control probably from living out here in mayberry no i mean about althea about her behavior do you think you can fix her up well im addicted to winning i say when youre in the red zone you got ta score so what do you think weve done very well you know anything about addiction doc well in 85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture weve got twentythree people working there now althea hasnt told you fill in the blank i dont mind the office the point is you only go round once like the zens say be here now i am and im not ashamed of it nobody ever said on their death bed i treated myself too well are you a man who likes to treat himself right i think youll like this know much about cuban cigars sorry im late traffic was a motherfucker have another drink ill be back in five you must be dr mumford of mumford jeremy brockettyou can go out there if you like take your time doubtful what did he say you must have been concerned what happened one hundred books uhhuh what are they i understand i just want to know what the argument was about really you think so hmm good kids how did they threaten you im not sure but i think theyre worried about you me more than most a friend no its sort of spur of the moment hello mr cook i was wondering if sofie was around generally that doesnt work out so well it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change sure why dont you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon whys that no a little theres a lot of debate about it syndrome chronic fatigue syndrome whats that uhhuh mr cook not any more no not really im fine dr sheeler is leaving mumford im sorry to hear that whats that i see what kind of doubts how do you mean my approach dorothy fowler fantastic woman she passed last year in a train wreck damned amtrak my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo are we right now of course ive heard great things about you dr delbanco its nice to see you again i feel like were making real progress here my pleasure theres absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you im embarrassed to have my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you maybe you could get

expect me at 530 tomorrow morning you like it in the capitol for boys nation five days why brady pecks fourteen years old lives next door is that when you split up its pretty obvious to a trained professional disgusting oh theres something wrong with you all right especially after hearing that dream of yours about the rotorooter yes it doesnt matter go on youre doing great sometimes yeah pulling in two different directions at once it makes tiny little tears in our fabric there ive given myself a real whopper all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time like ill think taking these walks is going to help sofie get better but then ill also think mumford you just enjoy taking these walks and youre kidding yourself about the benefits i can give myself a headache instantly so the headaches may not even be a part of this did you get headaches before this but you get more now or more severe life yeah most people have that its confusing here painful lymph glands forget fulness irritability depression sore throat be specific sorry im done really what would it take ive offended you okay then are you positive your mothers a bitch just kidding negative thinking makes everything more difficult if youre going to have enough strength to do this we have to talk only about positive things all right please forgive me somethings bothering her is she against you getting help maybe but youre the one whose ass is dragging people usually have to get to know me before they hate me well turn back anytime you want maybe youll catch it no one ever thought so you must bring it out well work it out well take it slow youll never feel you cant handle it ill come to you well try a little walking we we would try several things but i need to see you a lot i dont know whats real and what isnt thats never been my strong suit but if youre tired all the time and youve had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didnt want to thats worth trying to fix maybe i can help you do that hmm as in thats interesting sometimes with enough clues its possible to figure these things out hmm back when this started was there anything unusual happening in your life a change of job of living situation a loss of some kind no what when did you start to feel this way what can you tell me about this feel free to lie down most people do he agreed really no again what did he want you to do whatd he say do you think thats what he wants uhhuh true should we stop them was it something that happened at school what happened today if you dont want to have a session today its okay what do you want me to see thats not quite what i said you been spying on me in the supermarket nessa where was this its my bit for the community its called pro bono its a big part of the show why do you think you tell me nessa weekly or monthly what do you mean in no time yep what yes yes it does skip you know that its improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients wow lily skip thats great you and lily whatd i do really there are a lot of lonely people in the world somebodys gon na figure this out someday skip youre a visionary that can be a burden skip ive got a problem and i need some advice youre completely reliable im honored see you thursday regular time i understand what its like to want to leave a problem behind thats all most people are looking to do mainly i listen english lit no no training everything flows from that and what doesnt can be easily purchased oh you got it backwards i already had the name when i started looking for somewhere to settle when i saw this town on a map i thought maybe it was a sign see what about it all new people start with that you know how easy it is a kid can manage it if he wants a fake id you can do practically the whole deal at your local kinkos the only variable is how much pride you take in the product whod you go with thats not good thatd be lily harder than i thought took me three tries but i was highly motivated figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along after two bombouts i found a place in the desert things got a lot worse but look at me now get to know your therapist of course him being insane didnt make it all right that i fell in love with his wife didnt need one we didnt even need a warrant for most of the shit we did man the irs we could go in your bank account your credit cards hell we used to go into doctors files and get all the juicy details nobody wants to argue with the irs it wasnt the best situation what it felt like was a series of separate unconnected lives hillbilly kid wrecked college boy garbage man civil service guy et cetera et cetera every time id leave a life it felt good whatever problems i was having were suddenly gone i had no friends and i didnt talk to my family the only constant stabilizing force in my life was drugs everybody has a story skip but there was one job that looked like it might be fun investigator i can tell you anything else doesnt matter you can call me doc just you oh its okay its just not something to be ashamed of maybe you dont want people knowing and believe me its safe with me but on the scale of dirty little secrets id give it say a two skip thats not much of a secret definitely sounds like kind of a good idea and thats your secret you meant like a trade secret hows it coming a doll slash what jerking off okay lets say that for now you are panda monarch of modems skip knowing what you do about me youre concerned that maybe i cant be trusted with a secret its just a thought sometimes its best to keep a few things just for ourselves yep thats all right whats on your mind hey skip problem is his fantasy lifes a lot better than his real one nothing can live up to it his wife got sick of it and left him took his kids with her pretty good too lots of detail nothing hard core oldfashioned ones from back when people cared about atmosphere and character yeah guys got some serious sex fantasies this what kind of person do you have to be to do this amazing well theres lily lives downstairs from me shes got a great dog named for danny ainge shes probably ten years older than you lily and i talk a bit you know lily runs the coffee shop hell yes i like it whats better than this most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like so would you say were out here let me think how to put this is your problem really that youre lonely skip youre the head of the whole deal here are they busier than you skip you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with im impressed i couldnt make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes dont tell me cause im not going to tell you what ive got i understand is that the question have you thought about getting a wife can i ask you a personal question nah scotch no kidding panda whered that come from how are you i dont have one really most of the time im faking it see i think theres not much that can be done about most problems theyre too complicated too deeprooted by the time i hear about them the most i can do usually is look and listen real closely try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybodys got if i can get a sense of that well then maybe just maybe i can help them out a little i dont even know why hanggliding is considered a legitimate sport wallace franklin from greensburg oh yeah very tough but i guess thats good to keep out the quacks lots of institutions my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible prisons clinics halfway houses for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall had a little spot next to the yogurt place its possible i dont know about that why dont i call you when ive got my calendar in front of me forgive me please what a gracious thought we must do thatyeah salad nicoise i love salad nicoise what are

same really our songs our dreams our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever and smell a little funny were not bulletproof and we cant fly but were superheroes and that means doing whats

just leave me alone but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you until you just cant stand it anymore so you finally open up you pop like a blister and it all comes spewing out all your emotions your feelings your fears all of it and then they dump you nah why not so why dont you just tell her why do they always fill stuff these things so full you cant pull em out without ripping em we need a

taco down by the bus station but theres only three of us and hes got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal agents maybe shes right im soaked oh great the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced twenty years ago they were casanovas personal bodyguard but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork wait look but we dont know for sure its the same guy or flowers maybe you

suspicious i know it but look at him and look at us theres a vague similarity he doesnt miss a trick does he yes obiewan firepower costs money the eradicators so youre only invisible when absolutely

lined up like this like a little maze were all lab rats running through their maze pulling lever a or lever b each designed to create some kind of biochemical dependency all the while theyre everywhere watching us twoway mirrors surveillance cameras nodding to each other making little notes i cant help it suze its this place you know how i get in these stores they freak me out all these tiny boxes little cans filled with eight syllable god knows what all im saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research youre interested in have money because thats what theyre interested in money you think the chemists that invented agent orange twenty years ago were in school saying boy i really got some good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant you think oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war well see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making agent orange yeah well see thats what i thought sure can i ask you one more thing you havent published anything in a while how come yeah do you ever wonder what happened to us susie right you predicted it ive read theyre using it to repair cancer cells i remember you said nanotechnology was going to change the world ive been thinking about you a lot all these years locked up in my cell id tear through every issue of the midwest science journal looking for your latest findings watching as you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single celled organisms to that holiest of holies the fruit fly exciting stuff i got to tell you it really kept me going a cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men the big house oh yeah see susie a man doesnt do the hard time and just pick up where he left off oh no the big house does things to a man oh no not by a long shot i may look like the old daniel obrien but on the inside nothing is the same somebody has to you know this and that been out for six months now what no kiss not

one of his guinea pigs gets loose what im not going anywhere you i remember youso where does that leave us mr welles what kind of sad future are we two making a future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies a future where no price is too high for fame and power when we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard intimately for every sin you have placed on my head i could give you a hundred others i have been swimming in blood my entire life but i retain a belief perhaps you will think it old fashioned undoubtedly you will but i believe that private lives should not be public property i wonder do you have any idea what you have done in hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed well i wish you luck it is a treacherous business i see and you are in california for what reason the actor who are you sir see what you can do about this citizen kane picture wont you why is that louis oh why is that and maybe we could get mr warner and mr goldwyn and mr cohn and mr selznick to play as well apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself entirely too much like myself do you follow so far mm not a very good picture i am told quite and this is why i came to visit have you heard about this citizen kane picture hope you dont mind my popping in louis there is nothing to understand but this i am a man who could have been great but was not castle still fighting old battles he will never win with pulitzer and roosevelt and hollywood no you dont you want to condemn me like everyone else you want to point to the

of money to be my eyes and ears in hollywood do i not if you can not provide this simple service you are of no use to me why did we not know about this sooner miss parsons i have one additional

everyones happy you make some money and new yorks happy and you have a track record and then well move on to kane now dont have a fit but i want you to think again about doing war of the worlds listen get off your horse with me you know ive stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like while the stockholders in new york were ready to cut and run and everyone else in hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room but your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand this ones gon na come in at 750 thousand what do we do about that now look orson lets not get ahead of ourselves the budget projections on this citizen kane theres your title citizen kanethat poor woman carole you wound me as if i could hope to pacify you with evasions of oh but havent you heard im the boy wonder

fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip in your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock i learned at the knee of the master do you ill remember that so ive been told to make pictures and director my name is orson welles a toast then jedediah to love on my own terms those are the only terms anybody ever knows his own youre not going to get another chance boy look right at

got drunk to talk to me about miss alexander dont bother im not interested ive set back the sacred cause of reform is that it all right if thats the way they want it the people have made their choice its obvious the people prefer jim gettys to me i am not doing hearst thats right a symphony of those vaunted and valued tellersoftruth those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties good god no the character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons were using what we are going to do is shoot life in all its joyous complexity tome its a question of truth and illusion dont you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures you know all this nightmare we went through with hearst the whole thing and in the end probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway what have i done george mank you gon na watch you stupid little man how could you have let this happen i gave you my soul and now youre going to sell it is that from one of the gospels you wrote the damn thing mank arent you going to fight for it its too late the movies made what are they going to kill me is that what theyre going to do what does this have to do with christ so theyre jews hedy lamarr well at least shes off kane today no but i can imagine what am i today a puny upstart or a spoiled dilettante no she wouldnt know how to spell that mank sit down you missed the opening of the new picture but ill go back he was a drunk and he was my father and i was ashamed of him did i ever tell you about my father im sorry i want you back i just cant see it anymore and im looking at them and theyre all looking at me and i dont know who should pour the tea jesus christ to my invaluable comrade drink up but its not a great syllable kane one strong syllable kane i no american is a blessed title directly sent from gods soul to your mind we shall never change that i mean the name of the publisher charles foster craig doesnt have the knivesout poetry i need i was thinking about kane you like that short enough but this is a grand start and i think we need to change the name good good words fail you at last its terrific now ill have to do some shaping of course and some of the scenes arent exactly exactly it is 350 pages of absolute inspiration its 350 pages long the people when they pay him homage he adores them but when they have the audacity to question him to doubt him to embarrass him then he despises them hearst looks down at the world at his feet everything has always been beneath him he loves in his own way on his conditions because those are the only conditions he has ever known all men love but men like hearst they dont bother with convention because why her the key the key the clue what does this man recall on his death bed okay mank youre dying whats the last image that comes to you right now how so who is he we have to know him then let him what have we got to lose you and i not unless i tell you it is ill hire you right now it doesnt have to be i am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again listen to me because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself amusing his keepers because he is a sycophant because he has been thrown out of every studio in hollywood and no one will hire him because hes a drunk where did he go he hasnt had a screen credit in four years i remember a man who wrote i he was a brilliant writer who dazzled me time and time again with his wit and insight how does it feel mank going up to the palace and making all the lords and ladies laugh as you tell your little stories and beg for crumbs at the table how does it feel being the ugly little monkey they keep to amuse themselves i expected more from you so speaks the court jester were doing hearst now remember hes a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he cant stop us from how long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses every single day in the newspapers and on the radio waiting for us in that ridiculous castle waiting for mank yes image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his image a man that has shaped his time a titanic figure of limitless influence think about empire a man with an empire at his feet a man like a baron living in a palace a glorious palace on a hill and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him feudal i know who were going to get i the great american biography a journey into the soul of the beast listen ive got it it came to me like a thief in the night pure inspiration total magnificence here you are up with the birds for once you vampire mank you scoundrel what took you so long jesus in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree how big is it all told the estate look at those hands those are the hands of an artist a modern caravaggio hes nothing but a hypocrite he preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress the man doesnt allow drinking or cigars this is monstrous no its perfect when in doubt put on a cape false noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the lifeblood of the actors craft since the days of lrving and booth imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky andalusian plains the great spanish bullfighter manolete sigmund freud howard hughes killed jean harlow how about howard hughes we could do hughes but with compassion and insight we find the man and then we dissect him so weve got to come up with our movie our biography thats better than being the oldest hasbeen in hollywood history not for me magic showing life telling stories forget it nonsense all right enough ive heard this from schaefer and rko ive heard it from everyone again again again again again so on to the life of christ it was fun wasnt it relax george its gon na go great trust me have i ever lied to you its my birthday this week ill be 26 i dont want to sit i told you where graumans el capitan or did radio city come crawling back look not a single scene shot in the studio weve found natural locations for the whole story youre not still mad at me i hope it was a joke george i really think youre that soulless monster gets no tears from me its just that my movie is so why dont you just have the guts to admit it youre with them arent you youre going to bury my movie they bought you do what you can thats not good enough i then well open it in detroit or dallas or kalamazoo for gods sake well show it in goddamn circus tents and then find another theater the ad the magazines are one thing but hedda why did we have to let her come this is an abomination theres no music and ah its a grand title please dont ask me to do this jesus i know i know but what more can you expect of me i have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to a z and a k in the title that would draw the eye for the poster i like that the prisoner of zenda had a z and a p and that worked pardon its an awful title of course but i cant think of anything better someone came up with a sea of upturned faces which has a nice grand ring to it and i thought of john citizen usa but that strikes me as a bit warner brothers or god forbid capraesque i suppose american will do for now but yes vibrant and modern and stark like a picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning i we shoot the whole thing in the gallant american west im christ yes yeah how bout a real drink take apart the fucking camera rig we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up i need my shoes in total focus right here and also joe back there its just not low enough this is the scene we have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring

course from marge and dickie they found this in dickies place in rome a ragione a ragione are you a homosexual interesting nonsequitur he thinks its very cold to be sleeping outside where have you been since then hes taken over the case because theyre annoyed the previous chap let dickie disappear when he was the only he was the only suspect in freddies murder tom is a mystery good things about tom ripley could take some time tom is talented tom is tender tom is beautiful and dont forget i have the key what are you talking about youre not a nobody thats the last thing you are what do you

the future hello what are you up to what do you want to change about this moment tom tom tell me whats going on tom are you okay or i could come back do you want me to stick around are you okay not guilty you look ghastly tom are you okay no key huh probably in my case its probably a whole building but youre still tormented you must be youve killed somebody can you imagine if dickie did kill freddie what must that be like to wake up every morning how can you just wake up and be a person drink a coffee hes already angry i dont think he wants to know if you killed freddie miles and then killed dickie greenleaf he says so many fiances il signor ripley ha una fidanzata il signor dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor freddie miles ha molte fidanzate no by the way officially there are no italian homosexuals makes leonardo michelangelo very inconvenient i dont know how to translate that e difficile il signor ripley dormiva allaperto con un a roma circa tre settimane fa youve seen the papers you know what a big deal its been here american tourist murdered thats good isnt it anyway ive got to the bottom of the delay finally were waiting for someone from rome welcome to venice this place reeks doesnt it can you smell it ugh sorry not the best way to spend your first day that dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport i know ridiculous dont be daft its fine im delighted you finally made it to venice im delighted contrary to rumour youre still in one piece but the point is dickie well we know this dickie loves marge and he misses her and apparently hes come to his senses not at all morning tom well be there i know the piazza di spagna what time and tomorrow will we see you later well hurry before we sink should i give you my telephone number in venice yes what happened i heard you were desperate to come i was looking forward to rowing you around where are you hiding him hes impossible isnt hesure i know thats too dangerous for you fair enough hey were brothers fine then you do this sordid thing with marge fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen which was excruciating frankly plus you follow your cock around like a and now youre getting married im bewildered forgive me youre lying to marge then getting married to her youre knocking up silvana youve got to play sax youve got to play drums which is it dickie what do you really play the funny thing im not pretending to be somebody else and you are im absolutely honest with you ive told you my feelings but you first of all i know theres something that evening when we played chess for instance it was obvious what no no its not a threat ive explained all of that you love me and youre not marrying me yesterday youre ogling girls on the terrace today youre getting married its absurd how you see particularly with the marge problem you can just blame me of course lets say for arguments sake you were here perhaps we could split the rent on a house ill get a job or better still i could get a place in rome and when were there we could be there and if were here we could be here i thought i might come back in the new year under my own steam i wanted to tell you my plan what ive gotten to like it ive gotten to like everything about the way you live its one big love affair if you knew my life back home in new york ha then ill take it as a compliment why why are you asking all of a sudden esatto im always planning ive got plans im suddenly quite happy to be going back to mongibello and the happiest days of my life what about venice can we stick to that plan at least i thought you might write again now that were brothers the thousand dollars of course was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing dickie home naturally i hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way im not going to say anything to marge or anybody the police its a secret between us and ill keep it youve been so good to me youre the brother i never had im the brother you never had im prepared to take the blame whats the fight about thats her fiancee isnt it are they blaming him i was just fooling around dont say anything sorry is freddie here i thought youd missed the train you said i could pick out a jacket and i just sorry i did and then maybe get the jacket and what have you what club freddie its just theres so much to do in a single day where do we find a carozza for the forum or can we hire any of them i cant i cant keep spending your fathers money hes getting impatient he wants me to reassure him youll be home by thanksgiving i didnt mean with you in it means we never shared a bath im cold can i get in no no brothers no sisters your handwriting nothing more naked see nothings quite touching the line thats vanity pretty vile see this the s and the t do you see fine vulnerable thats pain thats secret pain like clark kent now superman now your signature not dickie your signature no ive got more than one shirt copy out from here a few places thats a few jobs anyway i dont want to think about new york i played piano in a few places what and rome i have to go to venice could we sail to venice im doing this wrong arent i your parents met her this is so good of you what time is it oh god do you always type your letters that

persuade my son to come home id pay you 1000 could you ever conceive of going there tom and bringing him back i met him in new york jazz lets face it its just an insolent noise i like to sail believe me i love to sail instead i make boats and other people sail them now okay wait a minute talent the only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance forging signatures telling lies impersonating practically anybody sure im intruding no still here you know a primer its just an undercoat nothing nothing much passing through ripley hullo how do you do well i knew you so i suppose you must have known me its tom tom ripley we were at princeton together i suggest you ask dickie that yourself otellos is on delle croce just off the corso freddie do you have something to say hardly you should watch that no no im staying here for a few days in rome thats a new piano so you prob how did you find him its such an out of the way apartment can i fix you a drink of course hes been very involved in his music hasnt he i think his theory is you know you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly what about christmas hes gone to dinner search the place i cant think why you would imagine dickie would hide from you i guess yes im good thank you dickies at dinner hes at otellos do you know it hello freddie its tom tom ripley who is it hello we could go down to the bar no need for you to you know i feel ridiculous i didnt mention them yesterday i clean forgot ridiculous hello sir marge you should have waited didnt peter tell you id come by and pick you up i feel guilty i feel like i pushed him away i spoke and he heard you i think it might hurt her to know ill try my best sir obviously ill do anything to help dickie yes whats the detective hoping to find in san remo yes it is im well thank you mr greenleaf ive always wanted to go to europe sir but tom ripley thank you sir thanks yes i think we did theres room for a whole libretto on freddies chest thanks so much for inviting me tonight i hope she never knows okay i could probably see my bedroom from here i can see my house when you see where you live from a distance its like a dream isnt it is mr greenleaf here oh marge what i dont know peter has a concert in athens next month and hes asked if i want to go along help out he says goodbye by the way hes in rehearsal otherwise but i hope that note goes to new york in your purse for a rainy day its all true i feel as if you havent heard anything ive been saying to you i told you he gave them to me today for the first time ive even wondered whether he might have killed freddie he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him well you know that marge i loved you you might as well know i loved you and because he knew i loved you he let you think i loved him didnt you see couldnt you see i dont know maybe its grotesque to say this now so just write it on a piece of paper or something and keep it in your purse for a rainy day tom loves me the scent youre wearing i bought it for you not dickie the thing about dickie so many things the day he was late back from rome i tried to tell you this he was with another girl im not talking about meredith another girl we met in a bar he couldnt be faithful for five minutes so when he makes a promise it doesnt mean what it means when you make a promise or i do he has so many realities dickie and he believes them all he lies he lies thats his half the time he doesnt even realize marge where are you going shut up shut up marge calm down youre being hysterical let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this i can explain what marge im in the bath wont be long hes having an early night and you sir any better look at me what thats a terrific idea i was looking forward to seeing him hello marge no well go if you want to but dont talk to the police about my face they find out he hit me hes got a temper he couldve hit freddie good luck marge ill catch up with you later we passed it a few blocks back where the police were the palazzo gioia they dont even know im in rome and im not going to incriminate dickie get on ill take you to him my face there was an argument i

good things about tom ripley dont get up just tell me some nice things peter i i i suppose i always thought better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody i know im lost too im going to be stuck in the basement arent i thats my thats my terrible and alone and dark and ive lied about who i am and where i am and so nobody can ever find me well that would be even better gossip dickie and peter thats just too good gossip isnt it i lied to her she thought shed seen you hardly kissing kissing off was who meredith good but i think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip well thats entirely your fault and if i fall overboard thatll be your fault too i dont know both my plan right now is to go up on deck look at the sunset come with me all kinds of things making plans nothing ask me what i want to change about this moment i give up you try you try talking to her its okay im fine ill fix some drinks im sorry i was asleep i must have fallen asleep i keep wanting to do that fling open the door let the light in clean everything out if i could get a huge eraser and rub everything out starting with myself the thing is peter if then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key say open up step inside but you cant because its dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was dont you put the past in a room in the cellar and lock the door and just never go in there because thats what i do whatever you do however terrible however hurtful it all makes sense doesnt it inside your head you never meet anybody who thinks theyre a bad person or that theyre cruel just because he doesnt like americans no i did not i did not kill freddie miles and then kill dickie greenleaf is he accusing me ask him if hes accusing me what did he say tell him i have a fiance dickie has a fiance and freddie miles probably had a string of them no ive been backpacking in rome about three weeks ago i knew that one its ridiculous but now youve mentioned the stench i can hardly breathe no but i thought that didnt happen in italy that each region was completely separate i was sure that was the what do you mean theyre sending someone from rome its okay what rumour peter im really sorry to put you through this i just couldnt face going to the police by myself when my italians so rotten its fantastic i feel guilty marge doesnt understand this but anytime dickie does something i feel guilty my god hi sorry you okay you look as if youve seen a ghost sorry sorry had to renew my papers italian bureaucracy never one stamp when they can make you line up for three have you been waiting long okay marge see you tomorrow its really good to meet you ten thirty tomorrows possible do you know dinellis piazza di spagna i cant later thanks i am i really am and ive been travelling i just cant seem to get that far north ditto tomorrow absolutely no i have and so has miss sherwood ask her and if i could remember which hotel he was staying at the goldoni tom was staying at the goldoni i have it is a little coarse yes im not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends i think i just said ripley was handling some business for me nor does mr ripley want to marry me nor did he ask me every day if i would marry him and when thank you let her in whats the difference let her in no actually no id like it very much if you would ask her to come back later 31 people its not a pattern its a coincidence there must be fifty hotels in san remo there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day no a few days ago i dont remember the exact date was it did you speak to tom yes sure we did go to san remo that was months ago what about ripley even her i really dont want to see anybody the telephone the press ive been im feeling

saxophone alto you have yes sorry no one has seen signor ripley since san now i think i have upset you my english perhaps is coarse do you have a photograph of signor ripley may i ask why would you speak to your friend and not your fiance that is miss sherwood now marge sherwood 31 people no here is a pattern two days ago freddie miles is dead he leaves your apartment and is murdered yesterday a little boat is found in san remo full of rocks and the owner tells the police it was stolen on november 7th we look at hotel records and we see oh dickie greenleaf is staying in san remo and then our boatman remembers two americans taking a boat does he stay with you here and when did you last see signor ripley november 7th is my information november i thought what about thomas ripley even your fiance never weve had many requests and of course we say no even to your fiance of course what happened to your face no yes exactly but his first his first conclusion was that signor miles was killed

suitable environment for this type of discussion the elderly have so much to offer sir they are our link with history ill keep that in mind sir i wasnt toying with her sir i was just how old are you

profound here maxine we cant exploit it tickets to malkovich yes of course hes a celebrity lots of things hes very well respected that jewel thief movie for example the point is that this is a very

havent heard from him in a long time poor guy i warned him im not talking about ethics im talking about morals that was just talk fantasy talk what are you nuts we talk about girls all the time but it doesnt mean anything i would never i mean i take very seriously our strict moral code the line youve crossed is its illegal and its immoral dave im just saying this as your friend what youre doing is really really wrong and youve got to stop but you havent written your novel in love you did it at your house your own house you could tell dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place and that could get a little irritating sometimes but basically he was a real good guy dont tell me that i dont want to know that a few months before the election shed had an affair with my best friend dave novotny well sherrys great but she can be a little much sometimes yeah no i mean you know fine you know we just went to crossroads yeah just yeah uh just a minute he likes it around that time diane and i were hanging out a lot at sherry novotnys house giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time everythings fine just you know school thank god for diane she was my best friend my source of love and strength oh sure wed had our share of bumpy times but wed always seen them through after nine years of marriage we were closer than ever and the secret good communication larry weve got twentyfive minutes until the assembly and we still have to do counts for vp treasurer and secretary mr hendricks and i have both verified the numbers and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing it happens larry people make mistakes hes right two people must have pocketed their ballots usually its more mostly tammy fans i think weve got a problem larry huh okay well i guess id better do my count larry were not electing the fucking pope here just tell me who won youre kidding right what dyou got all right ill be back i just want to get this over with so we can have the assembly and go home we dont have much time until eighth period i have other things going on too you know fine so do your count start with president and ill be right back what right so lets start counting you will youll be fine what a surprise oh is this god first one of these i havent been in for a long time swallows unsure what heaven or hell awaits him whats this well i i thats very nice of you coming to see me are you trying to humiliate me why are you doing this so tracy and this model comes with abs and dual air bags standard plenty of pep too handles pretty good dont you think anywhere you want just so long as were not gone more than a halfhour so are you looking for something sporty or more practical good for you good for you huh right college wow where are you going where d you get into oh new cars i see well you came to the right place so what brings you here hello tracy that said the whole point of an election is to choose winners and that you have done well begin with president thats enough tracy quit while youre ahead okay ill handle this could you ask walt to come in youre off the hook tammy here has confessed looks like todays your lucky day i agree but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very very grateful the whole school didnt find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations and chances to win certain elections this isnt the time or the place to get into it but there is for just one example a certain former colleague of mine who made a very big mistake a life mistake i think the lesson there is that old and young we ail make mistakes and we have to learn that our actions all of them can carry serious consequences youre very young tracy underage in fact but maybe one day youll understand youre a very intelligent girl tracy you have many admirable qualities but someday maybe youll learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead and yes stepping on people to get there well theres a lot more to life than that and in the end youre only cheating yourself okay tracy so who do you think did it whom should we interrogate 630 how do you know what time the posters were torn down were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend a travesty huh thats interesting because i think you did it i guess you know why youre here look why dont we just forget about tammy well have the assembly tomorrow everybodyll make their speeches and im sure everything will be fine looks like tim kobza as far as i know they calm down tracy just calm down so like i was saying things were going pretty well in my life good luck tracy sure yeah okay well good luck tracy should be easy so far no competition you bet okay fine sure no thats fine looks good to me right you can put those in my box ill look at them tomorrow hey thats super oh theres one more thing about tracy i think you should know now at the end of her junior year tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body and so far she was running unopposed tracy okay but were still missing something key here what are we missing well good luck there tracy yes i do not wasting any time are you tracy oh yeah you bet nowhere i dont have class until second period walt we cant throw her out of the election just because we dont like her speech thats not what student governments about thanks well im going home now walt will be speaking with you about this but i need you to find someone to take over my classes the lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer oh okay hmm life would go on and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience i dont believe you which door and how did you get in the school exactly when and when did you do it looks at her skeptically doesnt say a word what is it tammy so what do you have to tell me possibly please just wait outside just wait outside tammy me i took advantage of you you hugged me you kissed me youre the one who a mistake that was no mistake its the only true

has been doing everything since i thought it was evelyn i think ill do what i damn well please something with the power i dont know ill try not to remember to warn evelyn sorry i wouldnt worry ms jenzen the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long in the meantime lets all relax have a drink the evenings young very good well i think i can say with complete honesty ive never

winnertakeall as the rest of you dont take your eyes off her for a second i think she just declared war no somehow i dont know how she did it it works then who did rewind that i mean not that it didnt give evelyn the kind of coronary i had in mind just hey next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that so disengage his flail arm mechanism and just make him a screamer problem where looked good to me evelyn go stir your cauldron or something for a secoh dear it was on my dads list of things to do but the house did him first problem no problem just want to get my money and get on home you know things to see people to do mr price mrs price somebody hello part of the original structure when it was still an asylum guy who ran the place dr vannacutt found it inspirational from some german cathedral a million years ago driving the demons from the mind not at all names pritchett watson pritchett i own the house my father built it and now i just need to get you into it so over here up here me youve got ta be kidding hail mary full of grace the house is growing okay ill admit it im totally clinically insane but im still the only one who actually got a check tonight its yours if you just get me the hell out of here now uhhhh poor mr price whats life anyway waves sound light electricity i dont know phone lines price didnt make the guest list the house did it wants vengeance thefourth of july yes left goddamnit new wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia 19th century i think what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane the vannacutt version was bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce itd traumatize em back to normalcy hell no the house will kill ya the soul of the house everything thats corrupt about it my father trapped it in there just before he died you see he purchased the house to restore it we were going to live here nothing can live here i was just a kid the first time i saw it i thought it was beautiful it was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room then it started to move then death started to happen first the workers six in all then my father nothing but i imagine well all be mutilated beyond recognition by then a cleaning crews supposed to arrive at 930 tomorrow morning i think the power of the house fades at dawn i lied the house is alive and were all gon na die youll never know til you walk through that door nonsense just bad press all the deaths that occurred inside my own fathers included all perfectly normal fatal accidents im just the greeter and in that capacity i now urge you all strongly to i am vannacutt then i guess then it had to be you sorry house 2 guests 0 i rememberit was a long time agomy father said when the house was finally completed make surewechristenit withthisbottleofdirtcheapchampagne thatshouldstillbein a cupboard somewhere i thinki may have the answer not the plates the house why is no one listening to me its alive and once its made up its mind it wont let anything out wouldnt know what to do with it all my loss its getting older by the second mr price if i could just please have im ready now i cant remember at the moment ten he mustve unsealed the room oh dear he would have been back by now blackburns dead i thought you understood its the souls of vannacutts dead the insanity the horror victims burned alive all that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventysome years singing this will be the day that i die this will be the day that i this this is nothing youve only been dealing with the house itself you have no idea what youre tinkering with sooner or later the darkness that is at the core will get out one of you will release it not meaning to of course then bye bye miss american pie accumulated evil festering for decades but im a drunk so dont listen to me not ghosts at least not what youre thinking vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house i said we shouldnt come down here very treacherous physical and metaphysical levels both thereve been no refurbishments to this part of the house its exactly as it was in 1931 youll never find it its a maze down there the basement but believe me you dont want to go down there believe me we need to wont do any good hasnt been a telephone in this house in over 60 years dont know that it does oh no i cant comment until i get paid he mustve beaten us all here wish i could take the credit but it better be he still owes me 25 grand for renting the place for the night here lets get you some illumination so you can make your way safelyim trying no if you dont kill him instantly im dead and youll only kill him instantly if you get his brain which is about the size of a cherry and even if you were on target a bullet might not penetrate his hide hes not gon na hurt me i need to see his habitat cause this is the cove he obviously lives in it happens when i land and law enforcement such dangerous work the idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring disconcerting lets mate commit your genes to perpetuity youre a beautiful woman i dont know i see blood maybe you got him hank no forget about him being god hes thirty feet long he is a miracle of nature who somehow made his way to maine this is a grand beast a grand dragon an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive so profound and fat then do it that sounds good but underneath its hurtful nightcap sobek half man half croc oldest god just spit him back out some shall live some shall die arbitrarily sound like any higher power we know whats that bite my bishop maybe he doesnt play well with others obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet promise you wont kill me first this is a setback i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless whenever somebody dies i consider it such a waste that i didnt know him better was he a good man no thank you but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log what im saying is if its a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old it would be unthinkable to destroy him crocodiles dont sever with their teeth their molars are blunt no crocodile has ever they dont really attack underwater and this could end up saving your life i keep telling you they can come on land i dont wan na wake up in the middle of the night im laying a spring trap what are you doing jesus christ deep down gut check im growing fond of you and its liberating to say so and you like me could she stay weve tentatively scheduled intercourse they come on land and theyre brazen theyre also attracted to noise you can see i make a lot of it cocktail species keystones affect the entire ecosystem that could explain all these worms the water youve got a crocodile bury your friend well youve got a croc alright theyre keystone species if hes eaten in the area he shouldnt be far away crocs hang around the food source they can survive winter as long as their nostrils dont freeze they survive am i foolish to explain things he had such trouble with my name they have saltwater glands they can swim across oceans its only a matter of time cmon were losing light why does the big one heckle me theyve been migrating north kelly this lake connects to the ocean i apologize i just dont want to lose the light weve got time for a quick scout youve had work done ill need any and all topographic studies womens intuition are there anymore you talk to bickerman no look hes got nothing left where is he thank you jack radar hes underwater but hes definitely coming thirty meters or so moving slow but straight toward elsie i got something on the screen you ready on shore right thats actually the easy part we both know what theyll do jack weve all seen it hes probably a hundred and fifty years old hes bigger than an elephant look i know im crazy but when they come they will kill it they have to politically hes too dangerous if something were to go wrong the odds are he will be destroyed i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out and i think i know a way to lets not overlook he didnt eat me maybe bastard bit my chopper he never said go at school theyd always say go first and hank i know you werent really trying to hit him hes gon na live guess i finally got bit im okay we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs they wont hes taken human life the mission will be to put him down theyre not going to be able to snag him in pitmans tranq him in water he drowns could we have intercourse yes you may but maybe i dont know eh fuck it didnt even sound good im an empty man kelly wealth has robbed me of the dream in life i sit here broken a hollow sack with crocodiles everythings even nothings real im rich people are automatically my friends sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and nothings real you think im that nuts im a civilian you dont have any authority are you sure as if will you miss me two years married divorced used to be a lawyer quit im still waiting on his sperm count and what if i tranq him kelly he drowns you think about that such the flirt whats going on cept he wasnt before was he you know when friends or family members say things they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger youre fat even so youre allowed to boast you look thin by the way ive mentally undressed you i can see your ribcage if hes here ill find him did she tell you we had sex together that hurt my feelingswe wont let him get hurt maam he just appeared you have no idea how he arrived in this lake you killed him mrs bickerman the reason were up here a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake do you know how your husband died just those two she didnt tell us about the other croc cause she was afraid wed blow its head off you take care yeah and every time we think theres no more danger tranq guns down rifles up you shoot on my order if he charges ill be yelling go which means drivers take off and drive fast they can move on land you set almost here hector dont forget to lift up the cow okay lead him in okay everybody up on the trucks we aim for the stomach or side theres little chance the darts will pierce his hide everybody up on the trucks can you confirm visually or just radar where where you do were ready the more he thrashes the better keep enough tension to hold him up hector we dont know if he can swim and again how would you get him on land so maybe wildlife will try to save him theyre more equipped to no way forget it well you can try talking them into that if cause he just ate a cow you stupid hey this time im gon na kick your ass get the gun get your big gun and guard the shore hector go to your tent that was yknow if the guy asks me can she kiss now ill be able to tell him if you can

yeah i thought about that as i was driving and i havent found somebody in my world you found anyone in yours it was something meeting you yknow if we didnt live in separate worlds and if im ever in new york you sure i dont mind you wan na ride in my truck get him onto shore i dont care hank end it back us in a little we need to get a shot take him keep firing you wouldnt hector he doesnt seem to be swimming is he swimming he looks like a giant tea bag it cant work weve got a cow hanging from a helicopter are we crazy we might as well pack just heard from wildlife and florida fish and game they should be here by four no you might think theyre godly you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and you wan na kill yourself that it you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide look calm down calm down really okay okay okay youre mushing it a little around the maybe dont mush it i heard something ssssh we could not say it and well that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to well goodnight thanks for the bandaid thats why youre here to get in the middle of something youre having the best time of your life arent you thank you no thanks who taught you be be a nurse ow shit sorry lets get away from the shore i couldnt believe did you see the size of that things mouth like little children you okay but why maine and why alone crocs are social whys this guy on the move by himself just forget it i was trying to pay you a compliment i was guising it as science cause i know youre comfortable in that arena science i didnt say it like that forgive me for trying to be nice im saying between the moonlight a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off you look good when you get scared the brain releases a chemical same chemical it releases when somebodys in high school the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow look for prints are you okay police want to keep it quiet if the press gets word lake monster they just want us to sit tight no us wildlife is on their way you okay kelly good see ya soon he thinks theyre what night okay were up at six im sorry but youre you flew up here because your boss its too dangerous for whatevers out there did flip over a canoe listen uh hank and i think it best if you stay on shore what are you doing he could be right there and you wouldnt see him if one could be out there why does fish and game tell me its impossible baby crocs well until we see it were not gon na be convincing too many people same thing from fish and game in maine who what well you dont have to stay out here why dont you dont like tents mosquitos look at your fingernails you have about as much business being in the woods and even if they did i doubt he or she would have problems with tents the museum of natural history doesnt send out investigators to why are you here really never been to maine before hank says hes sure big but a bear couldnt do that to a moose or man in water on land maybe but maam your first impression isnt going well did you make anything of the tooth jack wells a museum sent you you too dont count on it we better take him out hector do not move if you get a safe shot where is he even if we could tranq him how would we get him on land you got ta be kidding they wont be here till at least noon we got a few hours to kill get back from the shore we know how fast he can leap out you said nobody came in here hank the little cannon you brought get it guard the shoreline otherwise were done we made the id our job is finished they look like theyre jumping are they feeding whats that you gon na dig up that ladys husband lets go we setgo ahead youre to wait right here until the police show youre under full house arrest maam how could you not report this he puts human life at risk and maam your husband bernie you didnt by any chance lead him to the lake blindfolded oh but you have maam you lied to us that could be obstruction of justice a mans been killed in part cause of your silence i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and im sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows and how would you have accomplished this maam my department doesnt have any record of that mrs bickerman where is he i just have this feeling everythings totally safe gee that would really disappoint me you probably do want to be killed by it that was you trying to meet your maker i can arrest you raincheck im tired hector i know this because youre beginning to not bug me he didnt eat the kid cause hed just swallowed a bear it came from across the lake is everything a big fucking joke to you asia how how could he get here i have no interest in ever looking at you hector could you please cut me down you dont want to cut me down cause ill kill you his head was just bitten off yup i brought a pork chop maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck is this a trick again not to be disruptive do we have a problem with it dying that walt guy got hit underwater again i dont mean to be annoying with my questions but if it is a crocodile which i dont think it is and if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time with you it makes sense i coulda shot you you a spring trap youre crawling around like a what the hell are you doing i do not like you you listen to me the only reason im letting you be part of this is cause you got the helicopter and the radar no out everybody out back to your tents now no whats with digging the holes we are here on official business keystone what wed only just met around here yeah and what would he do come

useless thing in the world is that which is behind me chapter three not really theres a lot more important things id like to put myself into in aid of what yes and i try and teach the students to ask what is it in aid of thank you muffy funny thing is this is an important element of seduce and destory facing the past is an important way in not making progress thats something i tell my men over and over so boring so useless is that still lingering muffy coffee i warned you i get on a roll i just realized this is for television isnt it i cant swear up and down like i just did thats right thats right and what im saying that none of my competitors can say is this that there is no need for insight or understanding things of the past gone over done do you realize how fucking miraculous this is how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of its time this concept is im talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values god damn im good there is no need for insight there is no need for understanding i have found a way to take any subjective human experience in other words all the terrible shit or all the great shit that youve had happen to you in your life and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language the listenerpatient settles into a very light very delicate conversationally induced state not a trance mind you but a state a state that is brand new the systems state what did i do i realized that concept and put it into practical get my dick hard and fuck it use im gon na build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live vote breath pay takes and party till dawn im gon na teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass tit and tail like i said yeah go go go im givin

there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes and theyre names are macready horn and langtree among others i was completely independent financially and like i said one sad sack a shit so what were looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think thats what most people respond to in seduce and at the end of the day hey it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it its about finding what you can be in this world defining it controling it and saying i will take what is mine you just happen to get a blow job out of it

in the universe you and you bob andy needs to relax see if you can get him away from all this take him to hawaii or bali find something special something nice im worried about andy his stress level is

be tony i get to dump the glass of water on someone elses head isnt tony clifton going on taxi soon maybe thatll chill him out dont believe everything you hear that was a really hot houseno dont hate me trinity im just the messenger and right now im going to prove it to you thats what you think theyve promised to back me trinity theyre going to reinsert my body ill go back to sleep and when i wake up ill be fat and rich and i wont remember a goddamn thing its the american dream oh i disagree trinity i disagree i think the matrix is more real than this world i mean all i do is pull a plug here but there you watch a man die yes you see the truth is trinity that we humans have a place in the future but its not here its in the matrix im tired trinity im tired of this war im tired of fighting im tired of this ship of being cold of eating the same fucking goop every day but most of all im tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit you are a beautiful woman too bad things had to work out like this he had an accident hello trinity i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure why doesnt he take him to the oracle she would know theres something about him isnt there yeah course im sure hear what i intend to believe me someone has to you dont do you do you were going to kill him do you understand that hes going to die just like the others you werent supposed to relieve me any time honestly morpheus he got them all amped up believing in bullshit i watched each of them take on an agent and i watched each of them die little piece of advice you see an agent you do what we do run run your ass off dead all dead five since ive been here you bet your ass it keeps him going maybe it keeps all of us going im going to let you in on a little secret here now dont tell him i told you this but this aint the first time morpheus thought he found the one geezus what a mindfuck youre here to save the world you got ta be shitting me what do you say to something like that why youre here have to the image translators sort of work for the construct programs but theres way too much information to decode the matrix you get used to it though your brain does the translating i dont even see the code all i see is blonde brunette and redhead you want a drink the matrix yeah midnight watch no its all right whoa shit neo you scared the bejeezus out of me hes going to pop just get me outta here there was an accident a fucking car accident all of a sudden boom jesus someones going to make a believer out of me i need an exit fastyou all look the same to me and you are hurry i know trinity dont worry hes going to make it five minutes maybe six hes beginning to believe we have no choice give me your phone we found him trinity we finally found him shit apoc go you have to focus there is a phone wells and lake you can make it yes i know they cut the hardline this line is not a viable exit she told you exactly what you needed to hear thats all sooner or later neo youre going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path trinity go get to the basement find the catch basin i know that is why it is so important for you to go please neo im asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me listen to me neo i know why youre afraid to go through that door you cant get free of thinking that i could be wrong you must believe me there is a greatness inside of you neo a greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world no i did not i have never told anyone this neo after i saw the oracle i thought no i misunderstood what she told me i believed that it was all about me that i would find the one not that he would find me yes i do faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots these things are not a matter of cause and effect neo i do not believe things with my mind i believe them with my heart in my gut thats why were here what do you believe in why that i would find the one yes dont think of it in terms of right and wrong she is a guide neo she can help you find the path she is a true psychic she sees beyond the relativity of time for her there is no past present or future there is only what is she would say she knows enough of the resistance yes shes very old shes been with us since the beginning set down in there no neo im trying to tell you that when youre ready you wont have to ive seen an agent punch through a concrete wall men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air yet as powerful as they are their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world because of this they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be every attempt to fight them has ended in failure only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one unkillable but now i believe that is going to change look again no you dont did you see the woman in the red dress do you understand neo this is another matrix simulation a training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson the body can not live without the mind your mind makes it real do you know why you didnt make it im trying to free your mind neo but all i can do is show you the door youre the one that has to step through tank load the jump program do you think my being faster stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place how did i beat you show me your training get some rest youre going to need it i didnt say that it would be easy neo i just said that it would be the truth yes a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines i must say i find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back toasting the new age i say almost funny we have only bits and pieces of information what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twentyfirst century all of mankind was united in celebration through the blinding inebriation of hubris we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to ai what is real how do you define real if youre talking about your senses what you feel taste smell or see then all youre talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain wild isnt it you believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197 i cant say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know more important than what is when youve never used them before your muscles have atrophied were rebuilding them far from it be what be real have you ever had a dream neo that you were so sure was real the pill you took is part of a trace program its designed to disrupt your inputoutput carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location that you are a slave neo like everyone else you were born into bondage kept inside a prison that you can not smell taste or touch a prison for your mind the matrix is everywhere its all around us here even in this room you can see it out your window or on your television you feel it when you go to work or go to church or pay your taxes it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth do you want to know what it is let me tell you why you are here you have come because you know something what you know you cant explain but you feel it youve felt it your whole life felt that something is wrong with the world you dont know what but its there like a splinter in your mind driving you mad it is this feeling that brought you to me do you know what im talking about i know exactly what you mean why not yes thank you but i think we both know theres more to it than that do you believe in fate neo ironically this is not far from the truth but im getting ahead of myself can you tell me neo why are you here i can see it in your eyes you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up i imagine right now you must be feeling a bit like alice tumbling down the rabbit hole please come sit welcome neo as you no doubt have guessed i am morpheus go the the adams street bridge do you still want to meet youre the one neo you see you may have spent the last few years looking for me but ive spent most of my life looking for you they got to you first but theyve underestimated how important you are if they knew what i know you would probably be dead this line is tapped so i must be brief there are only two ways out of this building one is that scaffold the other is in their custody you take a chance either way i leave it to you theres a small ledge its a short climb you can make it good now there is a window open it go now the cubicle across from you is empty i can guide you out but you have to do exactly what i say im not sure but if you dont want to find out you better get out of there yes yes now stand up and see for yourself ive been looking for you neo i dont know if youre ready to see what i want to show you but unfortunately we have run out of time theyre coming for you neo and im not sure what theyre going to do hello neo do you know who this is he is the one he is the one do it tank charge the emp were on our way we need an exit tank good i need the main wetwall how is heyou ever have the feeling that youre not sure if youre awake or still dreaming i dont know my computer right if you get caught using that you got the money youre two hours late who is it thanks for the drink how what happened to them how many were there really yeah do you always look at it encoded is that what are you doing sorry i dont believe it i dont believe it morpheus the oracle she told me no no morpheus dont morpheus i dont know did you believe in them too yeah what about the other five guys the five before me what about them and you still believe im the one why so i can hear some old lady tell me what that im this guy that everybodys been waiting for the one thats supposed to save the world come on how do i respond to that i cant its ridiculous i mean who am i im nobody im just a guy what did i do morpheus why me what do i believe it are you kidding me what do you think im still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real wasnt the whole world my entire life was a lie i dont know anything anymore morpheus i told you i dont believe in this stuff no matter what she says im not going to believe it so whats the point morpheus i dont think this is a good idea what did she tell you she helped you and shes never wrong how does she know and she knows what everything the beginning so is this the same oracle that made the uh prophecy whats going on what are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets how yeah i think i do what what lesson if you are killed in the matrix you die here i thought it wasnt real because i didnt think i would i know what youre trying to do you youre too fast this is incredible i know kung fu for what no i dont believe it its not possible ai you mean artificial intelligence this isnt real right now were inside a computer program when morpheus whats happened to me what is this place why do my eyes hurt what are you doing am i dead this cant be what does that mean what truth the matrix because i dont like the idea that im not in control of my life no youre morpheus youre a legend most hackers would die to meet you you could say that its an honor yes what do you know the agents no way no way this is crazy no its too far away how do you know all this but what if how what the fuck do they want with me holy fucking shit right now whos coming for me morpheus hello what what do you mean without him morpheus he almost had me convinced what im not the one but what honestly i dont know who how did you know shit im sorry what vase yeah youre the oracle hello can you fly that thing im fine come on we have to keep moving it wasnt fast enough do what yeah no youre not what are you doing i believe i can bring him back why im sorry im not im just another guy morpheus is the one that matters im not the one trinity the oracle hit me with that too morpheus did what he did because he believed that im something im not i have to im going in after him that i would have to make a choice there has to be something that we can do i dont know it just went dead is morpheus alive we cant leave him what is it it might have been im not sure a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it nothing just had a little deja vu right as rain what did she tell you did you go to her should i be is it but an oracle can what does that mean i used to eat there really good noodles god emp an electromagnetic pulse get this thing out of me uhoh what is this thing shit why from what what the hell is this what is the matrix who is of what how did you do that do you want to go somewhere and talk i just thought you were a guy geezus trinity the trinity the trinity that cracked the irs kansas city dbase who are you how do you know that name its locked which way which way mr wizard get me the fuck out of here guns lots of guns because i believe in something i know thats what it looks like but its not i cant logically explain to you why its not morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed i understand that now thats why i have to go the oracle she told me this would happen she told me does it i dont know this cant be just coincidence it cant be can it goddamnit i dont believe this is happening what do they want how much time how what are they doing to him see who hell yes holy shit where is it its a city zion you dont have nonearest exit is franklin and erie an old appliance store i got you cypher operator how im going to make the call yes sir got one ready sir subway state and balbo goddamn its good to hear your

theyve got morpheus in a militarycontrolled building even if you somehow got inside those are agents holding him three of them i want morpheus back too but what you are talking about is suicide what are you talking about neo this has to be done every leader of every ship is given the codes to zions mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the matrix they are used only in emergencies if an agent had those codes and got inside zions mainframe they could disable the entire defense system it would be the end of everything when it does morpheus will tell them anything they want to know depends on the mind but eventually it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this they inject viruslike serums to attack the neurosystems its like cracking a computer all it takes is time theyre hacking his mind the oracle hey mikey he likes it ready for more deep underground near the earths core where its still warm you live long enough you might even see it the last human city the only place we got left if this war ended tomorrow zion is where the party would be any holes nope me and my brother dozer we are 100 percent pure old fashioned homegrown human born free

wasting your money fine yes i think that one may be tony what do you think why not all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman oh no this is just getting worse i am going to find myself 30 years from now still on this couch in a depressingly asexual way bella this is anna hes cooking guinea fowl is miss scott staying here it was sort of sweet actually i mean i know shes an actress and all that so she can deliver a line but she said that she might be as famous as can be but also that she was just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her what yes sort of bernie of

life ruined because i dont read hello magazine no did you so i get the brownie definitely no comment no it doesnt that is a cheap question and the answer is of course no comment max this is anna right right fair enough thanks or bambi or i dont know beavis or butthead how about miss flintstone and then double it and that is the what can i say git im living with and he can not remember no thats right i know that she said shes using another name but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate which was a serious mistake ahm look this is a very odd situation im a friend of anna scotts

ike getting a complex buddy order out like a philistine when you got the galloping gourmet here then come for dinner youre coming here no im paying for the dress do you think shes still gon na run yes

spec like its a dirty word nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play plato never got a book advance justice yes paid i dont know they like the idea but my hands are tied with budget restraints then youve got it if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands youll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot if she runs then its a cover story all true all accurate it wouldnt be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again all the gory details vindication how would you like to get some a chance to prove that though your facts werent entirely straight your theory was correct ike

think you should are you all right with this you think this is funny i dont know give me a minute are you all right with this missed me bad huh no but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness attraction is very misleading and if its mutual its well terribly distracting kind of isolated of what can you fix it why dont you let him sleep it off in the trunk ill take you for a ride then well come back for him keep an eye on him hmmm figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album youre not trying to soften me up are you its valuable hang onto it oh my god

tell me when you get to the altar will you spike the bouquet of course bob will be very happy you look uh you look fine agreed no i dont know no i think i said something eloquent like so uh maybe we

waited for the wedding to run always a mood killer well im impressed absolutely incredible i didnt expect pink and lacy but this isnt exactly a womans room you afraid to try i like it this whole thing is pretty incredible i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york cindy the manicurist done five hundred too much youve seen the postits ive already got more juicy material than i need why should i pay you dollar one my magazine doesnt pay because for stories its not what you call ethical really im not a boastful man whats your point i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers obviously im not the only one who doesnt understand it the uss maggie leaves quite a wake excuse me you can turn that finger around look look man i think the man is heartbroken but the most interesting thing here is that i dont see the rose tattoo that ive heard about on your back a prewedding luau nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak how romantic really everest is that right thats fair well see yes conviction conviction that im onto the truth youre going to do the same thing to poor bastard number four that you did to the last three youre going to run again and im not leaving until you do im not here to make you feel bad im here for vindication in my heart weird dreams youre going to tell me about them getting nervous youll answer my questions originality is my specialitywhat what of it help yourself you pompous ass i will be in bed it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves you need rest you need to sleep he is dead you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut keep still constable you were halfdrowned when they found you i do not care you are welcome to use my work area but i beg you return her to her resting place a diseased monster the lenape he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time we must be a curious sight to him what is that to place it inside its coffin i was afraid of this excuse meyou can not do this i am a man of god damn you sir god damn you to hell they need guidance i am the lords voice in this town are you a deist is that it a free thinker who does not believe in divinity no you will not run me out no one will believe a word of what you say for poaching or would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost your superiors are two days away i will not allow it i will not it is sacrilege the heads were not found severed the heads were not found at all why not tell us what you have heard hmm how much have your superiors bothered to tell youhow did you hear this um i i did not no why well enough your gathering does honor to the deceased these woods of yours sound a bit crowded what with all the witches ghouls and indians living there who took the meat then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes excuse me gentlemen but who has seen this horseman if we could speak alone i hit him square i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing two days for murder you are the blacksmith ever shod a horse with a hoof this large well unless your name is baltus you should not worry over mine excuse me miss they have a laugh at your expense when this cut was made this person was already dead this is not lady van tassel no clotting or gathering of pus no healing at all stains of blood would you stay doctor i may need assistance you will stay at her side bring him bring young masbath here brom bones in time doctor soon as i finish the wounds are the same cauterized no chopping or halfmeasures either one stroke took the head have you seen doctor even the spinal bone sliced as smooth as butter he is a behemoth what are you spying on this should have bled by the pint yet no blistering or scorched flesh how whatever weapon was used it cauterized somehow no bleeding why did you move the body doctor i say is there any one person suspect in these acts an honor gentlemen in time i will need every detail of the three murderings youve had but for now i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find father that is the closest you ever come to god you are so upset now and yet you seemed in such good spirits last night he may but not soon enough for you and not on your behalf wallowing quite literally in blood wallowing in sin and lust it is only important what you are an adulterer oh far as i can tell a rumor does not travel alone for long here only if i repeat them outside this room and i will if i must out there for all to hear or you may speak as planned but you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures does that look like an animal hanging then you should have left two days ago because i have men willing to help me today protest to my superiors if you like i can not proceed without examining the previous victims all i know is three are slain their heads found severed from their bodies perhaps i could assist in finding them master hardenbrook maybe you should take this may we look at them now may i see them master hardenbrook yes sir but do you have these do you have these persons wills just a moment are you saying it is he pardon me i shall gladly not for lack of trying chosen me not liberalism equanimity even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused often quite literally but how many innocents rot here and how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets without disrespect look around you we overflow as do our courts our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence but if we were more often able to ensure justice after the fact then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement i could determine if he were dead before he went into the hudson there are surgical ways of telling how he died by the water in his lungs just a moment if i may it is possible this man was murdered is that all you say look at her tell me something what becomes of young masbath more than enough actually i beg you no more please at times i do listen to what you say i know it are you saying i should be frightened is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck well so much for common sense what is that you wear believe why would he flee this direction with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover the van garretts died first a man and his son survived by a wife and two infants and the widow windsor was next the militia how are you i doubt thats the end take the reins i know hold on climb up i can not you should not worry van ripper and his wife will look after you they will you will be well cared for this is farewell you do not know all that has happened you can not understand nothing to hell with this place and all the people here i need time for thinking without you hanging on my coattails for a change things have become complicated katrina is at the mill ride ahead find her and bring her to meet me outside the church find her at all costs quickly fiction plays and novels baltus does not approve now come it may not be long before lady van tassel returns it is nothing she comes to read books so her father will not find her it is absolutely nothing something i really wish i had not seen never mind it did you find the victims loan agreements lady van tassel there are none for magistrate philipse either paasch james pieter thomas pos william did your father take a loan often in such cases property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to and who in this town is owed a great many debts intestate your farm all the farms they belong to no one no one yet far as i can tell it has gone intestate only the heirs were killed proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment and it now belongs to you according to baltus i heard him say it to discover what might have been taken from those who died it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place because i serve a fine purpose alive it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted what was taken from them other than their lives who benefits by their deaths business best hidden is hidden best at night man or woman why this tree must be some sort of gateway but why this place stay back good questions deserving answers of which we are in short supply true enough you grow sharper by the minute little man it boggles my mind but i begin to prefer your company over all others let loose his silent shrieking who knows till we work at it i admit not being anxious to find out he who holds the horsemans desire will guide his reaping hand whatever the horsemans desire is other than extinguishing lives we are far from the hollow loath to say it better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning we should not go much further in this murk how could something named the tree of the dead fail to draw attention we are leaving i hear nothing what is it witches do not exist however if the western woods are truly the devils glen we will see for ourselves now hold the bowl steady back to business i have others all i need is this yes i suppose it is keep it not for eating i assure you watch here are you familiar with magnets look again out there what do you see what is it up his teeth someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth the lenape could not have done that for himself someone out there cared for him the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth we must discover it the reason the murderer chose these persons what is the common thread between these victims young masbath i am sorry for your loss it is a great and sad tragedy however i can not be the one to look after you now i manage fine alone i am not here for revenge i am here to bring justice we have no choice the blades will carry us to the ground face front and wait for me no get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump keep climbing i will follow his horse he moves too fast i do not know away katrina the name van tassel is blackened you share that name what would you have me believe the loans give the land to your father it does not matter survivors are still on their farms they could be thrown off tomorrow a year from now what did he say katrina and what did he say it was you there come with me what what are you doing yes i did notice that thank you why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside he he tries to take the heads they will not pass just keep where you are blood a woman should not be out alone in these woods katrina why do you follow i i do not know i no longer know what i think or what i feel memories have come back i had them forgotten and wish i could forget them again but they are here now lord how i hate this place what happened to your mother is she still alive she is not your birth mother is she lady van tassel she is your stepmother isnt she she bears so little resemblance no actually you were not every word you spoke had truth in it allow me some time i have spent every hour in the company of others i need to be alone if it had been surgery on a living person done to save that persons life you would not question it not for a moment so let me be the first to tell you dear girl on the other side of these sheltering mountains a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours and someday no matter how much you fear it that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber to avenge his father and the others i have no solution for its meaning yet but i could not just ignore it it was not butchery there was no blind stabbing this singular thrust found its target omnipotently as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother the child she carried was eight months grown at least near to birthing the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly you are not regarding it in full the widow windsor had been run through by a sword i followed the bloodless wound a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes no stone may be left unturned it may appear harsh they have done nothing of the sort if these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am i very well but it will only sit gathering dust thank you no here if you want but yes but listen the illusion is easily explained the eye retains each image till they combine and yet some would call this toy magic he only appears to be inside the cage the point being here it is a bird on one side his cage on the other now stare at it the bird seems to be in his cage i have had them since childhood i can not remember what from i um i have something to show you if you have a moment may i ask why do you cover your book that way poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions there is no such thing as magic are you so superstitious extra ordinary yes but first you tell me about the headless horseman which may explain his temperament to have asked twice means the answer was no at least once the massive fellow brom for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy perhaps it is because your suitors hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat small talk excuse me i should apologize i um i have no great love of feel free to form your own opinion though it appears you already have do you often make a habit of sitting on strange mens beds i i am looking for baltus van tassel let her go what it is fine now i must it appears well it has already clotted very little i must be going where excuse me lady van tassel katrina is not in her room do you know i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here yes actually it is a prime tenet of science philipse that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical van ripper do you have a gun turn around now van ripper turn the coach about there was not much blood was there to the best of your recollection where did the open wound fall van ripper can you show where the body lay what what are you doing can you help the horseman yes the lenape who lived in these woods do you know him the redman i should tell you he has been murdered in a way yes pardon you did not answer when i knocked are we intrudingshe has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession do you know what confession is all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul she has confessed she is guilty you do not want to be here go home to your father go hometired what now what can we do lady van tassel take me with you theres nothing left for me here why why are you like this wont you change your mind sir what can i say to convince you shes the one who controlled the horseman isnt she sir sir what now where is she but sir what books where are they what books there are no other doors this is as far as she could have gone no they are all missing what was she doing i was getting worried who was it there is no masbath here my fathers loan papers are missing yes i rode with him on payment days baltus van tassel what does it mean in test what but if the farm is not mine who stole it away yes my father had farm land it was the only thing we owned of any value what good is this if someone has the horsemans skull if they control the horseman then why havent they sent him for your head yet all i saw was their lantern someone left last night looked like they headed to the square but i lost them in the forest we should go what is it then who murdered the old crone and why well im one of the few people who likes you if the crones wound bled hard that means she was not killed by the hessian someone only tried to make it look that way what does it mean climb down to the horsemans soulless place should we go back follow the indian trail to where the sun dies to the tree of the dead maybe we passed it by what happened no crickets or cicadas calling no bird songs listen father said witches live there thank you no i couldnt its spectacular what kind of nuts the western woods its payment day loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month almost everyone borrows for tools or to hire workers where are we going how could he im sure i dont know i did not ask you to did i i deserve to help you dont you see how much this means my father he he was a good man whatever you still need a second to tend to your thingsdid he see some danger from defen when your son came back from the war what did he say about all this what do you mean by dirty looks and when he came home did he write you about this or phone perhaps now defendants father had also died by that point where was the defendant when you sent his family their equity why if they could never take title but back in 34 japaneseborn could not own land so so the defendant knew the deceased your son even then i said no further questions question withdrawn you may step down doesnt it seem to you mrs miyamoto that your mistake was in being deceitful concealing information during the course of a sheriffs investigation well it seems to me so you hid the truth deliberately but if truth was on your side whatever were you worried about why not up in the air was that your reaction and then something did carl heine was found dead with his head crushed you thought the deceased might break his promise so five hours plenty of time for a call he was excited you say in the sense of being overjoyed your husband returned at what seven oclock so then youand your husband must have called friends relatives to tell them the amazing news yes you wereoverjoyed yourself to hear the news and your evaluation of the defendant could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff so quickly there would be no sign of struggle well what then sergeant so wide crosssection of men to evaluate and the day that the defendant volunteered for this demonstration did you find him eager and you were generally experienced in training men for handtohand combat and replaced it later with the new one thats your inference so if defendant had tied up to deceaseds boat with that last one would those cleats have lined up and the last and the next one so noimmediate suspicion nogeneral talk of enmity between the two and you werent there when the coroner examined the wound could you tell me what kendo is and why is that did you say more so when the sheriff returned you showed him the injury to the deceaseds head tht was summation your h youre a hard man to trust sir you sit before us with no expression keeping a poker f all right what did your son say to that effect objection asking the witness to speculate were you sir can you prove one word of all your fancy story and i wouldnt blame these good people if they were a mite resent ful at a tactic that insults their intelligence i asked you a question youre writing a tract h greedy your line of work you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth but isnt the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces and since you confess this is all pure guesswork what is your expertise sir are you a detective of sorts well the freighter the twine the blood the knife the cup the watch the second battery the phantom lantern the fishing gaff the cracked gunnel the skull wound the blond hair thats eleven things everything had to happen just right for your little story to fly i mean a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons objection speculation but carl was a fisherman and successful at it and then your stroke came this summer and you put your property on the market i believe you said september 7 which remember is eight days before carl heine died and who comes spetember 7 wanting to buy mr jurgensen did he offer to buy the seven acres from you robbed he was angry well the sheriff found two batteries in your well if you left one with carl heine how is that possible didnt go anywhere else no errands no purchases just straight to the boat thats the truth i see now what happened the day carl heine was found before your arrest you mean this morning the new story the battery story that one is the truth thats a question sir my apologies do you regret not telling the truth should have told everything meaning you should have told the truth well initially is an interesting word sir youd been arrested you had a lawyer and you still claimed ignorance but even after you had an attorney you still claimed to know nothing claimed not to have seen carl am i correct actually she said you had decided decided not not come forwardi did but the jury wont s look i want to forget you i do i think if you hold me just this once i can walk away and never speak to you again theres no one here and ive got to talk to you the japs did it i couldnt say anything i just stood there hating her we all expect the world to be fair as if we have some right t its just pearl harbor people are a little crazy right n itll be over soon i can get you money there cant be any wrong in this ha well i dont do it for just anybody why were only talking your friends would your dad would kill me with a machete the best part was that there was a this to debate the wrongness of i told myself that was good that it made our friendship special and didnt mean she was ashamed of it necessarily at school she kept mostly to the japanese kids and sort of ignored me as if all of our times alone togetherin the hollow cedar everywherewere a secret but he found you those arent the facts that matter seattle boys think hes guilty they say the evidence is rock solid i felt milhollands report in my pocket and wondered why i wasnt telling her telling someone what id found agnostics dont believe or disbelieve ma we just dont pretend we know no sir i cant not beyond a reasonable doubt thats curious i was appealing to their intelligence thats how journalists answer questions he didnt want to lose any more like you couldnt believe oh yes then putting them together so truth is revealed my expertise is that im a journalist twelve im sorry was there a question in there maybe it went where carl went over the side some seamans loast report stuffed in a cabinet good as lost forever no one knows you mean early morning the 16th how long you have this detail and you keep the records or contribute to em you have the night watch on the radio its on the twine too but its not r youre right i better use two have a look at nothing its public record if the public cares enough to read it wont take two three kids whats she going to do we dont let go you s you ever been strangled by a single hand cigarette the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel just below the mast he hit his head on the way in the freighter started through at 142 the sea water seeped into carls watch and stopped it at 147 then wheres the lantern and wheres the knife maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio which is now working same report milholland heard and that makes him get the lantern fast before the freighters wake can bang it around coincidences happen you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere splitsecond tragedy happens every day or maybe he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there so he climbs up to cut it down miyamoto gave him the battery and left carls boat was running he goes back to fishing but at some point he thinks of the lantern thats when he fell because the second lantern the one on the mast was never found so we have to ask thats what mr miyamoto reported and hed have no reason to lie he couldnt know that it would help his case well it shows the prosecutor was wrong it was carls boat that was dead in the water or hed never have put up the lantern to my father everything counts yes he was youre wondering why i held it its the way it happened i know it ispretty darn clear you bet and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off he coulda left this line behind on carls boat found on carls boat too starboard side second cleat from the stern but it doesnt match carls lines it matches miyamotos perfect from carl heines boat all his were like this one threestrand manila new condition braided in loops not bowlined like miyamotos comes off third cleat from the stern port side and its brand new unlike the rest these are fishermen alvin they dont talk at all to each other and less to me specially gossip nossir id gone to tell the wid to tell mrs heine dont prove there was two lanterns coulda been the one in the cabin you gon na climb that with one arm here now what are you fixin to do never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place you said three minutes i did boy look no way im lettin you out there in a half hour you could be in canada you gaff with the hook end bloods on the butt where your hand goes sure you did help me with this hold cover willya see you replaced a mooring line lately this ones new you always run with the well open we have a warrant to search your boat you said that that was your testimony what else could it be one d6 and one d8 in the well and a dead d8 on the deck the damage was considerable but shes insured thanks again shes alright nels thanks for asking possible but not darn likely he was heavy but we were real careful but i dont remember him hitting anything anywhere i dont think so i believe so apparently no two d6s thats the kind his well was fitted for it was dead we had it tested maybe the d6 was the spare and he had to use it hes done some onthespot refit ting you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d6 it is a little yes you have to wonder didnt think about it at the time so no it didnt strike me odd yessir thered been real heavy fog maybe maybe the assailant straightened the cabin and forgot the cupor from the cut on his hand which is more probable with no bone or scalp or hair present would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a mans skull you dont well if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a mans skull no bits of bone no particles of scalp no strands of hair you scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff where a fellas hand goes and what did you see under your microscope besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings and the blood could not have belonged to defendant seeing that his type is o negative but you cant say with any certainty that the blood was his so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all it was human yes type b positive it is so that makes what would have been 4500 into 7000 doesnt it if you sent the equity back you had a profit of 2500 second question what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre just three questions the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for 4500 thank you mr gillanders thank you for coming down in this cold weather well what if all right what if the defendant heard so carl let him aboard to help and then the fishing gaff course if carl lost both batteries dead in the water his radio wouldnt work so how would he signal for help now the sheriff believed that the d6 battery in carls well was carls own spare even though it was too large f so the fishing gaff method wouldnt make sense im sorry about that it wasnt mine in the first place now if you wanted to kill a man think youd try boarding against his will and hitting him with a fishing gaff now mister gi your honor all of this is speculation including mr hooks dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call objection objection asking witness to speculate about deceaseds state of mind my gosh alvin was i supposed to object every time you did that as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man and an assailant strong enough to subdue himthat leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake its a rare thing takes a turning point naw ive seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes if i whistle those boysll see you and come runnin youre the story today ill take two one for later well anything coulda caused that you think so still and all carl was a strong swimmer he m still a coincidence timing and all the knife what knife but you could be wrong he could have climbed up earlier maybe just as the freighter comes through isnt that quite a coincidence still lashed to the mast fell well why does it now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived one in carls hand the second lashed to the mast tell us why that lantern would be so significant hes looking down and hes not thinking bout the man you were yesterday hes proud of the man you are tonight thats what counts your daddy was quite a feller im wondering how the judge is gon na like my waking up his old bones in the middle of the night this tastes horrible hmmn no you dont i told your wife trials arent always so much about actual truth as about what folks believe is true thats sad and its real i want you to tell the truth you wont hear that from hooks because the charge is first degree murder which requires premeditation he cant change the charge that you came upon carl by accident like you said gave him the battery like you said asked him about the seven acres like you said so every time you think about showing that jury strength or honor or composure or dignity now this jury is gon na be lookin at the evidence with one eye and at you with the oth youre wonderinhow come i never ask if you did it bet theres a few things you could teach me kendo for one i think you like learning white or black your daddy played i asked down at the japanese community center you smoke cigars even though a d6 is too big and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in which makes it a peculiar choice for a spare which you inferred was replaced by the d6 which must have been a spare and her farmhouse how is your motherinlaw operating this winch youd rarely operated before doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 poundsis it possible possible that he struck his head after death possible you dont remember you dont think so is it possible his head struck the transom or the stern gunnel or the net roller as you were bringing him in now youve testified that the deceased was a heavy man and hard to bring out of the net im curious the d6 that was refitted into the deceaseds well was it exactly the same brand and model as defendants so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery hmmn no spare sheriff how many batteries and what size did you find on defendants boat but he had a spare d6 you said right there why not use that now i did some measuring down at the chandlery a d6 is one inch wider than a d8 it would be too large for the deceaseds well you found three batteries you say a d6 and d8 in the well and a spare d8 on the cabin floor correct you have to wonder does it now and yet you started the engine right up with all those lights drawing all night the batteries had that much charge did that strike you odd i think you testified all the lights were on cabin mast net lights picking lights right in the middle of the floor are you absol yes you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceaseds right hand the report says recent origin how recent as much as 24 hours before death but you are certain that he died by drowning and that you cant say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was is it possible so if his head struck something narrow and flat the gunnel of a boat a net roller a fairlead could that have can you tell whether an object moved against the head or the other way around or would both look the same in your motorcycle example those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object rather than the reverse yes your report says death by drowning which means he went into the water alive and breathing and the report is accurate meaning that he wasnt murdered first say on the deck of the boat and then thrown overboard so thisfoam you found in the lungs how does it get there the question is more about the defendants attitu sorry about that mrs heine shall i repeat the ques you can speak for what he said just like you did for mr hooks carl ever say he got one those dirty looks defendant ever aim one of those at you of course not but it was emotional a friends plea set against his mothers attitude i guess youd have to guess not having been there with them having to guess whether your husbands report was word for word accurate so the defendant was encouraged to hope or could have been well he didnt say no did he didnt say no hope existed so your husband said hes think it over encouraged mr miyamoto to believe he might sell to how you cant do this to me this isnt fair you sons a bitche ow that hurt god dammi pillow montana doggy my head hurts i said how would you like to

reason i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert and need to to give a great performance but what i want to know is how fear works in a group malcolm this is essential work im doing just think what my research can do for education elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports where loud noise is random this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read come on malcolm its only seven ohms its nothing its like a joy buzzer and its not about the pain its about the interference with concentration whatll happen to us nell come on no nell the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here nell you will come here now why would we want to do that nell i hadnt done a study of how group fear affects individual performance mass hysteria is like a story nell a communal story someone starts it then we all add a little more to it and then for some reason no one knows how we start believing it

turned things around there 180 degrees you must know ian emi in london i work with ian pleasuredownstairs at the front jesus bblack ffive the wilsons and their three kids they run the place look man ive got to get to another hotel down the road martin lives there he took your money hes got a safe i need a doctor just me martins gone back to the ambassador look i dont know i dont know man i dont even know friedman that well i man youve got to get me out of here the company we all work for the company i dont know this is just a delivery place man i swear i dont know where the kids are i work for martin thats all martin knows he works for friedman he knows what kids finsbury park were in finsbury park what yeah the diplomat no no i swear who martin hes martin yeah this morning he left this fucking bloody morning jesus man my knees i dont know hes gone hes gone i dont fucking know where i swear hes gone on holiday yes friedmans the fuckin austrian who are you jee fuck youre fucking mad you fuck you whathaha yeah what about that road back there though it says closed to the public doesnt it nobody huh how come all those soldiers out there getting bored thirsty come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps hot these roads all round here closed to the public whys that military bases huh i guess theres space enough for war games must be good for business mrs de moraes must have taken it hard eh her brothers death no thank you ill be fine you wouldnt recall if the brothersinlaw left together would you by the way laurence were you here last time your mistresss brother came over you know just before he disappeared when will they be back could i speak to carlos or deborah de moraes i was asked here by a mrs spitz that might depend on where youre going thats right the dead can wait why the hell couldnt you divorce the man your parents arranged the visit to my office what do you suggest so you did talk about it huh get to the point will you your flunkey said he was expected back tonight we you and your parents killed your husband do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser deborah and then your brothers not buried yet as i said earlier an autopsy will you know something ive just seen so much ugliness i dont think id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time id hoped to have a private word with adonis but if thats the way you want it well i hope you enjoyed yourself to get me killed perhaps it came to me while dying in a californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little we all have to like what we become cowards included we achieve this by complicating things a little but its never that complicated really dont you believe in simplicity where is that what happened adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice something like that what was the idea husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed a fright five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright and you still havent told me why you sent me after friedman are there truly no extenuating circumstances five years of it surely youd have divorced him if he disgusted you rich young beautiful you must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids is there anything to understand i dont one just doesnt tell me what does one speak about huh why did you send me after friedman to atone for your sins you dont say oh no at long last leon had found a mission hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned your husband killed your brother and thanks to you almost got me killed too kids are not your thing deborah youd have been ready for me when i turned up with sleeping beauty damn it then too i should have paid more attention not leon you said it struck me at the time but obviously not hard enough you didnt say my god or whatever else wellbred ladies squeak on hearing uncle henry misbehaved not leon who then you sure were right about one thing deborah the job was too formidable for me i should have thought a little more before i left for los angeles but there i was focused so hard on friedman id stopped thinking nothing added up leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15000 a go infiltrating the world of child traffickers duping friedman into selling him a little boy you sure were right the job was too formidable for me but you knew that didnt you your brother stumbled upon adoniss little secret didnt he and traded his silence for a kid and some cash and adonis fell for it bought him his kid sent him away and then killed him when he came back for more leon didnt come here to borrow money for prints he came to extort a second kids life your flunkey let him in so his visit couldnt be concealed hence the exhibition story there was no exhibition just as you suspected remember deborah leon does his own prints wouldnt want anyone to interfere with his art i should have paid more attention to your words perhaps its the way you say them not in the strict sense of the word no he was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when i caught up with him later i doubt friedman ever even met leon deborah friedman dealt with select customers as for my envelope had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called lamont when we met in los angeles leon didnt hang himself deborah your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide how did he do it eh strangulation drugs no doubt an autopsy will tell leons not found your parents worry talk of hiring help to find him even mention their manhunter friends perhaps and adonis panics takes control brings me in reckoning a small time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward not before leons found anyhow he must have kicked himself when he learned id exceeded his expectations adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in epping forest didnt he seemed like a good idea an exjunkie obsessed with death the perfect candidate for suicide he just forgot one thing forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery english november an englishman might have thought of that but a brazilian does the name pierre dreyer mean anything to you hes a client of mine and a friend of your husband what do you mean no mrs de moraes tell me did he kill his little victims too it must be tough being married to adonis to end up sleeping alone every night sleep must be hard coming whats harder the thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if or imagining what he does with his children i take it you learnt to live with yours then take it all the minddulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your wellbeing you knew he had nothing to do with your brothers disappearance didnt you i guess the news youd sent me after friedman didnt go down too well eh when did you learn about his taste for kids huh on your honeymoon or was it later when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother how did you find out did he confess try to convert you perhaps or was it womans intuition or just the way he fucked you you know hed have had him killed dont you does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind deborah or is it just cold expediency could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married ive had a long and unpleasant day im tired and im angry but mad not yet i paid leons boy a visit this morning found him alive and well why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note eh how did you break into my office deborah ladies of your standing dont learn to pick locks between shopping trips come on deborah acting dumb doesnt suit you who knew id found dirt on your brother huh who knew it was in an envelope taking me for dead whod want to make sure it didnt fall into the wrong hands you what mrs de moraes you what or is it the other way round the children are needed because you cant satisfy him whats in the bag underwear to seduce your husband or is it for your own recreation tell me how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms is it because he does it with little children black suits you arent you curious to know about friedman youre repeating yourself mrs de moraes why dont you ask when i left the mondrian how are you mrs de moraes uh wait a moment mrs de moraes yeah goodnight mrs de moraes not yet the place i hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address ill give it 24 hours he just might show up if you need to reach me ask for mr lamont paul lamont all right are you all right the mondrian room 504 the number is 266 7548 plus the la code have you got a pen you do want me to keep the job dont you mrs de moraes minimizes the risks children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses these can also be used to move women and drugs anything that makes money really the hotels are useful capital investments the kids liquid assets my guess is they own hotels across the globe and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot you watched the tape friedman and his people dont just provide little kids and videotapes mrs de moraes theyre in the importexport business they run hotels here in london which they probably use as ware houses and ports of call for their merchandise well i found a little more than that let me put it this way last night i thought your brother might be dead tonight im convinced he is that said i have no evidence and i advise you to let the police deal with it the man who sold the boy to your brother you could say that and friedman left this morning for los angeles thank you for coming come in and close the door will you you drive a hard bargain couldnt nazi hunters do the job why me mrs de moraes why should such wellconnected people as you hire a small time french detective to look for their missing son mrs de moraes i was hired by your parents mrs de moraes perhaps i should come back when youre excuse me the question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything mrs de moraes look mrs de moraes however much of a let down it might be your brothers not back to his old weekend tricks impressionable as he is he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses tried moving on to bigger things came upon more than hed bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table have a look at it mrs de moraes i told you i had bad news i cant tell you that yet but hes being well looked after i will of course do my best to hang onto it i need the money to smooth my way you understand now have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place mrs de moraes and having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise you dont mess around with child procurers right now my guess is hes either on the run held captive or dead i understand your misgivings mrs de moraes but ive seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man leon bought him from if anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man which leads me to why im here at such a late hour i need 20000 in cash by 11 this morning you seem surprised could it be you dont think that badly of him after all you neednt worry it seems his motives were pure from what i can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse theres more your brother also purchased a young boy for 15000 its a snuff movie prime paedophile material im told it retails at around 4000 i see you dont require a definition i found this at your brothers can it be that you want your brother found now you are confusing me mrs de moraes i dont know he seems to delight in so much sisterly love he might become determined im afraid i have bad news mr de moraes i have reason to believe your brothers in trouble was it cash mr de moraes the 1000 you gave it to him in cash is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan what about you mrs de moraes and that is the last time any appearances can be deceptive mrs de moraes can you tell me how you spell a call box thats odd where exactly yes im trying to reach a friend but i cant get through the number is 01766 770 471 the word for those things is croissants croissants like that croissants a coffee and a couple of croissants nothing sticks to slime emily this should cover what you lent me i can the question is can you lie to your ex husband theyd never let me go and youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me what about your friendly cop its up to you whether they walk or not then find another way im finished here and im tired emily you shouldnt be here now dont make it worse call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid can i have the keys to your house do you know a friendly cop no one saw me but the italian and a dog i blew up their generator they thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing it might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up who knows who cares you wanted slime you got slime some italian i picked up back there hes in the boot of the mustang friedmans dead they killed him what some kind of organ factory pregnant girls doped up babies theres a lot of people back there theyre holding a seminar traffickings the past breeding the future whos the guy whos the guy nom de dieu had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate id have had to kill him i think so and if it comes to it tell the cops anything you think will make them move whatever you came up with couldnt come close to how bad it is bye now route 395 past edwards air force base and about half a mile before a place called the red mountain motel theres a dirt track with a closed to the public sign it leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere if you havent heard from me by morning send the cavalry okay but not before you hear get a pen and

those damned mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting rippedoff by their friendly cross border guides are you misterfine he showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street no in fact id seen him a couple of months earlier he was quite depressed his work wasnt getting anywhere he said he was going to try something new realism london in the nineties documentary stuff you know no yes three thousand pounds i still he apparently the hostility was all hers leon didnt it hurt him they used to be close their parents were in their forties when they were born you see and mostly away they grew up in a scottish mansion with old nannies and servants he our world was so old and cold we shone for one another leon used to say his sister cut him off after she got married he never understood why but thought it was because she had no children was bitter er yes the nineteenth how come you didnt know hed come prepared he had something besides shiva sleeping beauty the disney film well it looked like the disney film it was something else i couldnt watch im sorry its just you dont look local oh i she just moved ive got her new its in my book in the kitchen wait thank you yesyouyoure not going to take shiva away my sister she lives in the next valley albert albert and ethel why theyre german jews came here before the war they both lost all their families in extermination camps but they themselves never went near one the idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting leon its not guilt more of a curse and then theres something about his parents being involved with nazi hunters but i think thats just one of leons dark delusions yeah but he didnt beat the demons a quarter of all the shoes sold in europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire all started from a small shop in the east end of london and war reparation money for holocaust victims thats what he said i tried to dissuade him told him i couldnt take on another child that hed get into trouble i mean people who sell children but he wasnt listening i guess he finally found himself a crusade his family think hes back on drugs eh huh leon did drugs a lot of drugs went through his selfdestruct phase you know things to come to terms with demons to fight some peoples minds are gloriously uncomplicated not leons he did beat the drug though he did he just said he had good reasons we didnt quite make it as lovers leon is a good man though what are you going to do now call the police take him away i must warn you hes terrified of men so youyoure wrong i just called to ask if i could stay with him next time im in london thats all you thought wrong i havent seen leon for months leons not here how did you get here phil doesnt know where i live no what do you want here how do you know me whats a french private investigator doing here a private investigator youre not austrian reach for it and throw it to me and my fingers on the trigger you hear shut up wheres your wallet wheres your wallet have you got a wallet this is private property the public footpath is back to the left of the bridgenobodys going to hurt you turn the car around whats in the other direction where were you going you speak english do you speak english its like i said you dont really know lieutenant john epps very well do you if i give it to you will you let us go so you can give us away just keep quiet you dont know john epps very well do you that why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert tell me something wes are you crazy greedy or just stupid jaeger says youre crazy wes wes we thought you were dead and we thought we were next hanging around to get killed wouldnt have done anyone any good we thought what about jaeger suppose i dont go for that and let me guess who is lot of good you were when i was sinking in the sand we been down this road i told you how it is unless you feel like theres something you want to do about it i out rank you thats why no its murder and i wont be any part of it ive got no stomach for murder we are not at war you and i and jaeger are awol we have no authority im not going to let you kill him youre out of your mind you dont know that you said he was a deserter doesnt matter whatever he wanted he didnt get it weve got no need staying around here its light enough lets pack up and head out hows he going to want the gold he couldnt even know we had it whyd he come in our camp stop it what happened get off him get off him then get up and do something about it i told you when i straighten someone out they stay straightened this is how it works nobody touches the gold except when were on the move and someones carrying it nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it agreed maybe i do youve had your say wes now leave it we started this together and were staying together so theres no point in splitting things up now what about it itll be too dark to make our way back now lets bed down for the night and head out at first light all right ill go up then you send up the gold and i dont think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins wes well send the gold up then me and jaegerll climb back i heard got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up doesnt hurt to have a look out either all right lets break out some utility shovels lanterns and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting me and jaegerll climb down and see what we can see move so we wait i dont know theres a lot of space up here they could be just about basically but the map has been pretty precise so far i dont think itll be too hard to got to be some kind of landmark something distinctive should be easy going from here stay on the pass straight to the dot let me see the map picks up again just on the other side not much of a pass were not going to find anything standing here lets get to climbing all weve got to do is make it to the top theres nothing we can do we shouldnt even be here in the first place i dont want to see people killed any more than you but we try to help out we die and all we do is die theres nothing we can do all right lets get out of here ready you just go when i say go break it out weve got rope maybe thats all the iraqis could afford okay maybe they got it on discount maybe the fuse is messed up or maybe its going to go off in two seconds and we wont have to worry about getting jaeger down off there all well have to worry about is finding the pieces i dont know and i wasnt about to mess with it how tough you have to be to make the army all youve got to do is shoot a gun and stop a bullet hes not so maybe we are crazy for doing this but if we do it we do it right i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldnt have to do it again you two fightings not going to get us anything low on gas got to refill they shouldnt have been out this way thats all im saying this is miles from the battle lines they were probably deserters they shouldnt have been here wha were going to keep driving why yes jaeger i believe it is i know you think this is crazy but a couple of hours from now youre going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there yeah welcome to beautiful iraq land of enchantment and riches im thinking about when this war is over why you figure im here cause i got tired of being president of gm if a brother doesnt play ball or deal drugs there arent too many big money prospects around and im not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies wars so i say if maybe theres something out there what the hell thats what i say better grab up some sand to take home to your family a casual one there you go jaeger just find the buried treasure and youre a millionaire help im being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory its a fortune box can you eat it if you cant eat it i really dont care what it is like learning arabic youre gon na learn arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here you know so much about the middle east you know where we can get something to eat not up to us up to the iraqis all they have to do is get out of kuwait hes going to slow down hell slow down well make up some kind of lie they wont find the gold thats what i hear dont matter girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold id go to australia lot of land not many people i think after this id like to quit people for awhile and the girls go crazy for brothers down there australia how the hell should i know i dont know thought you were going to buy a car what dont make so much out of it only reason i havent figured a way to get all that money for myself is because ive been too busy figuring ways to stay alive believe me if i had a minute to catch my breath i might have played things the way you and wes had im no better than anybody else ive just been busier threatened to blow my brains out thanks yeah then im a rich man somebody has to you lie in the middle of the road look like youre hurt when the car stops i run over to the driver and put a gun to his head a cars got to come along sooner or later when it does we jack it you shouldnt think about things like that itll just make you crazy we had a deal no one touches the gold until were out of here no one breaks the deal no one had anything to worry about its always been like that when you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up i figured id bettertake precautions i rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own it wasnt the gold it was the claymore mine the golds in my pack damn it we lost the horses we go this way no but i figure nows a real good time to start me i say you dont have enough brains to be stupid wes you come up with a better plan let me know with what against how many i dont know i dont know they killed wes shiites i think we keep going thats what we do we ignore them maybe they ignore us sun rises in the east we go the opposite direction may not find anything but at least well know were heading towards saudi arabia we cant stay here even if that wasnt an iraqi soldier its only a matter of time before some show up get all the water you can carry and well head out on foot an iraqi shoot them dont go bitch on me now you were going to kill me kill them i dont have a weapon well youre going to start with a bang cause youve got four of them to take down and then shoot them slip out your m16 they must have thought we were iraqi when you yelled to them they couldnt tell in the dark they must be saudis its a saudi checkpoint oh sweet jesus come on come on what did you say thats if the war is even still going on way things were shaping up its probably long over even if they are iraqis probably all theyll do is take us prisoner for awhile got to figure were still kicking their asses in the war they dont want any trouble well we should identify ourselves we can head back for our lines and they dont even have to know about the gold couldnt be syria we couldnt have gone that far north its got to be saudi come on place all alone like that must be a boarder check point the deal was no one touches it until we get out of here dont you touch it weve got to keep moving while theres still light no its a desert thats what deserts do at night they get cold okay then we go this way we cant just sit here weve got to start moving so pick its got to be going better than this if we can find the hummer or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay weve got enough water for that but we wont make another day otherwise damn its all right i dont like it but its over now makes two of us yeah you still got a map on you sure yeah well me too is it all right if i stand up that helicopter passes and the only thing were close to is death and you youve got it all together first wes now you well lie what do you mean no they can fly us home we need something a flare a signal mirror what if hes not we cant just leave him we got to go back we got to go back for wes well find our way well well find our way you think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time youre wrong and youre not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it were heading northeast theres another pass on the photo we can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up and it should get us back down we should head northeast it stays as it is were halfway home now lets not blow it by people getting ideas not when youre up here with the gold i guess not what the hell took so long all right you go up ill send up the gold then follow someones got to send the gold up it cant get on the line by itself jesus jaeger hes not going to leave us what what i wouldnt know i never imagined this not in my whole life did i ever imagine this yeah bwana you got it its just a mongoose its giving i feel air probably opens up outside somewhere thats where the light comes from couldnt see it with the lanternon get up off your ass and dig get up and dig it looks like youre not doing anything what are you doing a whole lot of nothing right now i wouldnt be surprised if eartha kitt showed up singing send in the clowns if they land we can take them if they dont land then weve got nothing to worry about they cant shoot us in here were not going to do anything just stay down stay low i hope it means something otherwise something like that not enough were out numbered and out gunned theyd cut us to shreds theyre doing more than slapping well its iraq im not sure but im guessing that has something to do with them being here iraqis a bunch of them single shots doesnt mean a fire fight thats not a battle going on dont shut up and listen i didnt have to stop anything cause nobody was going to do nothing were in this together understand youre not losing trust are you this whatever it is if we step on a mine well know it was let me see the maps wes is right if there were any more mines we would have found them hell that one you stepped on was probably old anyway left over from the war with iran when we start running suck up your breath youre going to get the wind knocked out of you youre going to be fine me and wes each going take an end of the rope run our asses of and yank you off the mine it falls asleep and you die so wake it the hell up its not falling asleep youve only been standing there for three minutes i

whole new train all right all right itll be okay i mean eventually itll just run out of steam the machine was stopped it seemed like a perfect time to disable it whyd you have to throw it into full throttle oh i see an easy plan my god hes so excessive god in heaven what is that my hat is off to you sir of course not it was in your book oh well then lets kick some ass id love to stop him but have you noticed the hundred armed men i dont have to tell you what that would do to our careers what president grant is my pleasure excellent detective work sir you should have the honor of going first what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coots mining claim oh no we split him fiftyfifty you said it popped out too easily nothings ever good enough for you is it i adjusted it my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case i spent three years on the stage you know remind me sometime to regale you with my lear this im testing a new spirit gum to see how it holds relax were almost there got to be somewhere thats hot he said it was damnably hot its a town willard yes and a much nicer one than ours whats this youd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen it is oh damn thats it shhh come on tell us something a cylinder recorder my own design know what this is you go ahead ill stick with loveless thank you can you fill me in here theyre so precious when theyre asleep strange youd think hed have this place better guarded i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun uh how long ago was this so what happened well that too so spontaneous all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot if you dont mind my asking were you always the way you are which is why were heading to houston texas home of the loveless steam engine works jim are you all right thats right thats good damn it this is ridiculous hey i tried the board its a repeating steam cannon could i just point out this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention garrison then the president was right except its not a foreign power its a bunch of die hard rebels trying to make the south rise again all that jumping and kicking what was all that back there good i wasnt sure you were up to it now what was that come on jim im serious dot dash itll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it yes now observe you know your morse code almost as well as i then weve got our proof excellent and where do we find this fortunate scientist whoa jim maybe but we cant arrest this little pillar of society on maybe quite come lets mingle jim people talk to foreigners speak more openly especially to those as famous as i chauncey mcneil armstrong english lyric poet come llewellyn dont tarry my disguise and here doyle once around the park i need a moment to prepare absolutely have to look for clues even if it means dancing with beautiful women limestone quarry yes starting with a screw now its not fair of me to expect someone whos spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what im doing here but potentially this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain yes aha a brass screw aha ill work on it well its the only one i have its gotten me out of quite a few tight spots try what good lord man the world is changing and mark me it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention we as defenders of the right must keep pace always hoping or this attractive buttons yes but yank one off toss it and poof it emits a cloud of sleeping gas gadget guy while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses i am sir in my own humble way a man of science sorry didnt mean that just a little device of mine ay theres the rub take a look at this file on professor morton quite a brilliant fellow metallurgy a giant hydraulically operated microscope that explodes or maybe just someone who hates scientists eight scientists eight different fields of endeavor hydraulics optics ballistics wouldnt dream of it if youre implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion then i for one am fully prepared to do so al fresco funny i was just thinking you should do the same since i am already in residence and am obviously the man for the job its been grand making your acquaintance sir and best of luck in all your future endeavors interesting mine say the same thing and they dont mention you not even as a valet although we could talk congratulations unfortunately my train is about to leave and i really must insist you disembark valet you jest of course i am a us marshal artemus gordon bach hes the composer j s bach time for you to get off maam well see he had this little wagon when he was a kid but it

well hell maybe we do have a chance theres only seventyeight weve got to stop him right here now with that armored steam engine of his itll be a slaughter i know i know artemus you ready for this his next target is albuquerque oh thank you not likely there must be tracks of twenty different wagons freight wagons carriages buckboards when we find him he is mine so the idea is if a guy punches me he really hurts his hand not again and people are actually fooled by that what is that we oughta get a couple of those rockets voom were there before we left damn i wish this thing would go faster that rules out willard vermont willard minnesota willard new mexico its not a guy sounds like a train looks like a train no record of him hes going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard its better than nothing this is good sure its a windup thing come on lets at least see if we can find dr pemberton sure we have no idea whats going on you really enjoy yourself dont you i find most criminals slip up somewhere you might have mentioned you had that i was six and ever since my policy is act first and worry later those kids they took my wagon never got it back nothing much to it really when i was younger i got into a pretty bad runin with the wyler boys i saw them coming but i didnt act fast enough secondguessed myself and it cost me cost me dearly spontaneous i like that

the things not that fast we just follow it whenever it stops were there waiting at least i tried something never seen a gun fire so fast im going to hit you and if theyve got dr loveless building weapons like those flying bombs they just might do it that oh its a kind of chinese fighting i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco her big brothers were kind enough

mansion easy to get them mixed up i say we invite ourselves to the party what about the explosive starting with a screw is this leading somewhere aha that should put us ahead of the criminals your little jackinthebox gun that might be useful all right if itll make you happy ill try that no offense but all i ever need are these and this you need that real often wait a minute now i know where ive heard of you youre the gadget guy then why kidnap them why not just kill them put them all together and what do we have but dont pull that again youre quite the wordsmith fiddle boy but nobody

empire the first ive even printed my own currency call it what you like the point is i was heir to that land mr west it belonged to my beloved grandmother now i intend to have it back my own country these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression exactly you are on foreign soil you are a representative of the occupying forces or havent you checked a map lately has it penetrated that adrenaline addled skull that you are surrounded by seventyeight of my loyal followers you are in my domain philistine still alive hmm i suppose that doesnt bode well for poor bruno restrain yourself voltaire hes just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant and do give me some room voltaire youre breathing on my head i hate it when you breath on my head talk about what oh about who you are and all that sir i believe you have only two barrels really must be a dangerous business very good sir i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade thank you i confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says i can not have when youre three and a half feet tall sir life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not come with me wont youi love christmas in turkey weve got to get out count to twenty ill be there count to twenty when you get to twenty open the hatch it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink just wanted to put him on edge like riding a bike hes sealed himself in we go down to the torpedo bay if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower m is dead elektra would control it all because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world made to look just like an accident nuclear she just upped the stakes all her chips are on the table now and ms life is part of the bet i was hoping you could tell me makes her look even more innocent elektra king its part of some plan she dresses it up like a terrorist attack the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium i did kill us she thinks were dead and she thinks she got away with it then its no longer a bomb alright then brunch when this is over we should bury the hatchet celebrate a champagne dinner with this bond shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing heres your imposter hes paid off the men on the plane outside theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility theyre flying it wherever he tells them couldnt make it splitting headache dont know any doctor jokes yes viktor davidov miss i could come for a second opinion perhaps after this test its just a scratch i need you to pass me fit now molly is maybethe inside woman theyre getting their weapons from the russians but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons i cant help thinkingthe person close to king the one who switched that pin the report king bought its a manual renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead the worm on the hook again hes not through yet renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in hes working for someone someone who wants to stop the pipeline and they hired the perfect killer one with a vendetta against kingand you that which does not kill me makes me stronger he survived sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist renard who the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra i was the one who brought that money in i took the initiative caviar capital of the world matchless beluga firm yet subtle largest landlocked body of water on earth oilrich hitler wanted it stalin beat him to it its barely a scratch the dome broke my fall shes not a girl anymore who buys classified reports for three million pounds old friend constructions not exactly my line the name your last chance give me the name and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss who did you get it from which is neutral no doubt havent you heard the news so is she shell get over it consider me ungrateful you will never touch her you will never get near her who is it revenge isnt so hard to fathom whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it indeed im sorry you knew him well perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs yes one last screw elektra its not too late eight million people neednt die noone will believe this meltdown was an accident was this all about the oil so you killed your father you turned renard all this because you fell for renard wheres m not interested im coming with you he used your exact words i think you do you can drop the act its over we had a runin he and i he knew about us he knew about my shoulder he knew exactly where to hurt me or did you steal it from your old friend renard a little does it matter after all whats the point of living if you cant feel alive isnt that right elektra isnt that your motto how did you survive shush not at that price time to surrender i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end if this little show is for my benefit ill take you home right now what the hell are you doing here two shaken not stirred i have to go to work no youll be safe here i have to go you should rest i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met i cant stay its the only way out youre not going to were alright no always wanted to see the upper lines i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone especially kings daughter the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue doesnt want to see you take over its not the pin your father wore its an exact duplicate inside is a tiny electrical detonator we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice someone who worked at this company does this look familiar to you how long has he been with you who is he is that why you want to finish the pipeline funerals arent exactly memorable yes how appropriate the right kind of explosion in the right spot it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea where this is too big for even you where is it wheres the sub going and the payoff on the tables no the truth she thought i was dead those blades were meant for you what do you know that she would kill you for nowwhere were we you are out of your league shes working with renard she dropped a million and half dollars to the house your house and you didnt even bat an eyelid she was paying you off what for whats your business with elektra king shes no innocent this is my nuclear consultant but you would have something to gain by killing robert king and stopping his pipeline how high up does thisarms dealing go off a highpowered paraski that was trying to kill me if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with stateoftheart russian army weapons mafia warlords diplomats and spies consortiums from every country in the world a nice little rats nest you of course i need some information valentin zukovskythe inside man then robert was right about a russian connection get out to the pipeline find the insider who switched the pin if your instincts are right renard will be back he hasnt completed the job the pipeline is still going forward and we have elektra to thank for that now robert is dead he got his revenge the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata killing off his sense of touch he feels no pain he can push himself harder longer than any normal man the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out so renard killed him when interpol found the xrays there was mild jubilation effectively hes a dead man how many deaths is he responsible for how many innocent people you may only get one shot at a man like renard same circumstances id do the same again sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his ownresources at first when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post he came to me i advised against paying the ransom i knew it was renard i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him claude serrault aka its a message he wants us to know hes back im well aware of your stake in this 007 if you have a point get to it you havent been given an assignment in this case who told you to look at elektras files and now its up for grabs a goldrush far more oil than anyone thought 007 what do you know of the caspian sea well at least it turned out to have some purpose ive scheduled a medical for you elektra running king industries ive known that girl all her life im not sure she knows what shes walking into since oxford i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world hes a man of great integrity quite the opposite in fact
