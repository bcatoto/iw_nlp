than in the rest of my life at least it feels that way where does he live why cant i meet him now its not quite the same thing ill admit its confusing from the outside youve got to see it from the inside yeah well mostly out of gratitude for being chosen thats where grace comes in god first chooses you then allows you by grace to choose him of your own free will more or less he has to thats predestination if god is omniscient if he knows everything and he wouldnt be god if he didnt then he must have known even before the creation of the world the names of those who would be saved i is for irresistible grace gods grace can not be resisted or denied and p is for the perseverance of the saints once you are in grace you can not fall from the number of the elect and thats the tulip i can stop if you want be that as it may u is for unconditional election god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved the elect and he has chosen them from the beginning of time l is for limited atonement only a limited number will be atoned will go to heaven t stands for total depravity that is all men through original sin are totally evil and incapable of good all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord its an anagram it comes from the canons of dort every letter stands for a different belief tulip like are you sure youre interested in this they believe in the

feature film i was told you were the man to come to no i walked up dont ride elevators what do you think of that or this cool off huh hows this for cooling off i dont suppose youve ever seen this girl before either her names kristen but i suppose youve never seen her i got a picture here i want you to tell me where to find this woman i been asking everybody nobody knows anythingbig threat tv would ream you if he has anything to say about it yeah ive been asking a lot of questions and i dont like the answers im getting hes made a lot of people nervous including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star youre going to thank me for this you know what the medias like they love this kinda shit if that guy goes off halfcocked and gets himself hurt youre going to have so much bad publicity you go home pilgrim theres nothing you can do forget this place start over but im here to help you what happened pilgrim who the whore no shes just a victim a dime a dozen dont do anything more ill find out what i can you know its possible to buy anything on this earth you can buy child whores slaves you can have people raped killed one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan he usually isnt in this country howd you hear about him whered you hear that name like what im sorry about that have you found anything out youve got to tell me listen pilgrim youre way out on a limb here you dont know what youre into nah they dont care about some faggot hustler theyre more interested in your daughters health and yours like i am i felt like such a shit pilgrim after what i did to you not that i did anything wrong that i kept investigating poking around theres some poor sob in la with his face all bent out of shape who youve damaged his movie career lucky for him people dont look at his face but this is my apartment im only human you know oh fuck off you should stay where you belong i aint cheated you pilgrim this is research damn it that girl could have told us something i hate it but you got ta know buddy a lot of strange things happen in this world things you dont know about in grand rapids things you dont want to know about doors that should never be opened ive known more about this sort of thing than a man should dont ask me why yeah probably the police they know less than you do it was called slave of love when i bought it next time its sold itll be called something else wait slow down a film like this 16mm cost two three hundred dollars sold outright shown in peep machines maybe theatres maybe not is almost impossible to track nobody makes it nobody shows it nobody sees it its like it doesnt even exist i dont know i bought it at a store in la i dont know theres a little stall theatre up here its closed now but im borrowing it for an hour i think theres something youd better see yeah all over even here in grand rapids theyre legal now yeah you ever seen any of those do you know what a hardcore movie is have you ever seen any ah pornographic movies jake i dont know ive got some news your daughters all right at least i think she is this used to be a real city i was here about fifteen years ago embezzlement case it was always a little religious for my taste but at least it was a city with a downtown and all what are you paying me for can you meet me in about an hour at the pantlind hotel im back in grand rapids yeah mr van dorn i suppose but ill tell you jake im like a little animal when i get my teeth into something i never let go if your daughters here ill track her down as i was saying ill pick up the thread theres a number of ways i can go theres not much you can do here stay if you want maybe itd be better if you went back home go through kristens personal stuff ask around maybe she knew somebody out here look i do this a lot i work at a minimum rate of 75000 a week it may seem like a lot of money to you but it aint you could hire cheaper you are hey im a private detective van dorn you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids ive been to that scumbag town its full of them no i didnt think she was let me get the picture here let me guess she was an absolutely clean girl a model daughter she never had rebellious or impure thoughts she didnt fuck around let me ask you a personal question a painful one the first of many tell me was your daughter the kind of girl to run around to ah play practical jokes maybe andy dogshit worse yet they dont care those cops like all cops are intelligent enough but they are masters of deductive reason that is you ask them what three and two are theyll tell you five but if you ask them what five is they go blank thats speculative reasoning and thats where i come in to his own daughter huh maybe maybe not ive been on another case all day i suppose i can move it over seven fifty a week plus travel expenses ill tell you that was an interesting case the van dorn girl ive handled runaway cases like it before usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid she pops up in about a week everybody denies ever seeing her but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home well i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice in fact certain people for this girl and nothing i guess i gave your brotherinlaw sort of a raw deal im off that case he fired me im staking out this beer bottle trying to find out if ill finish it or itll finish me ssh im on a stakeout who van dorn you must be kidding yourself honey you think once that guy finds his daughter hell care about you oh no what you gon na do get a job youre taking a big chance the guy who bought you that ring granvilles looking for you anyway you know granvilles looking for you niki look again billyboy this is jail bait could get you in a lotta trouble i want you to take a look at this girl here shes been in some porn stuff you dont have to get uppity with me bill i remember when you was running that car wash and couldnt make it go and what was that other thing you tried a dairy queen went busted toowho the fuck knows the four aces he goes there that film was a fake everythings phony who you wait here ill find out where she is i dont know what youre talking about what do you want do i know you from somewhere meet me here today at seven oclock with the money then well go see the film take it or leave it umhm you got the five hundred i dont know no ratan but i may be able to help you out its not me of course just helping out a friend itll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening who told you about this youre talking about real excitement what is that a kind of chair i never heard of no ratan what you got in mind do you work for the san francisco police department or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency i hear you got money to spend i hear youre interested in interesting thingsright and the cooling unit on the other and then we run out of food and oxygen oh no oh no boy do i feel a lot better its a straight shot back to the colonies and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt any bets on the top bid oh god oh dont know maybe well be real lucky and he just broke his neck i knew we shouldnt of come down here dont know broussard got hurt somehow wed be sitting ducks in the freezers you cant tell that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits it makes me sick to see him like that but this thing uses it for blood its eating a hole in the floor how about cutting it off we cant pull it loose but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer where its stuck to his face well cant we kill it i mean we cant leave the damn thing on him yeah but how his nose and mouth are blocked how does he breathe where did it come from yeah well maybe he should have i mean you brought the goddamn thing in here maybe you deserve to get slapped the flamethrower it must have stopped moving im not getting anything whoevers doing the herding is gon na have their hands pretty full i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once its inside and to serve as as what we really need is some red meat in here for bait should we go outside and bring him in the flamethrower needs more fuel good thats good how oh no we cant fight this thing theres only six hours of air left were dead men oh my god thing is im about out of fuel listen it sure didnt like this flamethrower at least it cant get up here now sounds like a rough one we cant pump poison gas down into the cooling unit itll flood the whole ship maybe we dont have to its trapped in there we could just leave it in there all the way back to irth dont worry it wont damage it itll just give it a little incentive i think i could cobble something together a long metal rod with a battery in it give it a hell of a shock the machine will bring his temperature down his vital functions are strong yes hes running a fever yes well what the hell good can we do in here we cant grab it it might jump on us now were in for it how could anything be indigenous to this asteroid its dead what do you mean ill come with you careful dont get under it hey now what is this that thing god almighty didnt you try to get it off him boy thats terrific if you press the button right now it will blow the whole nose of the ship off just keep your finger off the button till shes way away from the ship thats all hey look somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat this should do it we can use the flamethrower what about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold thats the only reason we came out here wed have to abandon them all wed be broke blow the ship up we cant kill it on board its huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body and broussard got caught in their reproductive cycle well i suppose that starshaped thing could be the parasite that got on broussard is that what you mean recognizable in that we sure need this flamethrower you mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him listen hadnt somebody better check on broussard that must have been when he got it this is horrible whats happening up here it doesnt make any sense it paralyzes him puts him into a coma then keeps him alive oh god what is it i cant tell anything i keep my mouth pretty much shut but i dont like hitting jay this is cleave meet me at the main air lock three blips theyre coming this way ive got em theyre back on my screens why you chickenshit bastard but they dont know about the translation they could be in danger right now what do you mean no im getting nowhere the whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission i think we should go after them what what was that im trying ive completely lost their signalbreathe deeply whats wrong i think thats a pretty reasonable request hell youre in great shape youve got your sense of humor back dont you remember how do you feel dell what was that dell i lost you do you read me are you okay in there take care dell you want to come down we can figure out where to go from here can you see anything in the hole can we come up you want to try what is it i cant what is it im on my way whats up this is chaz just machinery no youll follow me martin were going in im going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on appears to be a door hanging open the entrance is clogged with debris im sending do you hear me martin would you run me an atmospheric then take her down is it solid whats the terrain down there activate lifter quads dell i want greater magnification more surface detail i want to see what this place looks like except it will take 75 years to get a reply back dont forget how far we are from the colonies martin gravity any rotation can you get it a little closer where the hell are we dell plot our location sandy scan the whole sky just hold it hold it computer have you attempted to analyze the transmission computer what language was that play it for us please a transmission computer this is captain standard what conditions are you talking about and be right back all right but do not go below decks no i dont want us separated meet us on the bridge be careful its huge now so its trapped in between now we have to drive it out it looks completely different from the first one its more like a worm with legs and tentacles all right roby and melkonis will go with faust hunter and i will make up the second team i hope not no we cant afford to lose that much oxygen were going to have to flush it out so does anybody have any suggestions oh its okay ive had better cag than this but ive had worse too if you know what i mean just hold us together till were in space thats all what its really on there tight then why the hell are you sitting around here and when will you be ready to do that jay hows it coming on the repairs damn it how long to fix i cant the acid will pour out let me go first you stay behind me well now we have to herd that thing up here it will be no the risk is too great perhaps after weve destroyed the thing the ships gravitational attraction must have drawn him back right weve got a lot to accomplish lets get moving you cant say that i think its a good plan we can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely once the lifeboat is in space if we could just get the creature into the lifeboat we could launch it into space and blow it up its time for drastic remedies i dont buy that theres still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers does anybody know what happened weve got six hours left thats right we cant kill it on the ship but we can at least keep it at bay and maybe drive it into the air lock wed better seal off the lower maintenance level at least trap it there got a better idea while the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net the only other thing i can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out dont be an idiot how do we locate the creature good get on it but first im issuing a standing order from this moment forth every one of us will wear protective garments including helmets lets get down to the locker and change good can you do anything for him still unconscious hows broussard maybe we can catch it no dont open the door we dont want it escaping the door was closed it must still be in here maybe it wasnt always dead well those things out there arent the same you know the spaceship and the pyramid theyre from different cultures and different races that ship just landed here crashed like we did the pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous you know its fantastic the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form and now we run into a veritable zoo ill do it the rest of you continue there should be coming through about there ask him it wouldnt come well how does it feel to be rich men its over hunter and you and i will bag it and then well take it to the ventral air lock got it all right then when it gets to the other side of the door you sing out then drop the door okay lets get moving with this net are they close come on lets go above and see how theyre coming with the gear i can see youre putting your spare time to good use let me tell you something you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough theyll be peeling you off a wall ive seen it happen we came out there well go back a long time by the clock but a short time to us thats the one about the albatross right i thought id find you here well have to trap it somehow if we had a really strong piece of net we could bag it room by room corridor by corridor weve got about a week left right well have to catch it and eject it from the ship the commander normally has first publication rights were going home were in hyperspace too primitive its a pre technological construction that slab was engineered by an ironage culture at best that sounds a little fanciful it appears to have healed itself no thank god just missed him were just plain lucky that could have gone right through the hull taken weeks to patch it its stopped lets let the machine work on him how the hell should i know come on give me a hand lets get him out of there it wont come its stuck help me im going to try to get it off dont touch him watch it no its coming there it caught but what can we do hes out of radio contact heres his line we can haul him out of there if we have to if we dont hear from him soon i think we better go in after him whatd he say cant tell these weather conditions could erode anything fast doesnt seem much doubt about it does there who knows how far whats wrong you lead all right now just remember keep away from those weapons unless i say otherwise martin do you read me just settle down sandy you get any response yet well we cant go anywhere in this darkness how long till dawn dell show me that on a screen computer whats the frequency of the transmission sandy can you home in on that beam sandy you want to give us some vision kill me no good its eaten too much of me no dont that was melkonis it ate hunter look kill me and you stand aside while we drive it in then shut the hatch launch the boat and all right martin well be in touch with you on the communicator yes and maybe launch the boat and blow it too if the others are injured now if we can get it into the boat we wont have to blow it up we can just eject it into space its stable it doesnt hurt to drop it here carry these but the ideas good if we could just turn it around somehow no it wont work and i just realized why theres only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat only one of us could survive but the lifeboat cant accelerate to light speed thatll blow the ship up lets hear it that kind of remark is pointless now come on i want to hear every suggestion you can come up with no matter how wild at least were rid of the damn monster it must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship can we get to him which presumably means then that tomb must have been some kind of fertility temple where they stored their eggs and maybe held mating rituals that next thing there six legs tentacles thats the thing we saw in the food locker well yes theres a pattern but its meaningless to me whats that supposed to mean how did it get so big right now lets keep it closed lets be democratic the man would need protection obviously as well as some way to drive the thing before him what do you think now we go in go ahead jay once we kill the thing we wont need the food any more we can go straight into hypersleep also it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies it may be fouling them all i guess we open the door and net it it started crashing around right after we locked it in foodstorage room weve got it up here its trapped get up here fast these will be very useful at least we wont have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands all right heres the battle plan were going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship whoever finds it first catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock clear all right so thats what weve got a week its plenty of time thats okay he can remain in hypersleep until theyre ready to treat him i think the best thing to do with broussard is to just freeze him as he is itll arrest the progress of his disease and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the colonies quit complaining were in space you bet we made it martin set course for irth and accelerate us into stardrive lets take her into an escape orbit take us up they seem native to the planet its got an atmosphere and a dense gravity its dead now but once it must have been fertile i cant lean on faust any harder hes been working nonstop on the engines im sorry to say it looks like you were right in the first place martin we never should have landed here look at these suckers no wonder we couldnt get it off him what film he went into the pyramid alone we lost radio contact with him when we pulled him out it was on his face it wont come off not without injuring him good martin this is an order open the door we cant leave him out here open the door you hear me martin open the outer door its some kind of organism its attached itself to him let us in were coming up now open the outer lock door cant talk now broussards injured well need some help getting him into the ship yeah we hear you were coming back tell you what martin as soon as the engines fixed well its obviously intentional some kind of attempt at communication maybe its a symbol that means something to them ive always respected your opinion martin if something worries you it worries me still worried find anything we missed but martin it appears to be some sort of spacecraft were going to approach it martin uh weve found it good im getting you clear too lets just keep the line open well we wont need pressure suits but breathing masks are called for sandy can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source anything else any microorganisms good moisture content nontoxic but unbreathable pressure sandy how far are we from the source of the transmission what the hell happened turn on navigation lights its out of focus well its finally happened lets hear it this is chaz speaking sorry but we are not home our present location seems to be only halfway to irth remain at your posts and stand by that is all sandy contact traffic control all right tycoons lets stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at handi dont know what youre talking about get fucked two whole drums get out you can keep your fucking fuel no absolutely not how far do you think you can push what kind of people do you think youre out of your skull what whats

bitch sir well whos in command here soldier wheres your co anyone got a cardi see and you are really a gardener arent you youve become quite a close friend of eves havent you mr chance in a day or two yes yes i suppose thats true hes gone chauncey hell yes walk youre meeting the president arent you its five of youd best get on in there why thats terrific chauncey he does does he oh youve heard oh my god i only wish that benjamin had your recuperative powers anyway the president offered to sit in for ben at the meeting quite a nice gesture i felt hes due here soon i believe were you going somewhere benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his financial institute today but obviously the strain would be impossible how about here chauncey any soreness i swear chauncey between you and benjamin ive got my hands full say that is coming along the swelling has gone down considerably any pain here shame on you chauncey you should let me be the judge of that please sit in the chair chauncey there you are what are you doing on that leg and please call me robert ill send wilson up to take you for xrays mr gardiner feel free to use the telephone and please let me know if you have any discomfort fine would you like me to speak to your personal physician good keep your weight off that leg mr gardiner in fact it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two if that would be would be possible since benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs i can promise you the finest in care unless of course you would prefer to go elsewhere oh i see well then youre a very funny man mr gardiner you caught me off guard i must admit then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys an attorney thomas whos thomas yes are you planning on making any sort of claim against the rands just to take the proper precautions mr gardiner id recommend we take you downstairs and xray your leg by the way mr gardiner i would like to ask you something straight out you can pull your trousers up now however with injuries such as this i have run into minor hemorrhaging which really isnt too serious at the time but can cause secondary problems if not looked after its good that there was no apparent damage to the bone but not for long now youll barely feel this it wont hurt at all the injection will ease the pain and swelling mr gardiner its not good ben im sure you can feel it and you benjamin must be strong and brave for me turn over please some pain is to be expected and i think what would be best for the two of you is a good nights rest its late im afraid its time for my patients to prepare for bed that is so true youre different chauncey quite different than most men to everyone im afraid the government controls are so restricting that the medical profession as we know it is being legislated out of existence i think wed better go look for him david you really care for him dont you eve i dont think so he should be along soon he walked off hes resting comfortably now theres no cause for alarm yet eve this has been an exhausting day for ben no eve im sorry at times yes but thats not an uncommon reaction to such an accident actually i found him to have quite a sense of humor how true mr gardiner may be a welcome change of pace not necessary but preferable i dont think hell be a bother he seems like a most refreshing sort of man a rather large contusion but i dont feel there is any serious damage id like to keep an eye on him though i suggested that he stay here for a couple of days good god eve youll freeze out here fine thank you mr franklin i see mr franklin i must ask you and miss hayes to keep this incident with mr gardiner to yourselves theres no telling what he was involved in and the matter

morning mr presidentcertainly glad to be of help of course doctor i understand well he said it was his he walked us through it another thing that baffles me doctor what was his connection with the deceased major financial dealings obviously but our firm has no record of any such transactions and he told us that he had been living there since he was a child working as a gardener he showed us a room in the garage where he said he stayed and i well i didnt really believe him of course but why the act i think you do mr chance however i will reiterate this house is closed and you must leave call me if you change your mind about signing cmon sally lets grab a bite very well mr chance if you insist on dragging this matter on but i must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon if indeed you do reside here you will have to move out but you wont sign correct come now mr chance good thats good then if you would please sign a paper to that effect mr chance assuming what you say is the truth i would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceaseds estate what are your plans now mr chance mr chance the fact remains that we have no information of your having any connection with the deceased do you drive this mr chance are you related to the deceased mr chance have you served in the army we shall need some proof of your having resided here mr chance come now mr jennings had been bedridden for thirtyfive years since he fractured his spine mr chance that was twentyseven years ago 1952 joe whos joe then how about medical records could you give us the name of your doctor or your dentist mr chance perhaps you could show us some identification with your address a drivers license a credit card checkbook how were you paid how were you compensated for these duties you say you performed do you have any proof of your employment mr chance any checks from the deceased any contracts or documents since you were a child how long have you been living here you live here we dont have any record of that youve quite a sense of humor mr chance but all kidding aside may i ask just what you are doing here louise the maid but she should have

keep you posted we have word that the soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on gardiners background so far they havent come up with a thing whats more as a result of their eagerness one of their ablest agents blew his cover we have him in custody at this time sorry to disturb you chief but we have new developments well sir it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power but we ruled that out as they invariably are provided with too much documentation too much american identity we uhdont quite know what to make of it yet sir but well keep on top of it mr president well come up with the answer yes sir well we do have data from honeycutts sources chief but it isnt pertinent we uh have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at mr rands home and uh right chief no sir right chief yes mr president we attempted to contact mr rand but he was too ill to yes sir we are aware of all that but still we havent been able to no problem chief gardiner yes sirgentlemen needless to say there is going to be a full congressional investigation of your respective operations good night and what do the boys around intelligence think very well can we rule out inefficiency gentlemen i didnt call you here at such an hour to make accusations i just want to explore the possibilities now i have three questions is the man a foreign agent or have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient or thirdly have the mans files been destroyed now id like some answers wonderful well all look forward to seeing you is eve around id like to say hello you will honor me and my family with a visit wont you spring and summer yes i see fall and winter yes indeed could you go through that one more time please mr gardiner in the garden do you agree with ben mr gardiner are we finished or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives now ben did you happen to get a chance to well mr gardiner thats just fine with me im a man that appreciates a frank discussion be seated please mr gardiner oh really hello i can certainly understand that its not that i just oh no sweetheart

days i want the standard file you know that this is not what i requested i do not want benjamin rand disturbed you have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of chauncey gardiner if you run into problems alert honeycutt ill be in the office at seven in the morning and i would like to have it at that time ive got to take a leak hes an advisor and close personal friend of rands for christ sakes they have volumes of data on benjamin gentlemen i quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown and put it through on a code red i want it as soon as possible kaufman im going to need information on mr chauncey gardiners background mr gardiner take care of yourself ben now ben i wont have any of that why dont you listen to your good friend chauncey this is a time to think of life im sorry too well nancy wanted me to send along her best to

many times and yours sir chauncey gardiner how poetic chauncey a name of uncertain meaning and gardiner a bit of the french a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers a beautiful name my friend ho ho a dash of american humor vladimar skrapinov yes it is very good so you know your krylov in russian do you mr gardiner i must confess i had suspected as much all along i know an educated man when i meet one so you know krylov yes tell me mr gardiner do you by any chance enjoy krylovs fables i ask this because there is something there is something krylovian about you bravo bravo our chairs are indeed almost touching and we want to remain seated on them correct we dont want them snatched from under us am i right because if one goes the other goes and then boom boom and we are both down before our time you see and neither of us wants that do you agree and i have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues so why not a coming together an interchange of opinion we may find my friend that we are not so far from each other not so far to exchange our thoughts what does a russian know about business on the other hand what does an american know about diplomacy mr gardiner i wish to be quite candid considering the gravity of your economic situation shouldnt we the diplomats and you the businessman get together more often yes so ive heard a shame as you know we in the soviet union have the keenest interest in developments of the first american financial corporation we are pleased to hear that you may fill benjamins place should he fail to recover be seated please mr gardiner im sorry we havent met sooner mr gardiner i had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and i listened with great interest to your downtoearth philosophy im not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the president tell me mr gardiner just how serious is benjamins illness i did not want to upset mrs rand by discussing it in detail regretfully mrs rand i shall yield the pleasure of your company to others how is my dear friend benjamin feeling you must sit with us my friend we have much to discuss hmmm take this down i want this quote included in the tass coverage chauncey gardiner in an intimate discussion with ambassador skrapinov noted that unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes i see clearly such interest on their part is of great political significance but where was this man gardiner before last week what do you mean there is nothing thats impossible quietly please mr gardiner for one understands our language yes what have you found thank you colonel big business i could work with that faction quite nicely colonel novogrod a coup detat of course that was foreseen by lenin himself that could be possiblemy daddy doesnt hit me silly why would my daddy hit me he hits me

him an ice itll kill twenty minutesobjection your honor counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings objection your honor counsel is harassing the witness objection no further questions thank you mrs phillips can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr kramers care of his child your honor id like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at mrs kramer were you a failure at the longest most important personal relationship in your life mrs kramer how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult your honor i would request a direct answer to a direct question does she have a lover how long do you plan to live in new york mrs kramer were you congratulations mrs kramer you have just rewritten matrimonial law you were both divorced mrs kramer oh what do you call it then a success the marriage ended in divorce so you were a failure at the longest most important relationship in your life how long was that would you speak up mrs kramer i couldnt hear you whom youve seen twice in a year mrs kramer your exhusband wasnt he the longest personal relationship in your life then we dont really know do we when you say permanently if youre planning to remain in new york or even to keep the child for that matter since youve never really done anything in your life that was continuing stable that could be regarded as permanent is thatpermanent do you have a lover now more than three less than thirty threepermanently how many lovers have you had permanently well i can certainly understand why you left him did he ever fail to provide for you was he unfaithful a heavy drinker would you describe your husband as an alcoholic did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way now then mrs kramer you said you were married seven years is that correct its going to cost we can appeal but i cant guarantee anything ordered adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child effective monday the 23rd of january that the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child four hundred dollars each month that the father shall have the following rights of visitation every other weekend one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the childs vacation period thats it i cant tell you how sorry i am the judge went for motherhood straight down the line mr kramer would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child do you want the kid or dont you look ted i dont honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him good youve hired yourself a hell of a lawyer mr kramer how old is the child thats if we win if we lose you could end up having to pay your wifes court costs as well first theres no such thing as an open and shut case especially where custody is involved got it can you describe the relationship between mr kramer and his son how often do you see mr kramer and his son mrs phillips how long have you known ted kramerthe prospect of losing my child not particularly doctor i attempt to conduct my social life discreetly at the moment i am seeing no

new ones at your moms shell have a bed for you in your own room what dont you understand pal bigger than a principal the judge sits in robes in a big chair the judge has thought a lot about us about you and me and your mom and he has decided he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment and im very lucky because even though youll live with your mom joanna ill get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month becausewell thats what he does hes a very powerful man billy sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced theres a discussion about who the child should live with the mother or the father now there is a man who is very wise hes called a judge and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with no son i didnt get fired ill tell you what well do okay how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little tv and then we get packed to go to

joanna go fuck yourself joanna go be a mother get married have kids dont get married have kids do whatever you want i dont give a damn just leave me out of itand leave my baby out of it such as joanna i dont give a are you out of your mind youre the one that walked out on him remember you want what youve been living here in the city he is you sat in that coffee shop across from school you have i cant help but feel somehow its my fault i keep thinking i couldve done something stopped it look at us joanna just like any old married couple having dinner who would believe it fine so do you where are you going okay i understand and i promise i wont try and stop you but you cant just golook come inside and talkjust for a few minutes cmon joanna you dont mean that youre a terrific mother what what about billy i heard you joanna i promise i heard you im listening joannabelieve me im listening my wife is walking out on me after eight years of so weve got problems everybodys got problemsthats normal now listen before you do something youll really regret youd better stop and think joanna whatever it is believe me im sorry okay okaywhat is it this time what did i do now that represents a gross billing in excess of two million what i thought you might just like to know that at fivefifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon are you firing me jim jim this is garbage this isnt anything like what we talked to revlon about none of it you cant all right jim you said i was running this show right you said no decisions without my approval right well what the hell is this whats going on jim i dont jim this isnt anything like what we talked about its not even close what the hell is this night jim jim i appreciate what youre saying i mean it but i really think joannas coming back i dont know jim i dont know jim this whole thing has happened sopow like that im going to be okay the way i see it joannall come home its just a matter of time me ive never been better i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine you want to know the real kicker the real kicker is for the first time in my life the first timei feel like a loser wow jim ive got to go im already late i dont think so jim maybe i shouldnt have but its not a year from now is it and yeah now in haskins vs haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby but it doesnt work that way a major decision was handed down by the appellate court in 1969in the case of haskins vs haskins so naturally you assume that since joanna left that would be a compelling point against her right i dont want to hear another word against him not another word hes a wonderful man a wonderful man no no i dont believe it jim oconnor would never let anything like that happen he gave me my shot in this business if it wasnt for jim oconnor id bei dont know where id be hes a wonderful man sowhats so terrible about that how should i know i dont believe you i cant ive got billy to take care of what okay phyllis whats up do you and mmmmnphill

she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriagewell i guess most of what she said was probably true there were a lot of things i didnt understand a lot of things i would do different if i could just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could changebut we cant some things once they are done cant be undone joanna says she loves billy i believe she does so do i but the way it was explained to me thats not the issue the only thing thats supposed to matter here is whats best for billywhen joanna said why shouldnt a woman have the same ambitions as a man i suppose shes right but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex i guess ive had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent jesus christ did you have to be so rough on her i dont know johni mean to be brutally honest im not so sure what kind of mental shape joannas in right now yknow she admitted she was seeing a shrink six fine look she walked out on her own child right thats desertion right mr shaunessy im telling you its an open and shut case no but john what if she kidnaps him what she wants what i dont

getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it thelma do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially did it ever occur to you

you dont it goes to court now so far its all dead ends no credit history no employment history his bank accounts only five years old and it started as cash were even trying to trace his furniture but for now all we know is hes independently wealth well educated and totally insane we may never know how he got that way he cuts off the skin if his fingertips thats why we cant find a single usable print in the apartment hes been doing it for quite a while keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back go start picking up the pieces well shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner thats not necessary youre in hows that i dont have anyone else to give this to somerset you know that and nobodys going to swap with you i guess decide for yourself i dont know what it says im going to go hes being arraigned tomorrow theyre hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go but i told them not to expect it we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house how you feeling well there he sits its not supposed to make sense its always been like this i heard you know cant you feel it yet cant you feel that feeling youre not going to be a cop anymore come on what are you going to do with yourself out there yeah i thought you might want to be filled in greed it was written in blood there was a second have you heard youve left unfinished business before i know what youre thinking okay you dont want to get in bed with this every night but its different now youre retiring in six days youre all the way gone whats this im declining this case it dont work that way hey so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins but this was a fat guy the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him and writing on the walls happens all the time its like the fashionable thing to do so what this victim announcing whathe had a gun he had a gun and he made it happen he made me do it he made me put that that thing on oh christ he made me wear it and and he told me to fuck her he had the gun in my mouth she was she was on the bed she was just sitting on the bed what what and and and he said he asked me if i was married and i could see he had a gun in his handyou didnt know her pretty head i visited your home this morning after you left its surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct what time is it its not too far away now it doesnt matter who i am who i am means absolutely nothing you need to turn left here at the traffic light what do you mean hello because i envy your normal life envy is my sin i want you to know i wish i could have lived like you do here he comes youve made a good life for yourself i wish i could have been a normal man like you i wish i could have a simple life its close and i remember breaking your nose youre only alive because i didnt kill you tell me what it was that gave me away what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air really just biding your time then toying with me is that it letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in youre going to be remembered and its all because of me and the only reason im here right now is because i wanted to be you should be thanking me a woman so ugly on the inside that she couldnt bare to go on living if she couldnt be beautiful on the outside a drug dealer a drug dealing pederast actually and dont forget the disease spreading whore only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face thats the point you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner and in every home literally and we tolerate it because its common it seems trivial and we tolerate all day long morning noon and night not anymore im setting the example and its going to be puzzled over and studied and followed from now on a woman innocent is that supposed to be funny look at the people i killed an obese man a disgusting man who could barely stand up who if you saw him on the street youd point so your friends could mock him along with you who if you saw him while you were eating you wouldnt be able to finish your meal after him i picked the lawyer and you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets you wouldnt because you know there are consequences its in those eyes of yours though nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work i wont deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner i only took their sins to logical conclusions i i doubt i enjoyed it any more than detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows isnt that true how happy would it make you to hurt me with impunity oh dont worry you wont i cant wait for you to see i cant wait its really going to be something its going to be flawless people will barely be able to comprehend it it will seem almost surreal but it will have a tangible reality so they wont be able to deny it you cant see the whole the whole complete act yet not yet but when this is done its going to be so so you know thats not true not me im not special im not exceptional this is though what im doing wanting people to pay attention you cant just tap them on the shoulder you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer then you have their strict attention youll seeim in how is it working for a scumbag like this you proud of yourself hes pissing in our faces again and were just taking it he wouldnt just turn himself in it doesnt make any sense what about the trace on his bank account and the guns there must be something to connect him with a past thank you theres nothing that says i have to work with him if somerset wants out goodbye give it to me give it to me somerset what the fuck is going on shut up what the fuck is going on here just keep leading the way sit back i seem to remember knocking on your door we would have gotten you eventually and why is that delusions of grandeur murderers like you murderers you only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off thats all now i wouldnt do something like that johnny i like you i like you a lot well ill be standing beside you the whole time so you be sure to let me know when this whole complete reality thing is done wouldnt want to miss it spit it out in two months no ones going to even remember this happened i hate to burst your bubble but other than the fact that youre especially sadistic theres nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours what makes you so special that people should pay attention were not just going to pick up two more bodies are we johnny that wouldnt be shocking enough wouldnt keep you on the front page of the newspapers where we headed put the gun down somerset put your gun down tell me its not true what did you say what are you talking about what happened wait kiss me on the lips well i have to tell you i think ive fallen in love with you i will no well what the fuck man you know hes fucking us when do we get to question him big surprise you knew id say yes you think youre doing me a big favor by staying oh you want to stay now he cut her up and dressed the wounds listen to yourself you say the problem with people is they dont care so i dont care about people but youre already here youve been here a long time so theres a part of you that knows even if everything you say is true none of it matters youre talking about people who are mentally ill youre oh youre so much better than everyone right no ones worthy of you what the fuck is wrong with you what burnt you out you think youre preparing me for the hard times ahead you think youre toughening me up well youre not youre quitting fine but im staying why dont you shut the fuck up for a while you bitch and complain if i thought like you i would have slit my wrist already you follow the law and do the best you can its all there you do your job youre the oldest man i know somerset how can you say that especially after today if we get him ill be happy enough sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps hes preaching looking around ive got a bad feeling these murders are his lifes work then he must write about these murders im trying alright just tell me what weve got we had him no point in arguing anymore okay okay get off by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead what the fuck is wrong with you we have probable cause now the hell i cant we get in there and we can stop him it was him im fine who told you about my silver tongue you been talking to my wife what are you going to say sure uh excuse me are you by any chance a serial killer oh you are well come with us then if its okay this is stupid itd be just too easy youre sure youre reading that right john doe the writings of saint thomas aqu aquin the marquis de sade and origins of sadism modern homicide investigation in cold blood of human bondage human bondage i know i know focusing on one little thing this is a waste of time how do you know all about this yeah some college student whos taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime so they ran our list how is this legal you got to be kidding what assessing fines him its be best if you got to the point cause im about ready to punch you in the face well that was money well spent i dont know like fifty what does all that matter anyway its not our job to figure him out is it all we have to do is catching him just because the bastard has a library card it doesnt make him einstein and so what we dont know for sure sooner or later his lucks goning to run out hey freud what brand of bullshit are you shoveling huh right now hes probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommys panties singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter oh blah blah blah the guys insane there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow i mean christ do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves im sick of sitting around waiting for him to kill again a landlords dream tenant a paralyzed man with no tongue sorry about that i just how do those cockroaches get here so quick i dont know about you but i feed off my emotions no kidding no fucking kidding i want him bad i dont just want to catch him anymore i want to hurt him it is victor sounds like he knew what he was talking about i expected it to be bad you know i took a human life but i slept like a baby that night i never gave it a second thought i got him i got the sonofabitch see i was doing really good up till then lots of street busts ive always had this weird luck everything always went my way but this was wild i got him with one shot right between the eyes next thing i know the mayors pinning a medal on me picture in the paper whole nine yards it was my first one of these we were a secondary unit and i was pretty shaky going in i was still considered a rookie never took a bullet i pulled my gun once fired it once satisfy our curiosity well tag along the fingerprints you tell me im new in town does this make it with you ive seen the same im not the country hick you seem to think i am bullshit oh thats all then you tell me what you think were doing and you dont who the hell knows theres plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they dont want to do you know little voices tell them bad things he just may be nuts enough just honestly have you ever seen anything like this been involved in anything like this oh yeah sure you got to be kidding what were screwed hes fucking with us what the fuck is that nothing even if they did those photos were taken before forensics okay but what i know none which i dont understand he had to get back out nothing like because someones holding a gun on you forced what right but there pride comes first not gluttony the sins are in a different order yeah parts of them anyway in purgatory dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain seeing all these other guys who sinned like in the parsons tale and dante punishing we put her in a safe house goulds wife she was away on business if this means she saw anything i dont know what weve questioned her at least five times look i appreciate being able to talk this out but uh he cut along the side of his stomach the love handle the leather chair was soaked through with sweat well his body was found monday night okay but get this the office was closed all day monday which means as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend our killer couldve gotten in here on friday he couldve spent all day saturday with gould and all day sunday our guy got into office probably before the building closed and security tightened up gould must have been working late youve never seen the odd couple this is sick the honeymooners i just have to say i cant respect any man whos never seen green acres you go to movies at least what about sports id like you to meet somerset hows that well its my wife detective mills here honey i asked you not to call me here ill call you back what why can we talk about this in private whoa whoa what this is his stuff ive been out in the cold all day this was one sadistic motherfucker it could be nothing this doesnt make any sense have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink near the food okay sure its just that with my old partner you know yeah well all i want is just just dont be jerking me off thats all i ask dont jerk me off the badge in my pocket says detective same as yours anyway i did my time on doortodoors and walking a beat i did all that shit for a long time youve seen my files right seen the things ive done you think it was poison i dont know feel free to look for yourself okay its a bucket of vomit theres a bucket under the table theres a bucket here when we found him he was lying there with a knife in his back so what else could it be but homicide except i finally figured out he held the knife behind him put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall then he shoved his body backwards then why are we wasting our time this guys hearts got to be roughly the size of a canned ham if this isnt a coronary i dont know what is who said this was murder for now and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who wasnt really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut i realize that i wasnt standing around guarding the local taco bell ive worked homicide for five and a half years maybe i thought i could do more good here than there i dont know look itd be great by me if we didnt start right off kicking each other in the balls but youre calling the shots lieutenant so however you want it to go maybe im not understanding the question im here for the same reasons as you i guess or at least the same reasons you used to have for being here before before you decided to quit i i dont follow i need to start getting the feel of it all right meet the people actually if its all the same id like to get to the precinct house asap seeing how we dont have much time for this whole transition thing im a little thrown i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here what are you absolutely certain anything anything missing or different please i need you to help

unconscious his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes it happened four blocks from here what are you talking about ill get a job maybe on a farm ill work on the house good im sure everyones doing their best its none of my business anymore already no i havent heard everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible also this shouldnt be his first assignment this cant be my last duty here it will go on and on one is gluttony envy sloth pride and lust seven there are seven deadly sins gluttony wrath greed dear detectives long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light its the murderers way of announcing himself who tied her down you or him where was the prostitute where was she where was the girl put it down put it on the ground who are you what are you doing out here turn around hands on your head no give me the gun david please why whats so exciting i mean at this point what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself i dont believe it

open and a ufo flies out i want you to have expected it i can tell you this i recognize his lawyer his names mark swarr hes only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece right can you even conceive of whats going to happen next i mean can you even imagine how hell try to finish it you and i are probably for the first time ever in total agreement he wouldnt just stop because he is john doe by choice as soon as this is over im gone no actually i wasnt sure at all im requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days youd be doing me the favor one of two things will happen were either going to get john doe or hell finish his series of seven and this case will go on for years call for help and youll live but youll be disfigured or put yourself out of your misery that part of me is dead no im not im talking about common everyday life here if you let yourself worry about one thing youll worry about the next and the next and it never ends in this place ignorance isnt just bliss its a matter of survival wrong i sympathize completely because if you cant win then if you dont ignore everything and everyone around you you you become like john doe its easier to beat a child than it is to raise it because it takes so much work to love you just have to make sure you dont stop to think about the abuse and the damage because youll risk being sad keep ignoring it wasnt one thing if thats what you mean i just i cant live here anymore i cant live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue people dont want a champion they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers just know that in this case theres not going to be any satisfaction if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself if it turned out he were actually satan then that might live up to our expectations no human being could do these things right but this is not the devil its just a man wheres the victory you tell me then you walk into an apartment and a man has beaten his wife to death or the wife murdered the husband and you have to wash the blood off their children you put the killer in jail who won dont try to focus on things as black and white because youll go blind theres no winning and losing here no face it now stop thinking its good guys against bad guys you know theres not going to be a happy ending to this its not possible anymore one birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book the century of the detective by jurgen thorwald it traced the history of deduction as a science and it sealed my fate because it was real not fiction and that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime it was incredible to me the irony is after a day of the type of work he did hed come home and read me these morbid crime stories murders in the rue morgue le fanus green tea my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours these murders are his masterwork his sermon to all of us to all us sinners no dates indicated placed on the shelves in no discernible order its just his mind poured out on paper i dont think its going to give us any specifics what sick ridiculous puppets we are and what a gross little stage we dance on what fun we have dancing and fucking not a care in the world not knowing that we are nothing we are not what was intended well there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room and near as i can tell each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages we could use about fifty more men here what are you talking about you stupid son of a think it through if we leave a hole like this well never prosecute hell walk we have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door think about how we got here think about it we need a warrant you cant go in there wait just wait what happened are you alright you do the talking put that old silver tongue of yours to work well take a look at him talk to him thats what it says jonathan doe saint thomas aquinas he wrote about the seven deadly sins that is its not what you think it is the divine comedy a history of catholicism a book called murderers and madmen were focusing i dont neither do you yeah well at least were out of the office weve got pizza if you want to know whos been reading paradise lost purgatory and say the life and time of charlie manson the bureaus computer will tell you it might give us a name legal illegal these terms dont apply i dont applaud it flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable communism to violent crime they monitor reading habits not every book but certain ones are flagged books about lets say how to build a nuclear bomb or maybe mein kampf whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the fbi from then on for a long time the fbis been hooked into the library system keeping accurate records its probably nothing but even if it is its no skin off our teeth the man at hot dog world is a friend in the bureau by telling you this im trusting you more than i trust most people lets go how much money do you have just realize this is not some common lunatic the type of intestinal fortitude it must take to keep a man bound for a full year to connect tubes to his genitals to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints hes methodical and exacting and worst of all hes patient well hes been right so far hasnt he this quote his first words to us i looked it up its from miltons paradise lost long is the way and hard that out of hell leads up to light yes we do here no hes not depending on luck youve seen that we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed to the day to the day because he wanted us to no its a fine line between insane and inspired its too dismissive to call him a lunatic we cant make that mistake this is the job its not an easter egg hunt who pays the rent on time victors landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month he says quote i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment threeoone and nobody ever complained about him hes the best tenant ive ever had oh its alright they pay cops for the inside scoop and they pay well hell string us along all the way if were not careful we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here no matter how hard it is we have to stay focused on the details listen to me hes all about playing games the way this has gone till now i wouldnt have thought it was possible but we may have underestimated this guy call an ambulance i think hemingway wrote somewhere i cant remember where but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this you have to have the ability to kill i think he meant you truly must be able to do it not just faking it too survive how was it how did the fire fight end and never in my twentyfour years knock on wood ive only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it never fired it though not once you why would we yes they were there so it must be he doesnt have the desire somehow our killer seems to have more purpose more purpose than victor could ever conceive of doesnt seem like our man does it in this city if all the skeletons came out of all the closets if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again thered be no more room for the living im sorry but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues ive seen so many corpses rolled away unrevenged we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away on the slim chance its ever needed in a courtroom its like collecting diamonds on a desert island you keep them just in case you ever get rescued but its a pretty big ocean out there all we do is pick up the pieces we take all the evidence and all the pictures and samples we write everything down and note what time things happened i wish i still thought like you you meant what you said to mrs gould didnt you about catching this guy you really want to believe that dont you it doesnt fit he doesnt want us to help him stop no just wait bear with me there must be something a switchblade its got to be youre sure your men didnt move this what if its not that shes seen something what if shes supposed to see something but she just hasnt been given a chance to see it yet this is the one thing no witnesses of any kind totally unrelated victims no fingerprints attrition when you regret your sins but not because you love god for now lets just consider the books as the murderers inspiration the books and sermons are about atonement for sin and these murders have been like forced attrition seven terraces of purgation did you read them the sins were used in medieval sermons there were seven cardinal virtues and then seven deadly sins created as a learning tool because they distract from true worship hes preaching and if its a threat this is just to satisfy my curiosity im still leaving town saturday he must have left another puzzle piece all day saturday and all day sunday the murderer would want gould to take his time to have to sit there and decide where do you make the first cut theres a gun in your face but what part of your body is expendable im certain he was the biggest defense lawyer around infamous actually i vaguely recall a large angry man and someone called norton i read remember reading what about them all television does is teach children that its really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day hello tonight im invited to have a late supper at your house and i accept what its a package deal you get the phone with the office its too soon for him im declining this case i want us reassigned this is a premeditated puzzle and its only the beginning he ate his fill and was forced to continue eating till his body rejected the food the killer held a bucket under him and then kept serving he took his time the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours the victims throat was swollen from the effort and there was probably a point where he passed out thats when killer kicked him in the stomach popped him but why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing it must have been intentional you always have to find one singular thing to focus on theres always one thing and it may be as small as a speck of dust but you find it and focus till its an exhausted possibility same color and texture i just dont think we should have that sort of relationship wed start quarreling over insignificant things is that clear i made a decision because i have to consider the integrity of the scene i cant worry whether you think youre getting enough time on the playing field good no guessing at this point is useless is there any blood in it what please be quiet for a while would you no one yet drop it i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into well over the next seven days do me the favor of remembering it not here let me tell you how i want this to go i want you to look and i want you to listen its very simple you worked a nice quiet town but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it ive just never seen it done that way before detective you just met me all this effort youve made to get transferred its the first question that pops into my head i meant to ask you something mills when we spoke on the phone i cant help wondering why here since were just starting out i thought we could go to a bar sit and talk for awhile after that well i can tell you now i know im positive i made the right decision im positive but theres never a day that passes that i dont wish i had decided differently well i got up one morning and went to work just like any other day except it was my first since hearing about the baby and i i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me i looked around and i thought how can we raise a child surrounded by all this how can a child grow up here so that night i told her i didnt want us to have it and over the next few weeks i convinced her it was wrong i mean i wore her down slowly oh tracy i have to tell you im not the one to talk to about this you should look into private schools he mentioned it talk to him about it hell understand if you tell him how you feel you have to put blinders on sometimes most times i feel strange being here with you without david knowing its a hard place i dont know with this case too long what do you think so far any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me disagreeable just ask your husband i was close once it just didnt happen i guess i wont be showing it to him then dont worry i dont wear it at the dinner table really i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts it smells good oh um william did their son see it happen yes look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here why always like this only after the fact this sudden realization that if you shoot someone or stick a knife in them that person will cease to exist did the wife confessand when vger melds what will happen to you it expects a return signal now ordering it to transmit that information to the creator vger is announcing that it has arrived sir that its ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect to join and become one with the creator a machine then it had to be programmed by whom you said vgers purpose was to find and join with the creator does vger object to the presence of the two carbon units within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit if i can help you revive these patterns you could understand our functions better what does that mean enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units what is enterprises proper evolvement yes the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units in what way is the life form in your vessel different and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this point here captain it should pick up even a tricorder playback the fault is here sir not in the transmission the antenna leads have been disconnected vger never intended to accept a transmitted signal captain id like to go along captain we cant be sure that our move will actually save earth im afraid our hand is pretty weak captain but its the only game in town captain whats the next move why bring us inside not to destroy us they could have done that outside the ship is under attack man all defensive stations its taken control of the computer you asked my opinion sir thats precisely the point captain we dont know it will do moving into the cloud at this time is an unwarranted gamble i advise caution captain we cant withstand another attack captain weve seen what their weapons can do shouldnt we take every possible precaution recommend defensive posture captain screens and shields of course not im aware of mister spocks qualifications yes sir ill do that sir you havent logged a single star hour in two and a half years that plus your unfamiliarity with the ships design in my opinion sir seriously jeopardizes our mission permission to speak freely sir im aware of that sir thank you sir im sorry i embar rassed you sir the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines when they went into antimatter imbalance the phasers were automatically cut off but i still recommend further simulation study program set for standard warp entry captain none available captain theres no one in fact whos fully rated on this design no admiral i dont think you are not one damned bit i remember when you recommended me for this command you told me how envious you were and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again well sir it looks like you found a way admiral this is an almost totally new enterprise you dont know her a tenth as well as i do may i ask why you personally are assuming command you are what you got the enterprise its what you wanted this is what i want but jim im the right choice for this mission we have twentyone minutes captain we can still save vger and ourselves mr spock what would vger need to fulfill itself forward motion captain it seems we all imagine god in our own image that probe in there in a different form now is the same thing that killed ilia its a programmed mechanism mr spock we could have cut it off at the main computer they may have attacked only as a warning to us captain to keep away if id seen you again would you have been able to say it no more than i expected not as difficult as this im sorry wormhole distortion has over loaded main power systems negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sublight speed i now the captain meant no person al insult hello iliawe will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready our data is being prepared then vger must withdraw its orbiting devices the information will not be disclosed because vger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet not until vger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet the carbonunits are not responsible for that why why the examination is a normal function who is vger find the creator what creator whose what does vger want of the creator why does vger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead where is lt ilia is vger the captain of the alien vessel who isvger mr scott on my next signal engineering mr chekov when do those devices activate spock get a fix on his position have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator very well mr chekov see to it viewer off departure angle on viewer enterprise i want that signal again transmit capture god in order to retrieve vgers data the creator has to physically come here mr decker i will contact you every five minutes otherwise inform mr scott immediately no if we do not provide vger with certain information we wont have twentytwo seconds the plan must be implemented upon arrival well mr decker it seems my bluff is being called the question is mr decker is there a next move they could have many ways of destroying things mr decker forcefields full remaining strength total reserve its running our records starfleet strength earth defenses computer off how do you define unwarranted mister that thing is twenty hours from earth we know nothing about it yet mr decker no that could also be misinter preted as hostile mr decker cloud composition mr spock mister chekov log mister spocks starfleet commission reactivated list him as science officer both effective immediately if our executive officer has no objections i trust you will nursemaid me through these difficulties mister granted stop competing with me decker you saved the ship then you acted properly of course explanation mr decker why was my phaser order countermanded mister decker every minute brings that object nearer earth engineering stand by for warp drive programming ready you are mister decker im afraid youll have to double as science officer well have to replace commander sonak id still like a vulcan there if possible thats why youre staying aboard im sorry will my experience five years out there dealing with unknowns like this my familiarity with the enterprise this crew yes youll stay aboard as executive officer a temporary grade reduction to commander im replacing you as captain of the enterprise im taking over the center seat im sorry will viewer standard ahead opinion mister spock transmit mr spock now mr spock i stand corrected mr decker navigator lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center bring us parallel to whatever we find in there mr chekov stand by on the phasers time to impact and in you too lieutenant our exec and science officer welcome aboard lieutenant that was the order mr sulu clear the bridge hold station maneuvering thrusters mr sulu ahead one third full sensor scan mr spock they cant expect us not to look them over now viewer ahead hold relative position here adjust parallel course navigator bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance reduce magnification factor 4 mr sulu mr sulu steady as she goes ahead warp one mr sulu hold station maneuvering thrusters mister sulu i appreciate the welcome i wish the circumstances were less critical epsilon nine is monitoring the intruder keep a channel open to them where is captain decker starfleet boost your matter gain we need more signal two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale mr scott but i wouldnt exactly consider myself untried mr scott theres an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet see that it is take me over please why arent the enterprise transporters in operation mister scott and the foolish emotions which drive us spock we were its answer theres no way to know vger expected it to be a machine some single entity all of us here may be reduced into patterns vger plans to literally meld to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns the point there is no alternative not for us the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point then child high mag mr sulu what answers what should you have known were you right spock vger is a living machine if this is their ships data banks where is the crew or is their entire ship automated klingons our epsilon 9 station and ilia they seem to be more than just images and these sensorswarms collect that data carry it here answers to what spock our dilemma or your personal one bridge cancel rescue teams spock what in the hell are you doing out here spock concerned about his chances ilias memory her feelings of loyalty friendship obedience might all be there they had a pattern to follow have you been able to analyze any of this delay that order scotty disengage all main drive systems get someone up here to take the navigators station engineering full emergency power transmit image of the alien to starfleet advise we are attempting further communication no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude mr decker but they understood our messages they broke off the attack our insignificance any reply from them communicated with us how mr decker i will not provoke an attack if that order isnt clear to you do not return scan mr spock it may be misinterpreted as hostility i know this has been painful spock for me too thank you let it drop bones you are my science officer ill expect an immediate report on anything further you learn or sense from here on and whatever you sensed out here also there was nothing in your report about why youre here youve reported that you felt strong thought emotions a group of minds from a space vessel could you make out any plan anything to do with earth i want him here sit down sit down please i intend to be there following that meeting report to me one hour twelve im on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes report to me on the enterprise in one hour here at starfleet the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock why arent you on board youve received your appointment as enterprise science officer thank you scotty stand by engineering status mr scott that object out there is less than two days from earth mister scott weve got to intercept while it still is out there warp drive as soon as possible mr scott engineer we need warp speed nowjim he wants it that transmitter is a vital link between vger and the creator vger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension vger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator a tractor beam then vger believes the creator to be a machine too exactly and you did have a relationship with lieutenant ilia commander we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in precise detail suppose that beneath its programming the real ilias memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision captain this probe may be a key a key to the aliens this served the purpose that would presuppose a feeling commander compassion i sensed no emotion only pure logic i prefer your poet dantes phrase the divine restlessness of the human spirit yes captain it needed our mortality the fear of it our struggle against it our fears our dreams that seems to be what it has planned to have the creator physically present here and then to reassemble itself combined with the creator the most certain way of obtaining all the creators answers the point is captain twentytwo captain the orbital device will not be triggered for twentytwo minutes has not doctor and now because of what we are planning will not no captain not for us for vger precisely yes captain a child evolving into adulthood learning searching instinctively needing these read as identical composition however captain they measure several hundred times more powerful is this all i am is there not more no meaning no hope and jim no answers jim its looking for answers itself a life form of its own a conscious living entity captain i do not believe there is a crew or that this is a vessel as such exact patterns the energy bolt that hit them wasnt simply a weapon it dematerialized them stored them but why new crystals they must contain the most recent data obtained it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information a remarkably efficient system i am seeking answers captain i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information they may have followed it too precisely i believe the light flares to be energy fields undoubtedly part of the vessels inner mechanism a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i can not we can not break free captain we do not have a fraction of the power necessary captain we have been seized by a tractor beam that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earths sun instruments fluctuating captain patterns unrecognizable recommend we proceede captain we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality yet they can not understand who we are or what we want the puzzlement i sensed was fleeting minor as if carrying a sense of our insignificance captain it appears that our message has been understood captain they have they have been communicating with us i sense puzzlement why have we not replied captain i suspect theres an object at the heart of that cloud intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center energy of a type entirely un known to me i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer sir is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not i still contain fragments of my human half that inquiry invades my personal life captain negative captain i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic i can explain nothing more i understand nothing more sir i would appreciate dr mccoy absenting himself from this interview reporting as ordered captainwhy don t the zulus attack you afeared of the zulus then quartermaster will we be fighting the zulus soo quartermaster from the cook sir they saw me dip your shaving tin in the teawater this morning made their tea taste of lifebuoy toilet soap they saij handing him the bottle of gin he purloined earlier 2t will you hear last post sir
