thats your problem suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics all in siwash cave in a postcatastrophe world your offspring would of necessity intermarry forming in time a tribe a tribe every member of which had giant thumbs a tribe of big thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways it could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools it would have to rely on its wits and its senses it would have to live with animals and plants as virtual equals its extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants learning their languages perhaps and paying them the respect they deserve the world isnt going to end you dummy i hope you know that much but it is going to change its going to change drastically and probably in your lifetime the clock people see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change and they may be right since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue but there are far worse catastrophes coming unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization in other words unless it can break the consumption habit and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption it isnt merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes but that our operative politicaleconomic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault so the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan all right but therell be some of us itll miss little pockets of humanity like the clock people like you two honeys if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on siwash cave theres almost no worldwide calamity famine nuclear accident plague weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield that you couldnt survive in that cave easy come easy go you mean shes dead i want to go back to the clock people i kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what theyre up to whats happened to jelly yes everything is getting worse but everything is also getting better ha ha ho ho and hee hee the clock people mistook me for chinese and the name stuck in the same way that all indian tribes came to be labeled indians through the ignorance of an italian sailor with a taste for oranges it is only fitting that indians misnamed me the clock people however are not a tribe rather they are a gathering of indians from various tribes they have lived together since 1906 during the second world war i busted out of tule lake detention camp as a japaneseamerican i had been put there and watched over i found refuge with the clock people who discovered me in a snow bank near dead i had been climbing across the sierra nevada mountains but unlike the clockworks of the clock people my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe ha ha ho ho and hee hee he was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this faraway siwash ridge i came to the dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own the clockworks is one reason that i am here on siwash ridge i accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the clock people clockworks neither do i ha ha ho ho hee hee save your breath for the climb i know who you areaw hes some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out west gives my ranch the creeps and the willies too but though he be old and dirty hes alive ill bet clear down to his toes they dont have his juice in a jar in new haven well i suppose that ill have to write sissy out on the road chinks the guys name for christs sake what do they do to you boys in those ivy league schools anyway strap you down and pump the nature out of you they can even press the last drop of nature out of a mohawk buck why send a shaman or cannibal to yale for four years and all hed be fit for would be a desk in the militaryindustrial complex and a seat in the third row at a neil simon comedy jesus hms christ if harvard or princeton could get hold of the chink for a couple of semesters theyd turn him into a candidate for the bow tie wing of the hall of wimps oogie boogie whose fault was that shit o dear julian do you mean to tell me you didnt get it on what do you think like what she always leaves town you dummy that doesnt mean anything what about in bed how does she like it in bed ninety degrees to the left i hope how does she feel about you its high time you realized honey babe that a woman doesnt have to give the best years of her life to radcliffe or smith in order to speak the english language shes obviously that jesus which would you rather have a million dollars or one of sissys thumbs full of pennies sissy youre trying to protect those scuzzy bitches well let your conscience be your guide as my mommy used to say but it wont work those stinking sluts are going to suffer sissy dont play dumb with me youre a good model but a shitty actress the cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance you know perfectly well they are last seen in nebraska didnt make it to canada siwash lake is between nebraska and canada the cowgirls have possession of siwash lake and who else but jellybeans wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds how much do you know about it have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows good good good youll enjoy it youll see julian is a gentleman i cant be certain that you would but what have you got to lose yes well what im getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity she cant wait too long you know now theres no reason why you must lose yours i mean just ponder it a bit thats all but here you are still a virgin you are virginal yet arent you now now dont get exasperated i realize that youve always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men and i might add youve been wise heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage for men marriage is a matter of efficient logistics the male gets his food bed laundry tv pussy offspring and creature comforts all under one roof where he doesnt have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life which is what existence is all about but for a woman marriage is surrender purely personal i believe you might enjoy one another shit o dear thats enough to make me asthmatic the nerve of those twits what do they know about female odor dont interrupt heres my concept my ranch out west its a beauty ranch oh its got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes but its a beauty ranch a place where unhappy women divorcees and widows mainly can go to lose weight remove wrinkles change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment my ranch is named the rubber rose after the rubber rose douche bag my own invention and bless its little red bladder the most popular douche bag in the world so get this its on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes the last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence well these cranes stop off at my little pond siwash lake its called twice a year autumn and spring and spend a few days each time resting up eating doing whatever whooping cranes do ive never seen them understand but i hear theyre magnificent very big specimens i mean huge mothers and white as snow to coin a phrase except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers and bright red heads now whooping cranes in case you didnt know it are noted for their mating dance its just the wildest show in nature its probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons picture these rare beautiful gigantic birds in full dance leaping six feet off the mud arching their backs flapping their wings strutting low to the ground dears its overwhelming and picture the birds doing their sex dance on tv right there on the home screen creations most elaborate sex ritual yet clean and pure enough to suit the pope with lovely sissy hankshaw in the foreground in a white gown red hood attached and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black in a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane she dancewalks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of yoni yum and a can of dew offcamera a string quartet is playing debussy a sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love are you starting to get it doesnt it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud my very goodness gracious grandiose lyrical erotic and girl scout oriented you cant top it ive hired a crew of experts from walt disney studios the best wildlife cinematographers around youre my eternal favorite princess grace herself couldnt be better not even if she had your personality which she doesnt anyway dear im out of photography now and into water colors ah how circuitous conversation is were back at the beginning the exact man ive wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist i am once more about to make advertising history and only you the original yoni yumdew girl could possibly assist me sissy sissy blushing bride you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways the countess has arranged a job for you and what a job oh my dear yes i bought a little ranch out west sort of a tribute to the women of america who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products dew spray mist and yoni yum spray powder a tax writeoff actually shes a young thing who works on my ranch real name is sally jones or something wooden like that shes cute as a hot fudge taco and of course it takes verve to change ones name so charmingly but she stinks like a slut just the same what oh yes teehee jellybean you were the yoni yum girl from lets see from nineteen sixtyeight through nineteen seventy youve always smelled so nice like a little sister the irony has just killed me you the dew girl one of the few girls who doesnt need dew i loath the stink of females they are so sweet the way god made them then they start fooling around with men and soon theyre stinking like rotten mushrooms like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool like a tuna fishs retirement party they all stink from the queen of england to bonanza jellybean they stink shit o goodness you wont be thirty for another year and youre more beautiful

mister d you think the das gon na file on joanne she kills the old man and makes it look like miss lawson did it pretty slick what good does that do its the old will what would joanne braslow need with an estate attorney she wasnt even mentioned in marshs will joanne braslow is getting more and more interesting i followed her today to an attorneys office joseph koehler right now guess whos been buying coke from him for the last five and half years im sorry to barge in but i figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news because it hasnt all been erased its very good because when the das office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape otherwise they would have buried it i would have missed it but the phone rang and i let it play while i talked it looks like blank tape but it isnt its been erased without any input signal coming in no but i got something ive been waiting for you to get back im trying before you ask theres nothing new on the coke so where do we start im sorry man but i aint ever heard of no brother dying from gettin too much pussy yeah i hear they had em a real dog and pony show going on up there ill tell you sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me i mean did this old guy really think he was gon na be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that how you doin mister dyou did a good job charlie i dont know take some time off under the law a person can not profit from their own wrong doing since rebecca lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will if she is found guilty the will is void and joanne braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated here it is according to the old will joanne braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars joe koehler i know him hes an estate attorney and hes very expensive charlie are you going to make a point soon you got something on the coke why so what good is it to us if its been erased you got something on the coke youve got to get me something i can use charlie i want you to hit all the dealers in town give them a list of people close to marsh and see if any of them use then i want you to check out a doctor alan paley he lives up in roseburg we have to find out who else would profit from marshs death and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal it couldve happened to anyone fine charlie you familiar with the marsh case can i go your honor im trying to establish a pattern in dr paleys behavior with women your honor im trying to establish the sense of betrayal miss lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was ill rephrase the question mr roston isnt it true you are bisexual the opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view objection the question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness your honor i dont see a mr roston listed as a prosecution witness youve been following me you dont know what youre talking about thats ridiculous back off john i didnt hear it ive got work to do im just curious to see if mr troxell reconstructed anything else i was just about to make my point your honor your honor this is a tape from miss lawsons answering machine i would like to play it now yeah well well let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that shes innocent ill tell her but she wont take it i dont buy it and neither will a jury suspicions maybe but suspicions arent enough for a conviction why would she want that cmon think about it if she was going to kill marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find youre bluffing john its me remember ive known you since your name was juan carlos can you you cant show intent lookin to make the papers john no miss lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions she doesnt have to sit here and be insulted so either you charge her now or were leaving thats it my client doesnt have to take this crap from you i mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to im sure she didnt enjoy it im sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked dont you see what shes doing she needs you to kill me shes planned it that way from the start thats why she phoned me tonight thats all dr paley no further questions i suggest it never happened youre still angry arent you isnt it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at miss lawson youll be sorry and after that didnt you continuously harass miss lawson and the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not if necessary i can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence you didnt grab her and try to kiss her isnt it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on miss lawson in the parking lot dr paley where were you the last time you saw miss lawson then you have no way of knowing what mr marsh told miss lawson were the reasons for his visits did miss lawson ever accompany mr marsh inside during his examinations did mr marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to miss lawson about his illness dr trammel did you ever speak to miss lawson about mr marshs condition one last question doctor if someone didnt know better would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine a previous witness stated that she saw miss lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on october twentyeighth according to your records when did you prescribe the drug how do you instruct your patients to take it would you describe for the court what chinese peony root looks like what did you prescribe for her did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps why does she come to you and is miss lawson a patient of yours dr wong what type of medicine do you practice what else did the district attorneys office tell you to say then those are not your own words high school did you go to college mrs crawford what happened what happened next do you remember his exact words what did he say how did he make your life miserable and what did dr paley do after you stopped seeing him then what happened what was the nature of your relationship with dr paley where did you meet him miss sellers do you know dr alan paley then why did you go see mr koehler in the first place you didnt know about it before that whyd you come here what do you have in your purse you killed him didnt you joanne then you would have gotten your money because you were jealous because he cut you out of the will because you have a cocaine habit to feed because you know that if rebecca lawson is found guilty the new will is void and theres a very good chance the old one would be honored isnt it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle isnt it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought you see thats what bothers me no other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house the police looked there was only the one bottle but you say you didnt arrive until after mr marsh was dead yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death how do you think it got there am or pm would you read for us the time of the purchase theres an item you picked up thats marked will you read it well im a little confused this is a charge receipt from rosens drug store where mr marsh had an account its dated the day of the murder is this your signature two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money that must have made you pretty angry in his previous will mr marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars then he cut you out why do you think he did that and that he changed his will and that mr marsh paid less attention to you and you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you you resented the fact that she told you what to do in mr marshs house you dont like her because you were involved with mr marsh before she came along isnt that true you dont like miss lawson much do you youve tried it isnt it true that youve been in and out of rehab centers for the last four years money isnt the only reason people commit murder miss braslow it must have been horrible having to go there seeing them together knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you youre lying marsh was wearing a cast on the tape it was right before he went to chicago and met miss lawson he dumped you for her didnt he i thought he was a kind gentle man he video taped you well think about it isnt it possible so isnt it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didnt stop it was going to kill him that if she did leave his heart couldnt take it so the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving that must cause tremendous anxiety sleepless nights incredible stress didnt mr marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to chicago for awhile could you repeat the last part of what mr marsh said to you the day before his death do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom how do you know that what about miss lawson did mr marsh use drugs how do you know what kind of sex they had if you dont know her that well what makes you think shes capable of murder i take it you dont like miss lawson very much you dont really believe what the district attorney is saying about miss lawson do you what changed im not asking for names or specifics i just want to know what prompted you to make the call i need to ask you a question what made you get in touch with joanne braslow hi joe no further questions would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her and she left shortly after that and didnt miss lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover and your sexual tastes were something that you hid from miss lawson hows it supposed to work rebecca you and paley celebrate your victory you get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you but then hes given himself away as your accomplice now he has to kill me after that i figure shell tell the police that you broke in that you were crazed because we humiliated you in court shes right paley youve got to kill me she doesnt have to shes free she cant be tried again but you you planned it with her you supplied the coke youre an accessory to murder im not leaving without that tape that wasnt the deal you killed him you killed him and i got you off hello youre a monster im dropping the case you dont need anybody you killed him didnt you he was only doing what he thought was right rebecca we shattered a mans life in open court whats that for what are you going you doing rebecca take these off honey what does that mean youve been thinking about the case or you thought everything out before you killed marsh im glad you have such confidence in me paley could be a problem tomorrow can i see you later its only the beginning alone i called you all weekend where were you why would she lie no i dont have to believe you the jury has to believe you and answers like hes lying or shes mistaken arent going to convince them thats not good enough goddamit i just left joanne braslow she told me she saw you doing cocaine at marshs house you lied to me you take a lot for granted is that what you think i was thinking what would i broke my ankle skating that ended that dream yeah no i wanted to be a professional hockey player its going to be hard to convince a jury that hes testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off tell me about doctor paley its okay yeah great ill see you at the office at nine i just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow hi its frank nothing its not my taste oh well theyre different i think the photographers probably a voyeur no it just doesnt look right because im your attorney i shouldnt be going to your house this is your house sure where to why didnt you live together and then howd you meet marsh if you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard try why not how as it pertains to you not me did you always know you had different tastes i think were getting a little off the subject here were not animals no pain no gain those same men will be sitting on the jury this is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex i want you to know right now that the trials going to be nasty your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud theyre going to say that you enticed marsh led him down a dark path ill have you out in a few hours you still havent answered my question youre assuming the district attorney is going to file charges not a very good one im afraid i dont know thats why im asking you there are no charges against you im here to decide if im going to represent you should that occur did you kill him alright ill talk to her raymond im the only criminal attorney you have why im supposed to be on vacation andrew marsh was a very wealthy man a trial like this is going to put cardenas in the spotlight i know what day it is get off the phone because im expecting a call michael get off the phone i love you well thats kind of how i am right now you know how it is sometimes when youre out playing ball with your friends how youre really concentrating on what youre doing and you lose track of time and you come home late and mom yells at you hey you know better than that what did i teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something what are they saying i can back it up your honor the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons mr marsh died how it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance how often do you use cocaine mr roston objection the witness has already stated that miss lawson left without an explanation but your honor no your honor discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities who told you to say that is this what you want huh is it you think thats the answer sex is that what you want you want me to make love to you its more involved than that i dont know please not now you wouldnt like what youd see you dont know me anymore i dont know me anymore i know i was thinking that when the trial is over wed all go skiing for a weekend no im not because i knew youd think exactly what youre thinking yes working charlie and i were going over some statements sharon its late can we get to the point whats wrong yeah what are you doing up yeah fine excuse me ill be right back because i go to trial in seven weeks ive got a lot of preparing to do ill talk to him later i can think of worse ways to go humped yeah but can she cook attractive bright distant charming when she wants to be i dont know yet i want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow he must have something or he wouldnt be pressing so hard some example you set i know what can i do he is the boss hello hi raymond what well i was sort of planning on alright okay goodbye that was sattler he thinks the das going to file on rebecca lawson he wants me in the office tomorrow morning cant it wait im always open to learning new things and i suppose youre going to show me how to relax really i am relaxingit would be the same as shooting a gun at him it would be an added stress to his heart increase his heart rate yes those of mr marsh and a thumb print of miss lawsons yes we found a bottle of dristan nasal spray on the nightstand it was filled with water and cocaine mr marsh had a head cold at the time of his death i believe he wasnt aware that he was ingesting cocaine i dont think so the membrane in his nasal passage didnt show any sign of long time usage we found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood no very poor he was suffering from severe arterial disease a massive cardiac arrest cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want we know marsh had a head cold we found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand the coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant but for a much shorter time hed keep using more and more never knowing what he was taking yes thats what my report will read the official cause of death was a cardiac arrest marsh wasnt alone we found traces of sperm on the sheets the toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood not sure ill have everything you need tomorrow about three hoursshe was yes i woke up the next morning and she was gone i couldnt help myself you get lost inside a women like her it was like a drug it was the best sex i ever had she started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me she reached down and put me inside her my doctor had warned me about exerting myself but you really dont think of those things at a moment like that you just think about how beautiful this woman is how much you want her how deeply you want to please her at first it started off slowly but the rhythm built and built every time i got close to an orgasm she would stop eventually i started to have trouble breathing rebecca just kept going faster and faster no matter what i said she wouldnt stop i really thought for a moment i was going to die she said she was going to fuck me like ive never been fucked before she told me that tonight we were going to open new doors i asked her to stop to take off the handcuffs but she wouldnt listen shes a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality sometimes i felt she could read my mind it was uncanny how she knew exactly what i wanted a few nights before my heart surgery rebecca woke me she had handcuffed me to the bed its hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is it was like sex was a game to her she got off on the control she always used to tell me it had to be her way it was like she was trying to push me as far as she could she called it opening new doors well i think that after the operation she realized that she didnt she just left she left me it didnt fine the doctors say if i keep taking care of myself i can live to be a very old man i had bypass surgery i had a bad heart it was wild she was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up kinky things i tried to satisfy her

something with joan dave im workingjesus uhoh sort of yeah just what you think i mean then well all go to jail together dont do this bob he was only doing his job i heard you you said cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget and you can keep your homeless shelter hes only doing what you told him to bob you cant kill a president what are you gon na do i dont think so hundredth cabinet meeting i thought it was a nice touch dave these things get awfully complicated sometimes im telling you bob its a gift when you got a ferrari you dont leave it in the garage how long have you been waiting to pass that thing and look at this russell came around on the trade bill couple of days anyhow look at these tracking polls theyll burn up in your hands seventy three percent with seniors eighty four with working mothers remember that first liberty stuff we almost got nailed on its gon na be great caring about his wife spending time on her favorite issue its a homeless shelter uh let me get back to you okay lets see you can have him on tuesday the 25th you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months weve got nothing bob this wont work clean clean the guys a boy scout bob he declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return i mean ive checked everything women liquor finances i went all the way back to his high school race for student body president clean everybody else is buying the minor stroke story i told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at the hotel she seems to hate him more than ever her oh the first lady she was giving that commencement speech up in bryn mawr i managed to catch her before she left the hotel duanes guys but hes got them under control i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred the older one wanted head of the cdc oh i know and then when our poor president gets another stroke of course much more serious this time the newly appointed vp becomes the pres you mean we get dave to nominate you as vice president do you know how many different kinds of laws weve broken yes exactly a condition up and around soon mild stroke like how bob the guy had a stroke till what bob the guys in a coma bob what look at some point were going to have to call the vice president shes a little hysterical right now weve got her upstairs in a laundry room i know they say it hit both sides of his brain even if he makes it hes gon na be a vegetable hes not dave absolutely well that might be kind of tough once the press starts smelling blood oh i know i know it looks awfully bad its really embarrassing but it was bobs idea wrong we had to dave the guys a choir boy right we can pick up on the rest tomorrow dave the budgets a very complicated thing even i dont understand it sometimes now occasionally we have to make some cuts and president vetoes works bill what fine she hardly ever sees him and itll be so fast she wont have a chance to tell its just five minutes she comes in you wave to the press she leaves dave dave thanks i wrote it what right now whenever he stands at a podium the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat i dont think so what now some of this may feel a bit strange at first you got ta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to in the car now lets say the whole country was in that car the entire united states of america well lets say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital youd do it then for sure wouldnt you you know on an empty road where you know its safe and nobodys around im afraid so oh yeah probably its actually kind of serious dave im afraid the presidents not in very good shape well its its sort of an an incident really i know i know its difficult for all of us but sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gqod of the country extend them cmere for a second in fact we think you did such a good job wed like to extend things a little bit were not upset with you dave we think you did a terrific job dont we now dave something has come up and i think we need to talk about it you sure a coke or a perrier or something all set father mclntire he blessed you at the inauguration itll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech were all set sir were doing our best sir were working on it uh yes sir the

raptors right youre sure the third ones contained are you sure and swallows fresh ones what happens is that after a while the stones get smooth every six weeks so the animal regurgitates them a gizzard like birds totally incidental unrelated to the feeding pattern elm thats it it explains the periodicity the not just every six weeks ellie ive been thinking theres something about the periodicity doesnt had up oh ellie its so beautiful its the most beautiful thing i ever saw dilophosaurus wait a minute how do you interrupt the cellular mitosis were out of a job how did you do it how did you do this ellie theyre absolutely theyre moving in herds they do move in herds say again ellie we can tear up the rule book on coldbloodedness it doesnt apply theyre totally wrong this is a warmblooded creature theyre totally wrong the movement what kind of park is it and what are those uh this is our paleobotanist dr ellie yeah plenty some of them cant walk the cretaceous they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous they do smell some of them smell babies smell they smell oh ellie look theyre noisy theyre messy theyre sticky theyre expensive yeah i know you knowkids you want to have one of those yes good shape too five six feet high im guessing nine feet long look at the thats good thats right they died around a driedup puddle without

scared about its just a little hiccup in the power well i didnt ask why wouldnt they be their radios out too gennaro said to stay put no yeah they hate me i mustve touched something this happens all the time it must be my fault machines hate me whatd i touch why youre married you got any kids you have no idea cloning from what loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand try to mr hammond ive decided not to endorse your park what does he mean by target audience who do they show intelligence with the brain cavity like theirs we assumed alan grant tell me what kind of metabolism do they have whats their growth rate rate of growth blood temperature feels like high eighties lets get outta here cant you stop these things and youre going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirtyfoot neck without a fourchambered heart and get around like that like that this is like a knockout punch for warmbloodedness that things got a what twentyfive twentyseven foot neck this would be an awfully unusual time no im sorry that wouldnt be possible weve just discovered a new skeleton and what kind of opinions i uh dont really know any we and who in gods name do you

well on the tour the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps they mutated the dinosaurs genetic code and blended it with that of frogs now some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female in a single sex environment malcolm was right look life found a way youre a beautiful big animal its okay its okay its a brachiosaur all night ill stay awake i guess well just have to evolve too theyre just doing what they do well the other kind just do what they do tim tim tim no i didnt hear anything no were okay go thats the way were going to go what do you say its safe im trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain you know thats not what im going to do good shhh im right here lex im going to look after you im going to help your brother i want you to stay here and wait for me okay lets get you out tim lex shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did if i understand correctly all the system will come back on their original startup modes correct were talking my dear about a calculated risk which is the only option left to us we will never find the command nedry used he covered his tracks far too well and i think its obvious hes not coming back so shutting down the system where did the vehicles stop find nedry check the vending machines what now well nedry said a few systems would go offline didnt he what so how much for our first tour two noshows and one sick triceratops rotten luck this storm get my grandchildren on the radio will you i dont want them to worry about a wee bit of rain damn youre sure we have to stop the program stop the program good keep going now the cable will terminate in a big gray box well because youre a im a but you know i should really be the one going this is just a delay thats all this is all major theme parks have had delays when they opened disneyland in 1956 nothing worked nothing once we have control again we youre absolutely right yes youre right hiring nedry was a mistake thats obvious were over dependent on automation i can see that now but thats all correctable for the next time around but with this place i i wanted to give them something real something that wasnt an illusion something they could see and touch an aim devoid of merit a carousel and a seesaw they all moved motorized of course but people would swear they could see the fleas i see the fleas mummy cant you see the fleas clown fleas high wire fleas fleas on parade theyll all be fine who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert were still perfecting a viewing system the raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting give time theyll out draw the trex guarantee it fascinating animals fascinating could i have a tissue please there you are out you come come along i know my way around a kitchen come along im sorry for the dramatic entrance but im in a hurry will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then brakes no no brakes theyre electric cars guided by this track in the roadway and totally nonpolluting top of the line have a heart gentlemen their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion i dont believe it i expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one ive got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer thats conservative of course theres no reason to speculate wildly from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year donald this park was not built to carter only to the super rich everyone in the worlds got a right to enjoy these animals relax donald relax theyre scientists they ought to be curious no we dont have any animatronics here these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park fortyeight hours from now ill be accepting your apologies now get out of the way so i can see them and the concrete moats and the motion sensor tracking systems donald dear boy do try to relax and enjoy yourself after careful consideration dr grant so have i you four are going to have a little company out in the park spend a little time with our target audience maybe theyll help you get the spirit of this place ah theyre here yes yes yes which is why we take extreme precautions they viewing area below us will have eightinch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to robert robert muldoon my game warden from kenya bit of an alarmist im afraid but hes dealt with the raptors more than anyone wu sorry its kind of a ride we clocked the trex at thirtytwo miles an hour the brachiosaur thirty for a further three years i could compensate you by fully funding your dig well its right up your alley look why dont you both come on down for the weekend love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well ive got a jet standing by at choteau not to put a fine point on it your kind lets face it in your particular field youre the top minds if i could just get you two to sign off on the park you know give a wee testimonial i could get back on schedule schedule well im afraid i do theres one a particular pebble in my shoe he represents my investors he says they insist on outside opinions not just kids for everyone were going to open next year unless the lawyers kill me first i dont care for lawyers you john hammond and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant for today i guarantee it that will teach you to trust grandpa i think perhaps ill just sit down i dont suppose you think all that much of me now do you i dont understand this luddite attitude especially from a scientist how could we stand in the light of discovery and not act but this is nature why not give an extinct species a second chance i mean condors condors are on the verge of extinction if id created a flock of them on the island you wouldnt be saying any of this have anything to say at all you dont give us our due credit our scientists have done things no one could ever do before alright donald alright but just let him talk i want to hear all viewpoints i truly do i truly am your silence intrigues me dont do that a load if i may say so of fashionable number crunching thats all it is codswollop ian youve never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island youll have to get use to dr malcolm he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality especially for a mathematician i dont blame people for their mistakes but i do ask that they pay for them i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you dennis i really will not im sorry about your financial problems i really am but they are your problems robert i wonder if perhaps you would be kind good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren well tell them when they get back to the cars ray start the tour program why didnt i build in orlandoyes its not a criticism by the way yes thatll itd be a first man and dinosaur all die together johns plan must go faster go go open it up 5th gear 5th gear here it comes stand on it fifth stand on it 5th gear go must go faster its getting closer must go faster please chance it dino droppings no one could have predicted dr grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle and even if we havent seen it yet im quite sure its going on in this park right now microscopic never repeat and vastly affect the outcome thats what on your hand the amount of blood distending in your vessels imperfections in the skin it changed why okay back over your wrist because and here is the principle of tiny variations the orientations of the hairs it simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems its only principle is the butterfly effect a butterfly can flap its wings in peking and in central park you get rain instead of sunshine you see the tyrannosaur doesnt obey set patterns or park schedules its the essence of chaos god creates dinosaurs god destroys dinosaurs god creates man man destroys god man creates dinosaurs its antinature and scary i know its very exciting thats right will break through no nonlinear equations strange attractions dr sattler i refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction what what can we do oh my god youre sure when you got ta go you got ta go i know i didnt say i was scared kids get scared the kids okay you want to talk about this machines hate you you havent touched didnt touch anything were stopping weve stopped why oh im sorry are you two uh are i wish you the best luck by the way dr sattler shes not like uh available is she occasionally always on the lookout for the future ex mrs malcolm me oh hell yes three i love em i love kids anything at all can and does happen to ellie you will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything to grant shes uh tenacious not without massive sequence gaps so you two dig up dinosaurs wait a minute what do you mean worked everything is still off youre all right john youre okay its just you dont have intelligence you have thinktelligence you think narrowly and call it being focused you dont see the consequences youre very good at solving problems at getting answers but you just dont know the right questions theres nothing that great about discovery whats so great about discovery its a violent penetrative act that scars what it explores what you call discovery i call the rape of the natural world hold on this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam dinosaurs had their shot nature selected them for extinction your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didnt stop to think if they should science can create pesticides but it cant tell us not to use them science can make a nuclear reactor but it cant tell us not to build it dont you see the danger john inherent in what youre doing here genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet but you wield it like a kid whos found his dads gun john the kind of control youre attempting is not possible if theres one thing the history of evolution has taught us its that life will not be contained life breaks free it expands to new territories it crashes through barriers painfully maybe even dangerously but andwell there it is dr grant dr sattler youve heard of chaos theory john john i certainly have very clearly because of the behavior of the system in phase space john doesnt subscribe to chaos particularly what it has to say about his little science project chaotician actually chaoticianyeah in a box under my seat people were gettin bloody noses things on your head aneurisms up and down up and down dilophosaurus i cant see are you crazy what if you miss i hate it up here youre crazy im not gon na jump i cant im scared nope but my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls its good protein come on lex why dont you touch it look at his nose its so strong look at its nose

virus started you know like his point of origin everything jesus christ get that helmet if were going to play arcade i want every advantage possible go outside get your car and meet me out front with the engine running and make it quick okay were not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer learn some tricks and stuff i mean you dont want us kids

play the game you mean we learn the rules what i dont know give me a break alex what are we going to tell them excuse me officer but theres some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines id think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers its already out right and then communication satellites and then anywhere its growing getting stronger maybe its only localized now maybe it is alive

distinct impression i was kind of one of the rising stars around here and i feel that wasnt just my imagination and i also think i deserve to know whats really going on here charles really who thinks

counselor a carrot if youd lost confidence in me why did you give me the kronos suit honesty is always best i know that charles of course thanks charles it is and it isnt charles macrosystems new software copies all the bestknown elements of kronos spreadsheet program if theyre allowed to sell it kronos will get undersold right out of business for me the legal principle involved is copyright infringement hes upset hes sorry this is my partner we keep records of hospital visits nothing personal sounds delightful about my blood work thanks for coming by sure thing excellent work joe i thank you a good start what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean yes yes on my torso well many things but i think the thing i love the most is that every once in a while not that often but occasionally you get to be part of justice being done its really quite a thrill when that happens i love the law i know the law i excel at practicing it its the only thing ive ever wanted to do im an excellent lawyer you dont bring your personal life into a law firm youre not supposed to have a personal life really anyway i did plan to tell charles eventually but then this thing happened at the tennis club no i didnt i still am i suppose you could say that its possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time but i wasnt diagnosed until several years later possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law a razor sharp litigator a genuine leader gifted at bringing out the very best in others an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues courtrooms the person on the street the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesnt sweat but underneath the elegant surface was an adventurous spirit he was the kind of person i thought i wanted to be particularly charles ill look over the q and a want to hear my favorite aria thanks do you like opera ive made provisions in my will for some charities miguel will need a lawyer i know its not your area what happens theres a possibility i wont be around for the end of this trial what have you prayed for do you pray charles okay miller uh huh thank you for

find you a drink not bad i had a blood transfusion today i feel great its me you dork parrtyy any settlement agreement must include and this is critical a letter of exoneration making clear my

spotted a lesion on my forehead rayisha very nice whats her name im a lawyer hows your baby what fine dont send flowers joe im not dead yet thanks for your time look i know i have a case if you dont want to take it for personal reasons they sabotaged me joe from the day i arrived to the day they fired me i performed consistently thoroughly and with absolute excellence and if they hadnt fired me thats what id be doing today the law says people with disabilities can not be terminated so long as they can perform the duties required by their position as in the vegetable charles i must apologize again for the kronos mishap it was a scary few minutes around here wow but thank god the complaint was found and no damage was done makeup i dove back into work everything was fine until the lesions started miguel alvarez weve lived together for nine years my lover and i i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago during a bout of pneumonia i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days since i was doing so well on the azt we decided against telling anyone about it nine i misplaced an important complaint thats their story want to hear mine correct im seeking representation i was fired by wyant wheeler i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners kids are great congratulations new baby its okay can i sit down i have aids client of yours defined by websters as harmless your honor i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors drumming up business and the dust which counselor refers to has appeared on only three occasions each time it has been examined and the results get down to word processing help jamey look fucking word processing lost my kronos complaint which must be filed by fucking five oclock if its late theres no case every problem has a solution catch me later ill be here and tell amy i love her painting its on my wall rach no i cant really see it by the time i was fired there were four lesions on my face much bigger one here in front of my ear absolutely thats right yes miguel has not been infected as i said we werent aware of aids then or how it is spread yes in some situations some do i didnt no that is not correct i never lied about it no id heard of something the gay plague gay cancer but we didnt know how you could get it or that it could kill you that happened once people werent talking about aids then the way we are now or safe sex its impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv i guess it was 1984 85 yes yes gay movies not unnecessary ones in my work yes calculated risks you have to something like that thanks mom dad mom wheres dad hi mom how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary gillman says im fine my blood work is excellent tcells

chest in this mirror if it please the court id like to ask mr beckett to remove his shirt so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what were talking about do you have any lesions on any part of your body at this time that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired what do you love about it what makes you an excellent lawyer are you a good lawyer can you explain why you didnt in the years you worked at wyant wheeler did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay except you were gay a regular allamerican guy you didnt look then the way you look now obviously at this time you werent sick what kind of person is that what impressed you about him youre ready dont worry opera opera i know a good probate lawyer we proceed representing your estate ive considered that for a healthy baby for lisa to make it through the delivery for the phillies to get into the playoffs then we establish how wheelers boys recruited you after law school what beckett when you refer to wheeler call him charles to show how youd been admitted to the inner circle you were considered one of them lets review these notes for your testimony we have a big day on monday let me tell you something okay when youre brought up like the rest of us in a place like where i was brought up theres not a whole lot of discussion about homosexuals as a kid youre taught right away that queers are weird queers are funny theyre a danger to kids theyre afraid to fight and they all want to cop your joint and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there if you want to know the truth youre right you think im uncomfortable thank you sure its fine beer we need to go over your q and a get it im a law suit beckett you seem better energized more alive were friends of becketts one more thing your honor arline there is no relevant precedent so kenton connected the lesion and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life to this woman maria and blew the whistle on you suddenly youre losing files and its time to let you go but up to this point youve been their golden boy their rising star their behavior is inconsistent they didnt fire her how did they find out rayisha huh oh great shes great find a lawyer whod you get oh beckett hows it goin beckett im sorry about whats happened to you its a fucking kick in the head correct i dont i knew you were going to say that i dont buy it and i dont see a case okay they want you out its against the law to fire you for having aids so they make you look like a fuck up which leads us to the mysterious lost file okay okay they discover you have this horrible disgusting terminal illness and they panic for any number of perfectly valid reasons theyre frightened for themselves their families maybe its the homo angle maybe they dont want to rub elbows with someone whos just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake i buy that big trouble hell they are staring whats that shit on your face continue your lover we continue how many lawyers did you go to before you called me continue you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown thanks beckett im real excited about it what can i do for you little baby girl one week old uh yeah whoaoh sorry i jesus christ what happened to you funny i know what it means your honor imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper a tribute to mankinds greed grows daily casting an ominous shadow over their lives filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black toxic fog blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs and counselor calls it harmless innocuous your honor since rockwell corp began construction the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foulsmelling germcarrying pestilent dust my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage thank you no more questions what did you say your earrings in what way no have you ever felt discriminated against at wyant wheeler ms burton youre black your honor if mr beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair would the defense ask him to park it outside were talking about aids were talking about lesions lets see what were talking about objection ill withdraw you were aware when you worked with maria torres that she had aids correct ill rephrase did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced and when lawyers break the law when this society loses respect for the law when that day comes our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and grandchildren will live like savages uh no not really get real thanks doc but i dont need an aids test are you crazy but thanks for the information really it doesnt travel through the air by breathing or touching right the guy sat in my office you cant get aids that way right you want to give me an aids test why are we going to do that yeah but doc isnt it true they keep finding out new things about this disease so you tell me today theres no danger and i go home and i hold my baby and six months from now i hear on the news whoops we were wrong you can carry it on your clothes your skin and now ive got to worry about my kid what are you doing right im not worried what are you doing five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now youre calling him a cheeseburger your standards have shifted a great deal and id like to know why youve changed your mind its a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming do you agree did that thrill impress and overwhelm you okay mr laird explain this to me like im a four year old did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not according to the deposition you said you were thrilled impressed overwhelmed by the quality of andrew becketts work do you remember saying that mr laird when i approached you about being a witness at this trial and you agreed you gave sworn testimony in a deposition is that correct were you pleased with his work but andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 is that correct what kind of people explain to me if you can mr wheeler explain this to me like im a ten yearold this trial is not about a disease is that what youre saying not about your understandable if unfounded fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it youre saying this trial is about andrew becketts character am i getting this right but hes got lots of other peoples lives to ruin in a word yes youre in trouble youre the asshole buddy dont you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys relax i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you whats the matter with you do i look gay to you whoa whoa whoa whoa do you think you think im gay great good school what year ill see you in an hour max did i ever tell you i hate costume parties great lisa thank you lisa cmon one guy sticking his dick in another guys mouth its disgusting yeah very funny i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake is there some kind of expression ive picked up from beckett some kind of fairy attitude ive unconsciously adopted am i walking different some kind of vocal thing have i picked up some kind of homo vibe would you take a client if you were constantly thinking i hope this guy doesnt touch me i dont even want him to breathe on me and the way they work out pumping up so they can be macho and faggot at the same time i cant stand that shit now im being totally honest with you i mean two guys doing the horizontal thing i dont get it dont they get confused is that mine i thought it was yours hey call me old fashioned call me conservative i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is allright i admit it im prejudiced i dont want to work with a homosexual you got me since when your aunt teresa is gay that beautiful sensuous woman is a lesbian who how many do you know not especially you load the film no on this side or this side dont move the baby tell iris all about it take good care of mrs finley iris beckett come in of course you have a case now i want you to go with my assistant iris and fill out some forms shell tell you about our fee arrangement mrs finley any back pain since the accident dizziness nightmares why didnt you cross at the crosswalk but didnt you avoid contact with ms torres after you found out she had aids she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her is that correct so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise is that correct like firing andrew beckett taught him a lesson you taught him a lesson how did you do that like two sailors playing hide the salami so during those long voyages months at a time out to sea no women in sight a hundred hardworking robust young men in the prime of their life at the peak of their natural appetites desires their god given hormonal instincts anything going on any women on board whoa whoa what do you expect them to say youre alan dershowitz your honor may i have ten minutes in redirect you had one guy like that with all due respect your honor we dont live in this courtroom do we based on what my client would have earned over the next three years including benefits and projected raises and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars reinstatement at full salary back pay covering the period of unemployment and if it please your honor we hope to settle this matter ill take that under consideration your honor joseph miller your honor macready and shilts legal servicesnight honey my lettuce is wilting okay so help me with this one joe is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someones mouth or is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into their mouth two men making love now tell me again why is that disgusting joe have you

winners ladies and gentlemen the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel excuse me im not your lover im your care partner fuck thats right were on the positive plan you dont

feeling about them you ask them if they want to have a drink or this is not how you do it you want this on an english muffin or a bun she looks like my third grade teacher i hated my third grade
