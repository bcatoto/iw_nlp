brother is jason priestly available you mean for tv or print thats right your mom killed my brother are you chip sutphinapproximately fortyseven minutes sir sorry sir there is too much interference in the planets ionosphere for an accurate reading lifeforms tiny little lifeforms where are the lifeforms approximately two hundred thirty million veridian iii is uninhabited but veridian iv supports a preindustrial humanoid society it should be noted sir that the collapse of the veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at amargosa yes sir there are two in the veridian system i believe so i believe so this is its current position the destruction of the amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction according to our current information the destruction of the amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector gamma emissions have increased by 05 percent the starship bozeman was forced to make a course correction a research project on gorik iv was halted due to increased neutrino particles ambient magnetic fields have decreased by guilt it is a most unpleasant feeling but i did not deal with it sir i let it prevent me from helping my friend does that make me a coward i wanted to save geordi i tried but i experienced something i did not expect i believe it was fear no sir i am finding it difficult to concentrate i believe i am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory it will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information the stars destruction has had numerous astrophysical effects within this sector however none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon sorry captain the ribbon has already entered the galaxy it will pass through this sector in approximately thirtyone hours according to our information the ribbon is a conflux of temporal energy which travels through our galaxy every 391 years one minute to warp core breach i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays i am sorry but i can not stop myself i think something is wrong it appears to be a magnetically sealed i know i just got it it was very funny during the farpoint mission we were on the bridge and you told a joke that was the punchline i get it i get it i am uncertain i have had little experience with emotions i am unable to articulate the sensation i believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response agreed that is true however i believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse for thirtyfour years i have endeavored to become more human to grow beyond my original programming and yet i am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor this emotion chip is the only answer it has occurred to me on several occasions but i believe this may be the appropriate time i was attempting to get in the spirit of things i thought it would be humorous is she still angry i have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters attempting to level our descent perhaps yes if we sent a lowlevel ionic pulse it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems i hope so sir i am quitepreoccupied with concern about geordi sensors show five life signs aboard the station captainthats it bridge were all out we better get you back to the ship la forge to enterprise data are you all right data this isnt the time i dont see a control panel or an access port thanks the farpoint mission data that was seven years ago what you get what really what do you feel well but at the first sign of trouble im going to deactivate it agreed wait a minute i thought youve always been afraid it would overload your neural net data youre not thinking about using that thing are you no but id stay out of sickbay for a while if i were you i still dont know why you dropped her in the water i told you everything you might as well just kill me right now no i didnt know that yeah theyre full of great ideas guinan i dont know what youre talking about no i was ordered to by the captain what do you want whats normali have to find a way to get to soran commander population are any of them inhabited and destroy every planet in the system thats where hes going he cant go to the ribbon so hes trying to make the ribbon come to him data is it going to pass near any mclass planets now you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered could that also affect the course of the ribbon courage is an emotion too data now can you project the course of the ribbon can you project its course wait the bozemanwhy did it change course no and what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which i believe youre beginning to experience guilt fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome its something we all have to learn to deal with what do you mean data are you all right give me a list of those effects i want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed no matter how insignificant guinan said soran was trying to get back to the ribbon if thats true then there must be some connection with the amargosa star data when is it expected back youre right ill need help guinan will you come back with me together we could i know exactly where i want to go and when back to that mountaintop on veridian iii before soran put out the star i have to stop him i dont understand can i guinan can i leave the nexus these are my childrenmy children where is he now soran left behind guinan what are you doing here i thought you were on the enterprise but i never had a wife children a home like this this is the nexus guinan whats going on where am i but why destroy a star thank you guinan your sixth sense ive always wondered where it came from and what about soran what happened to you whats the nexus guinan its important that you tell me what you know we think sorans developed a weapona terrible weapon it might give him enough power to do you remember him yes thank you ill find a way to contact the enterprise youre going to be all right you could say that thats right i hadnt planned on it thats right antonia better youre a starfleet officer and you have a duty to not exactly as i said this is some kind of im from what you would consider the future the 24thcentury yes yes it is you may still somehow i doubt this will be the last ship to carry the name enterprise too big how long until the ribbon arrives theyre just trying to decide whether a twenty yearold klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship how is that possible report no thank you understood that will be all thank you number one is there a problem hmm inform starfleet command this could indicate a new romulan threat in this sector theres still no indication of why they attacked the station make it so imagine what it was like will no engines no computers just the wind the sea and the stars to guide you well now that were all aboard8a number one bring the ship before the wind lets see whats out there dont you think youre taking this a little too far number one mr data scan the planet for lifeforms my brother had shouldered that burden allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs ever since i was a little boy i remember hearing about the family line the picards that fought at trafalgar the picards that settled the first martian colony when my brother married and had a son in a way he was as close as i ever came to having a child of my own what i cant get out of my mind is the image of rene my nephew i just cant believe hes gone all right all right youve made your point well with all due respect to your betazoid senses i prefer to be alone right now as ships counselor its your duty to know not only when youre needed but also when youre not well i appreciate your concern but id rather not discuss it right now thank you counselor what can i do for you yes fine if youll excuse me thank you the nexus were all mortal soran its one of the truths of ou existence not if it means killing over two hundred million people i wonder did your wife leandra know that she married a man who was capable of mass murder the thought had crossed my mind were doing the best we can now if youll excuse me doctor were still conducting an investigation into the attack once weve completed our work well be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory until then nothing for me i understand theres something urgent you need to discuss with me doctor sorani dont follow i dont know a couple months why well work something out im sure youll be happy with it i know we asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked look how about we get in touch

that randal forget it oh please im surprised i didnt kill you jesus thanks why the fuck did you tell veronica that i was going to dump her for caitlin the swellings not so bad but the fds stings hows

shit my pants jesus h christ i cant i cant all right jesus would you leave me alone i cant make changes like that in my life if i could i wouldbut i dont have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes what do you want me to say yes i suppose some of the things youre saying may be true but thats the way things are its not going to change caitlin and i cant be together its impossible youre wrong things happened today okay things that probably ruined my chances with caitlin if i wasnt such a fucking coward it must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do leave me alone leave her out of this thank you why dont you go back to the video store oh like your lifes any better leave me alone as if its that easy what responsibility fuck you what are you talking about i should shit or get off the pot i was born my life is in the shitter right about now so if you dont mind id like to stew a bit im stuck in this pit

catatonic after fucking a dead guy and my present girlfriend has sucked thirtysix dicks why do i have this life this life what time did we go to the funeral would you shut the fuck up who the fuck is

and were going out im not shes not going to marry that guy she went home to tell her mother im not she just left no im happy because caitlin came to see me im happy because im happy i swear i couldnt make this kind of hell up because im here as opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here little girl maybe five years old i dont you did living proof five hundred dollars i got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor and this is what you rented whatd you rent best of both worlds please get the hell out of here youre a danger to both the dead and the living what jesus what the fuck did you do that for thats stretching it youre not being asked to slay children or anything exactly what its going to have to do for now considering that its my car thats up for request can i help you theres a difference those were obligations obligations that could not have been met at any later date now renting videosthats just gratuitous not to mention illogical considering you work in a video store we are employees of quick stop convenience and rst video respectively as such we have certain responsibilities whichthough it may seem cruel and unusualdoes include manning our posts until closing may i be blunt with you can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time you work in a video store you want to rent a movie why should i loan you my car i dont want to talk to you just go go open the video store her fucking body fell out does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose you knocked the fucking casket over for chrissakes i cant fucking believe you i cant help it at least when we were playing hockey outside i could see if anyone wanted to go in i know it was a bad idea to close the store yeah like you said you know i guess everyone tries it sooner of later you know i could never reach he made it hunhh his dick was in his mouth who found him because i never tried to suck my own dick no oh my god stop it shut the hell up thats embarrassing howd he die an embarrassing way to die twentytwo same as us thanks for putting me in a tough spot youre a good friend exactly which means i cant close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake i cant close the store im not taking you to this funeral she meant nothing to you dont be an asshole somebody has to stay with the store you hate people stop it this is beneath even you you hardly knew her youve got ta watch the store i have to go to this shit what about tomorrow what why not im gon na go to her wake number six i havent seen her in almost two years jesus how when oh my god yeah right i still cant believe caitlins getting married its not like were gon na sell out exactly they drank it all gatorade randal twelve minutes is not a game jesus its barely a warmup one ball they come all the way here i close the damn store for one ball were not playing in the street i dont know you going to lock the video store can we not talk about this at least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here i just want to play hockey like i was scheduled to i told him i had a game today its his own fault pull my laces tighter youve got a customer i cant believe im going to miss the game sorry would you shut the hell up with that shit its not helping im going to miss the game you know what pisses me off the most i dont back

happy about it but ive been able to deal veronica because my exgirlfriend is getting married no which ones the women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date as if somewherebeyond all the other gallonsis a container of milk that wont go bad for like a decade the milkmaids its not really anyone per se its more of separate groupings there arent what for they dont bother me if i dont bother them im gon na hear it tomorrow why do you do things like that you know shes going to come back and tell the boss can we talk about this later what kind of show i guess not nudie booth whats a jizzmopper did you ever notice all the prices end in nine damn thats eerie ill give him five more minutes then im calling the cops i dont need this man im not even supposed to be here today he said it was important to have standards he said nobody has pride anymore i told him that and he yelled at me obviously not look at all the cartons that didnt make the grade each egg has to be perfect he said he has to find a perfect dozen this guy is going through all of the eggs look wait all right so even if independent contractors are working on the death star why are you uneasy with its destruction not just imperials is what youre getting at so and the second time around basically and you figured it out compliments of lando calrissian luke blew it up give credit where its due yeah theres more i think they were catholics more or less it would stand to reason yes yeah i guess how do you mean the emperor whats that empire had the better ending luke gets his hand cut off and finds out vaders his father han gets frozen and taken away by boba fett it ends on such a down note and thats lifea series of down endings all jedi had was a bunch of muppets empire didnt you hear me caitlin really is getting married me pulling a can off some morons fist do you know that article is accurate caitlins really getting married all four i think its safe to say yes i think the arguments veronica and i are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that i can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with caitlin and shes looking to me for support and i think that this is leading our relationship to a new level im talking to myself here they are when she calls me now shes a different personshes frightened and vulnerable shes about to finish college and enter the real world thats got to be scary for anyone im serious aside from the cheating we were a great couple thats what high schools all aboutalgebra bad lunch and infidelity because there was a lot of good in our relationship it takes different strokes to move the world the two moved to idaho together after graduation they raise sheep allan harris interesting postscript to that story do you know who wound up going with brad michaelson in the other dark bedroom great story isnt it she was supposed to meet brad michaelson in a bedroom she picked the wrong one she had no idea i was even at the party i hit the lights and she freaks turns out she thought i was brad michaelson she called me brad in the middle of it she calls me brad party at john kssenior year i get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom caitlin comes in and dives all over me eight and a half five years seven months you win i guess its not really fighting she just wants me to leave here go back to school get some direction one fight a day with veronica is about all i can stomach thanks she called me you dont want to know why no thanks dont screw with it it makes us look suspicious shocking abuse of authority go open the sore he assured me that hed be here by twelve thats what i said someone jammed gum in the locks the boss called arthur fell ill youre late jesus

weight of the world rests on your shouldersthat the store would crumble if dante wasnt here well i got news for you jerk this store would survive without you without me either all you do is overcompensate for having whats basically a monkeys job you push fucking buttons any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs but youre obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important so much more epic than it really is you work in a convenience store dante and badly i might add and i work in a shitty video store badly as well you know that guy jays got it right he has no delusions about what he does us we like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here just looking to pick up a paper orgod forbid cigarettes we look down on them as it were so advanced well if were so fucking advanced then what are we doing working here hermaphrodites i rented it so we could watch it together its not like im miles away to talk to you like ten after how do

fucking a dead guy for thirty years i call him dad am i right or what if you want caitlin then face veronica tell her and be with caitlin if you want veronica be with veronica but dont pine for one and fuck the other man if you werent such a fucking coward you date veronica because shes low maintenance and because its convenient meanwhile all you ever do is talk about caitlin you carry a torch for a girl you dated in high schoolin high school for gods sake youre twentytwo its the same thing with veronica im satisfied with my situation for now you dont hear me bitching you on the other hand have been bitching all day youre comfortable this is a life of convenience for you and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm youve fashioned for yourself it is you just up and quit there are other jobs and they pay better money youre bound to be qualified for at least one of them so whats stopping you all right if you hate this job and the people and the fact that you have to come in on your day off then quit its true youll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is im talking about this thing you have this inability to improve your situation in life yeah you should shit or get off the pot you should shit or get off the pot thats all bullshit you know what the real problem here is thirtyseven have some chips youll feel better this life what whats with you you havent said anything for like twenty minutes what the hell is your problem i think four around three or something she

little bathroom bambam bunch of savages in this town hey caitlins in the back you might want to see if shes okay shes been back there a long time all right but youre missing out chicks with dicks you

starlets with both organs you should see the box beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame get to work i know im your hero i like to think im a master of my own destiny if title dictated my behavior as a clerk serving the public i wouldnt be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy but i did so my point is that people dictate their own behavior hence even though im a clerk in this video store i choose to go rent videos at big choice agreed and two to make a point title does not dictate behavior two reasons one i hate when the people cant shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines not yet the reasons you wont let me borrow your car is because i have a title and a job description and im supposed to follow it right so your argument is that title dictates behavior you know what i dont think i care for your rationale i see so playing hockey and attending wakesthese practices are standard operating procedure if you must let me borrow your car whats that for i want to rent a movie fine just lend me your car let me borrow your car so theyll put her back in its not like its gon na matter if she breaks something so the casket fell over big deal i was just leaning on it it was an accident im telling you it wasnt my fault nobodys there its four oclock on a saturday how many people ever come to the store at four on a saturday listen to you i never tried it what your

no because you wont admit to it as if a guys a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself youre as curious as the rest of us pal youve tried it yeah sure youre so repressed come on havent you ever tried to suck your own dick i swear bible truth he broke his neck trying to suck his own dick broke his neck thats nothing compared to how my cousin walter died an embolism in a pool she was pretty young hunhh you were saying you just closed the store to play hockey on the roof im going with you she meant nothing to you either until i told you she died if you go i go but i love gatherings isnt it ironic im not missing whats probably going to be the social event of the season true but do you know how many people are going to be there all of our old classmates to say the least wait wait wait has it occurred to you that i might bereaved as well one night only shes buried in the morning paulsens funeral parlor the next show is at four its today no youre not youve had sex with a dead person correct me if im wrong but wasnt she one of the illustrious twelve she was swimming at the ymca pool when it happened died midbackstroke embolism in her brain yesterday sanfords brother dates her cousin he found out this morning no im serious julie dwyer died you know what sanford told me after an exhausting game like that i can believe it what happened to all the gatorade bitch bitch bitch you want something to drink hockeys hockey at least we got to play helluva game then wherere we gon na play look who youre asking here howre we gon na block off the street are you gon na lock the store design major hes blunt but hes got a point no argument here insubordination rules ive got ta tell you my friend this is one of the ballsiest moves ive ever been privy to i never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy at least were stuck here together see there you go again dont yell at me pal because you buckled the fact that im right about your buckling yes you do you always back down you assume blame that isnt yours you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off you buckle like a belt that seems to be the leitmotif in your life ever backing down i heard you apologize why you have every right in the world to be mad whyd you apologize so whatyoure stuck here all day he didnt mention it when he called you this morning vermont smokey three thumbs up am i right thirtyseven jesus you got a onetrack mind its always caitlin caitlin caitlin why not all of them you know who i can do without i could do without the people in the video store the milkmaids lets hear it how can you lie like that why dont you vent vent your frustration come on who pisses you off liar tell me there arent customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis you got ta loosen up my friend youd feel a hell of a lot better if youd rip into the occasional customer who cares that ladys an asshole everybody that comes in here is way too uptight this job would be great if it wasnt for the fucking customers the jizzmoppers job is to clean up the booths afterward because practically everybody shoots a load against the window and i dont know if you know or not but cum leaves streaks if you dont clean it right away think of the weirdest craziest shit youd like to see chicks do these chicks do it all they insert things into any opening in their body any opening hes led a very sheltered life oh its great you step into this little booth and theres this window between you and this naked woman and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks nudie booth youve never been in a nudie booth hes the guy in those nudiebooth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off you know how much money the average jizzmopper make per hour its not like you laid the eggs yourself what did he say why doesnt he just mix and match the quest isnt going well perfect dozen whats he looking for shes in here youll never believe what this unruly customer just said all those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed casualties of a war they had nothing to do with all right lookyoure a roofer and some juicy government contract comes your way you got the wife and kids and the twostory in suburbiathis is a government contract which means all sorts of benefits all of a sudden these leftwing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a threemile radius you didnt ask for that you have no personal politics youre just trying to scrape out a living exactly in order to get it built quickly and quietly theyd hire anybody who could do the job do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main all they know is killing and white uniforms a construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the imperial army had to offer ill bet there were independent contractors working on that thing plumbers aluminum siders roofers the second time around it wasnt even finished yet they were still under construction so when they blew it up no prob evil is punished well the thing is the first death star was manned by the imperial army storm troopers dignitariesthe only people onboard were imperials something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it i could never put my finger on itsomething just wasnt right and the second one was still being built when they blew it up now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the rebels destroyed it so they build another death star right you know what else i noticed in jedi the only problem is that at no point in the series did i ever hear leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief hence the empire was a fascist theocracy and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution then wouldnt that logically mean that its a theocracy if the head of the empire is a priest of some sort then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion now hes in charge of the empire the imperial government is under his control and the entire galaxy is under imperial rule well hes like the pope for the dark side of the force hes a holy man a shaman kind of albeit an evil one right the emperor now the emperor is kind of a spiritual figure yes all right vaders boss there was something else going on in jedi i never noticed it until today blasphemy which did you like better jedi or the empire strikes back return of the jedi you know what i just watched you veronica caitlin and caitlins fiancï½ then i think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over caitlins on the same wavelength what about veronica no no im listening shes leaving college and oh shit ive got to place an order you think things

lifestyles thats frightening chess team allan harris your mother that girl was vile to you oh my god what do you mean thats not cheating people say crazy shit during sex one time i called this girl

parties and get me transvestites i need transvestites are you sure this is okay do you want me to get it for you hey bela how do you do that ugh i hate the way she interrupts the pictures she doesnt

star ah you got ta be jokin a great man like you ill bet you have dozens of em lined up boy mr lugosi you must lead such an exciting life when is your next picture coming out dont you bave a car i waited to get your autograph but you never came outside i thought it was great you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie you know i saw you perform dracula in poughkeepsie in 1938 really why were you buying a coffin i dont want anything im just a really big big fan ive seen all your movies no i dont work here excuse me mr lugosi if you say so this is gon na be belas laboratory so it should be real impressive like one of those mad scientist movies i want beakers and test tubes and one of those electrical things that buzzes ssh hes so big hes a monster can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie ive never seen anything like him jesus are you serious i dunno lie on the beach i dont know where no its fine its real in actuality lobo would struggle with that problem every day what do you mean sound um okay roll camera whats to protect it was perfect and cut print it lets move on places everyone roll camera no it has to be underwater you dont understand the octopus is supposed to live in a lake you cant sit you got ta walk around with good posture you want these people to think we have class otherwise theyll never invest in our movie what do you think youre doin what happened jesus connie what did you do absolutely its just the beginning i promise this if we stick together one day ill make every single one of you famous this is the big moment yeah it seems a little crazy but sometimes you just know shes perfect for me i told you the octopus is made of rubber this is a piece o cake cris you made it thanks a lot its that easy i dont understand hey cris howd you know wed be living on mars by 1970 howd you know it wouldnt be 1975 or even 1980 hhowd you know edward wood sir wow look he doesnt have any money but ill give you everything ive got i have a few hundred dollars isnt he will he be okay excuse me doctor im with mr lugosi how is he but you used to say did you really mean those things you said dolores wait dolores i got five days to shoot this movie quit kidding around oh er well youre the file clerk youre hurrying into the next room when you bump into janet hey the movies getting made thats the main thing none but his dad gave me fifty grand thats tony mccoy hes playing lieutenant dick craig thats right honey you made it i wasnt sure you got my message does she have room for me so what look we got ta figure out where were gon na stay i didnt dump you get it through your skull i just recast the part look how many times can i say im sorry i blew it i thought she was rich maybe if youd come to the backers party i wouldve gotten the money goddamn landlord the secretary or the file clerk but theres plenty of other parts im sorry what did you want me to say it was the only way i could get the movie made dolores dont you understand im a director now i made glen or glenda directing is my day job thats the problem nobody cares about my movie im tryin so hard i dont know what else to do tell him bride is in pre production all i wan na do is tell stories the things i find interesting bela needs a job i cant even get a film going but of course i cant i made the worst movie of all time im no good exactly look on the bright side if we miss the rent whats the worst they can do but you do and anyway ive got tons of new scripts and now that i have a track record studios are bound to hire me who cares were on a roll these are the moments in life youre supposed to grab from today on our lives are different well be swimming laps in the same pool jean harlow did some weirdo who likes to wear dresses say it a little louder i dont think bela heard you in his trailer hon nobodys bothered but you look around they couldnt care less it takes me comfortable its a damn good role of course it is and thats why you should play the part this is my way of telling you since i was a kid my mom wanted a girl so she used to dress me in girlie clothing it just kinda became a habit well id really like to know what you think why dont you go in the bedroom and take a look at it ill wait its a shame hes such a rest actor and nobody uses him anymore no hes very alive well sort of hes old and frail but hes still bela lugosi and hes really nice oh the hell with you i met bela lugosi close the other one no a horror movie star yeah i met a movie star somebody really big huh oh uh no i didnt get the job but something better happened sweetie you wont believe it ive got the most incredible news aw er its just a bunch of hot air i had to say something to get in the door i know but sometimes i get scared this is as good as its gon na get orson welles was 26 when he made citizen kane im already 30 honey what if im wrong what if i just dont have it the ghost can be barefoot give me your shoes dolores give me your shoes the other sixtythousand you said youd give me yeah well i need the other sixtythousand i kinda need it now yeah exactly sorry to bother you while were shooting but the guy who owns the stage needs his money i dont know hey bill which dress is better for you the green or the red one oh of course theres a couple characters youd be perfect for the secretary at the newspaper office or the file clerk perhaps youd like to look at the photoplay for this one we need 60000 so my associate mr marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture i understand you just moved here well uh if i could i would thats not true no hes not do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years dracula the raven the black cat sure thing mr kravitz well ive got another project i wasnt gon na tell you about lugosis in it but hes got a smaller part the lead is an ingenue a sterling young actress named dolores fuller the title is bride of the atom but bela lugosis in it dr acula well mr feldman i dont believe in thinking small so ive got a whole slate of pictures for you the vampires tomb the ghoul goes west and doctor acula nobody in town has seen it so im givin you first crack at my talents i just made this picture over at screen classics it opens next week well mr feldman some people have resumes to show ive got my own movie its wood ed wood we are gon na finish this film just the way i want it because you cant compromise an artists vision mr reynolds people wont notice filmmaking isnt about picky details its about the big picture i like to think so and perfect cut look lugosi is dead and vampira wont talk ihad to give somebody the dialogue its plenty its the acorn that will grow a great oak ill just find a double to finish his scenes and well release it as bela lugosis final film yes but ive got the last footage he ever shot yeah well weve got a big star bela lugosi its a guaranteed blockbuster from outer space its science fiction very big with the kids if you make this picture youll have enough money to finance a hundred religious films and pay my back rent from the profits graverobbers from outer space its money in the bank absolutely you see this script okay you know what you do you produce a film in a commercially proven genre and after its a hit you take the profits from that and make the twelve apostles movies raising money is tough you could say that im real sorry my stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account cmon in ill write you another one yeah hruphh were escaping dont worry were almost there but i thought me and dolores had something tor i should be getting home id be happy too if i had such a great family uh i dont have much of an appetite lately heres the scene loretta youre in a trance you glide in and get on the operating table now tor youre supposed to tie her down but you have an angora fetish and when you rub that swatch of angora it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you tor dialogue is overrated you look at the classic film actors who are they fairbanks chaplin they didnt talk they did it all with their face but tor its a starring part youre second billed really was the third act too intense hopefully very soon im just awaiting the final okay from mr feldman at mgm so anyway ive got this new script bride of the atom and theres a part youre ideal for lobo hes tough a brute but he has a heart and at the end he saves the girl nah that doesnt matter its a visual medium well i think youd be a sensation in pictures i think youre quite handsome tor have you ever thought about becoming an actor so mr johnson oh of course glad you could fit me in your schedule mr welles is it all worth it and they always want to cast their buddies it doesnt even matter if theyre right for the part aint that the truth ive even bad producers recut my movies i cant believe it these sound like my problems oh um im ed wood so what are you working on now uh uh im a young filmmaker and a really big fan and i just wanted to meet you excuse me sir you cant talk that way about my movie maybe it needs special handling why not georgie whats with the stag footage you said you were cutting in establishing shots but im proud i wrote directed and starred in it just like orson welles in citizen kane why i did all those things hell i even built the props um i guess gee i used every frame of film we shot maybe they wont notice yeah whatever so did you like it i know a guy in universals stock house hes giving me the footage for free this movies gon na look like a million bucks dont worry were not gon na film any of it so change the poster trust me youll be better off this is a story thats gon na grab people its about this guy hes crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses should he tell her should he not tell her hes torn george this is drama i dont think hes a schmuck theres still a sexchange because hes my friend uh yeah our picture no hes not dead he lives in baldwin hills i met him recently and he wants to be in our picture yeah lugosi what if i told you you could have a star for 1000 no it would be something better something impressive the biggest moneymaker youve ever had yeah but if you took that crap and put a star in it youd have something no better than tits a star mr weiss i was thinkin about what you said about how all your movies have to make a profit and i realized whats the one thing that if you put in a movie itll be successful yeah i know what its like to live with a secret and worry about what people are gon na think of you my girlfriend still doesnt know why her sweaters are always stretched out confidentially i even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties ill tell ya i wasnt scared of being killed but i was terrified of getting wounded and having the medics discover my secret nah im all man i even fought in ww2 course i was wearing ladies undergarments under my uniform no no not at all i love women wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them well mr weiss ive never told anyone what im about to tell you but i really want this job i like to dress in womens clothing well mr weiss im your guy i work fast and im a deal i write and direct and im good i just did a play in hollywood and victor crowley praised its realism is there a script so youre not gon na make the movie yes im ed wood im here about directing the christine jorgensen picture so its only a fivehour drive and itll probably clear up once we hit the desert heck itll probably clear up once we drive around the corner i promise right now lets drive to vegas lets get married cmon lets just go i cant get it to go up whos dr tom hell if i did i wouldnt have any friends yeah i should give her a call those assholes yes bingo solar energy oh thats gon na seem so scientific this movies gon na be the ultimate ed wood film no compromises no bigger whats the biggest energy no theyre beyond that theyre smarter than the humans whats more advanced the left its more natural hey ive got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb what would that be made of you know when you rewrite a script it just gets better and better i was a fuckin hack i let people recut the movies cast their relatives i let bela down i might as well be i made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see i blew it all he wanted was a comeback that last glory id seen him in a coffin so many times i expected him to jump out bela died thanks its actually the only thing i know how to make hey can you grab that strainer stop okay no i love sex with girls i like to wear womens clothes panties brassieres sweaters pumps its just something i do and i cant believe im telling you but i really like you and i dont want it getting in the way down the road kathy im about to tell you something ive never told any girl on a first date but i think its important that you know i like to wear womens clothes i had to sleep with the lights on for a month but i never missed a lugosi picture after that what do you mean yeah dont forget mercury theatre and then every saturday id go to the little movie theater down the street i even started ushering

piece with bela lugosi and swedish wrestler tor johnson and i saw you here and i thought kismet excuse me miss vampira that was karloff paul you got ta try harder i dont want this film to be haifassed

hot metal ben ben i dont know if this thingll change us back or make us worse i need you to be patient for a little while longe were working as hard as we can ben this isnt permanent johnny we need to be careful until were normal again okay well skip that question ben im afraid ive got to ask okay ive uh got some questions from sue that she thought might be better coming from me can you you know go to the bathroomlike normal if were going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes we had a tough year ben are you okay are you alright hes smart powerful successful what come on shes got a good thing with victor yeah you and debbie and perfect i should have done more run more tests i dont know i just keep going over and over the numbers three days i was worried about you how are you feeling ben this is serious turn around the shields on the station should protect us victors better at these things hes made a few changes i had it at four when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do im sure hes matured since then youthful high spirits external srbs orbital system engines its just like the shuttles you flew in we got what we wanted thats enough ben think about all the people we can help if this works ben the moneys not important we could save lives ben this is business just work hes financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century this wasnt our first stop in case you forgot nasa and victors not that bad hes just a little larger than life now johnny supernova a higher calling like getting girls and making money you need to control yourself and think before you thats what im trying to calculate and its not rubber its muscle tendon i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to theyre not costumes what no im trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms is there something about flames about flaming that you not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to earths atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it back it down johnny and figure out how to reverse them let me show you to your rooms we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes oh it is ben grimm is a genuine american hero whos been through a terrible orde youve been working out ben are you there the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna hes not responsive victors right johnny get to the command center close the shields but im not done with the machine what are you doing here victor if we could understand what happened to us i ruined with all due respect i told you to abort not much we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage hes had some kind ofreaction to exposure from the cloud and hes not the only one ben did this not until ben is back inside come on ben come on bens still out there weve got minutes until it hits not hoursvictor that storms deadly the radiations lethal we need to abort sure hilarious you back this mission and ill sign over a fair percentage of any applications or not at all you remember in school we talked about working together thats what i was about to explain i found a broken gasket from space sue i need some of that anger rage frustration the poweri needmore powerto controlthe storm i canmake it work why didnt you say something you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach youspeak his mind one who wasnt afraid to tell you what he wanted you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late you were i could get ben to tap into the baxters main power to generate enough voltage im not the only one in there i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there which is why im working twenty hours a day checking every variable he was going to take away all my data equipment no way to know without more tests experiments with the right energy we can stabilize the storm maybe tie into the city grid of course of course curing countless diseases not just ours if we can build a machine to recreate the storm we can reverse the polarity the plants from space their particles are still charged with the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm there were a lot of variables to consider i think it was a little more complicated than no i distinctly remember you walked out my door ergo i mean you broke up with me right what in the world would give me that idea okay is there any way to duplicate that feeling some memory or im saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger can you remember the exact emotions when you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better its not invisibility per se youre bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field thats what you projected on the bridge thats what were here to find out sue your clothes lose them we need to get past them lets not jump to conclusions we need a imassive amount of evidencei before making that leap sueilook at your handsi uh sue i cant for science passion i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship thats good thats uhgood feeling better material made from selfregulating unstable molecules ive been working on a formula for this as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission i uh think i remember the number well uh based on our historyyou can handle the biogenetics and ill focus on the molecular physics or uhm maybe i should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and youre youve i mean how have you beehe couldnt generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass yet another mistake for mr fantastic he also said wed avoid that storm in space and we know how that turned out to help you ive run every test known to man and they all yield the same result the machine is ready where do you think with sue ben come in come on let me buy you something to eat looks like you could use the company im worried about you thats terrible news what what do you mean complete like the shields reed said would protect us how long and theyre changing into front page make sure you find ben bring him back here and keep it quiet i dont need this to hit the press thats why because i could have any other woman you know when they asked caesar why england he said because its not mine later first ive got some unfinished business a deal that needs closing and thats a good thing get me on the am shows larry king cover of the journal ive got to do something about this scar make sure they only shoot my right side reeds disaster you know i half think he did this to me on purpose hows the ipo leonard hows the feed history leonard history everything else is conversation hows the other matter its not just the money i could make money in my sleep showtime reeds always right good thing he doesnt always know what hes got if reeds right then this little trip will double our stock offering which is precisely the point analysis is over its time for action my men could have mass produced this by now what i should have done a long time ago applications and patents reed this all belongs to me i dont want to understand it this isnt one of your science projects i just want to fix it fast abort reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool didnt go as planned it was a catastrophe you ruined the lives of four people im starting to wonder the same thing how much do you know about what happened to you ben did this just a little banged up a couple scrapes why its too late for him and soon itll be too late for all of us reed were running out of time so reel him in but we came here to do a job so lets do it quickly get a grip reed we didnt come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch just close the shields got it so take a walk benim going to borrow susan for a second funny how things turn out isnt it the numbers seventyfive and its applications and patents this isnt going to be a problem is it but dreams dont pay the bills do they same old reed the hopeless optimist still reaching for the stars with the world on your back oh i think you already have then why is reed dragging his feet maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass its ironic isnt it youre finally the perfect woman for himbecause youre his science project same old reed all analysis no action wasnt that the problem with you two susan what are you doing it is theres something we need to talk about something i need to ask you please no apologies ive arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos youll have roundthe clock care i told you im fine its you im worried about just find him whats going on raising the shields sue ive lived my life unafraid of taking big steps and this is the biggest step yet if it helps think of this as a promotion a merger of sorts four little words that can change our lives right of course the company but you see ive come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with well when youre looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past surprised i agreed to reeds proposal i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm for your sake i hope youre right im sorry if that sounds a little skeptical im just saying i know what its like to lose something you love to see it slip away and know its never coming back i know it cant be easy life hasnt changed that much for reed sue and johnny at least they can go out in public but for you people staring whispering behind your backi lied your life ive

call you deer hahahahaha seriously amy the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call karma the great circle of life death and rebirth that kind of person would come back as a wildebeest or a warthog no i think it more likely that you were a gazelle with long graceful legs gamboling through the underbrush perhaps we met once a chance encounter in a forest glade i must have been an antelope or an ibex what times we must have had foraging together for sustenance picking the grubs and burrs from one anothers coats or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways oh no amy pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched what do you think you were in your previous life amy well the hindus say and the beatniks also that in the next life some of us will come back as ants some will be butterflies others will be elephants or creatures of the sea every year you dont say no in vidalia farm route 17 you know on farm route 17 didja ever go to the top of old man larsons feed tower and look out over the town oh i dont blame them really i guess i have sort of made a mess of things these folks have to protect their investment most of them are very nice people i

youre the one person whos been standing by me through all this thanks people seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story sid found me the icepack oh nothing really just the more timid investors are no longer running for cover i bet thats exactly what she tells herself but you and i both know shes just a driedup bitter old maid say how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work i was thinking maybe the king and i exactly and i bet shes ugly real ugly otherwise why wouldnt they print her picture next to her byline yeah you know probably dresses in mens clothing swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or yeah you know suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays seems pretty obvious doesnt it shes probably very unattractive and bitter about it yeah you know probably one of these fasttalking career gals thinks shes one of the boys probably is one of the boys if you know what i mean well its done now whats the use of grousing about it forget the letter amy i just had to blow off some steam well she probably had a deadline aww naw amy that wont be necessary i shouldnt send it shes just doing her job i guess you know for kids oh sure youre biased youre a fellow muncian but would an imbecile come up with this go on tell the truth i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion well you know me amy at least better than that that dame does do you think im an imbecile these preposterous inventions would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter but i doubt it i most seriously doubt it as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years yours sincerely et cetera the picture was fine its what that knuckleheaded dame wrote underneath of all the irresponsible amy take this down dear miss archer i call you miss because you seem to have missed the boat completely on this one how on earth would you know whether im an imbecile when you

page of todays manhattan argus please norville a muncie girl can you beat that oh of all the foolish listen do you take shorthand are you familiar with the mimeograph machine dont bother to thank me

barging in here and taking up my valuable time ive got a company to run here say the hula hoop such a success nobody wants a harebrained product like this ya see buzz it lacks the creative spark the unalloyed genius that made uh this is the most idiotic thing ive ever seen in my life why this is worthless oh uh buzz is it important roast tom turkey gee im hungry too well i i fortyfourth floor and its very but sid let me urge you to work closely with the new president and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies but not your soul for while we must strive for success we must not worship it long live the hud waring hudsucker and so sid the future does not belong to such as i nor even you we have made our compromises with time the future belongs to the young who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption accordingly in the spirit of hope and the ringing in of the new i hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company and my seat on the board to whomever is hudsuckers most recent employee at the time of my demise i know this will disappoint you you sid who have served so diligently and for so long but many years uh i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on ending my tenure at hudsucker and here on earth you will be thinking why now when things are going so well granted from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials sure sure were doing fine however sid these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company now i see only an empty shell whom others call a success how has this come to pass when and why did i trade all of my hopes dreams and aspirations for the emptiness of power and wealth what the heck have i done from the desk of waring hudsucker to sidney j mussburger regarding my demise dear sid by the time you read this i will have joined the organization upstairs an exciting new beginning i will retain fond memories of the many years you and i yes sir sir yessir geez i oh geez huh oh geez mr hudsucker i apologize there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i mustve mislaid yes sir norville but look im president of the company now and i well im not sure where i good afternoon to ya this is norville barnes thisll only take a moment you have a charming wife mr muss uh sid i havent had that must have been quite a disappointment mrs mussburger huh he no i hes just maybe i was a little rough on the boy ya see i hows that sid ya dont say sorry im late sid that back nine at riverdale is really murder well im for it so if you think its appropriate id like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch but theres such an enormous potential profitwise given the demographics baby boom discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class thank you sid but the reason i mention it is it would require such a small capital investment again youre the expert here you dont happen to remember the plan i outlined to you the day i set fire to your off uh the day i was promoted okay sid like i said youre the expert but that reminds me mr mu uh sid i never did give you that oh my god sir sir my leg is on fire but sir oh my god sir oh my god sir oh my god sir but but sir sir they voted me most likely to succeed no sir at the muncie college of business administration well i made the deans list well im a college graduate you know for kids which is perfect for hudsucker not that i claim to be any great genius like they say inspiration is 99 percent perspiration and in my case id say its at least twice that but i got ta tell ya mr mussburger sir this sweet baby you i i we are a pair and thats what counts your melancholy eyes you made me see their failings louis you made me look at them with your eyes i knew i rescued you didnt i from the terrible dawn no louis i swear i did not louis they can not be brought back there are some things that are impossible even for me i couldnt prevent it louis i cant save her i will only risk losing you i cant save her follow me that way through my cell yes i knew him knew him well enough not to mourn his passing a vampire with a human soul an immortal with a mortals passion you are beautiful my friend lestat must have wept when he made you are these not the answers you came for like moths around the candle of the age decadent useless they cant reflect anything but you do you reflect its broken heart how he must have loved you you would never give up life if the world were reduced to one empty cell on fragile candle you stay alive and study it you see too clearly you see too much but you asked the wrong questions do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality how quickly they perish of their own will so soon without any of those answers you so longed for its already begun if you want to save her send her away did you kill this vampire who made you both is that why you wont say his name santiago thinks you did i could give you reasons her silence her youth its forbidden to make so young so helpless that can not survive on its own she is if you say so you are innocent your lover i was waiting for you knew you mean he is the one who made you should have told you this the one who left the old world for the new you fell too much so much you make me feel none that ive ever known i know nothing of god or the devil i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul and as far as i know after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world i have not spoken to him and perhaps this is the only real evil left perhaps i understand i saw you in the theatre your suffering your sympathy for that girl i saw you with the boy you die when you kill you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing but does that make you evil or since you comprehend what you call goodness does it not make you good no that is a picture nothing more surely you know the one who made you nothing if not vampires ah you have questions if there were a leader i would be the one you dont want to answer two vampires from the new world come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away but how did you come into existence disappointing isnt it to come so far and find so little jaded ingenues amusing themselves with make believe they did but too fast for you to see them no magic just grace and speed yes and very beautifullouis put me in my coffin laudanum absinthe you gave then absinthe we forgive each other then oh claudia youve outdone yourself where did you find them then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess stop pestering me then what plans not you my dear youre spoilt because youre an only child you need a brother or i do im weary of you both yes and ill tell you something else ive met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you what is it now you irritate me your very presence irritates me be glad i made you what you are youd be dead not if i hadnt stop her louis it will grow back again what you are you would be something other than you are but youre the fairest by far some of these are so old and tattered you should throw them away i didnt realise what night what do you mean yes you are my dearest you are mine and louis daughter you see louis was going to leave us he was going to go away but now hes not hes going to stay and make you happy its bet in the beginning lest the death takes you down with it yes thats it my child my beloved child yes cherie of course you want more and ill show you how to get it you drink from morals my beauty but from me never again and the more you tried the more i wanted you a vampire with your beautiful suffering human heart and how you suffered i need your forgiveness louis i tried to tell you louis that night in paris when i first came to you noone can refuse the dark gift louis not even you you remember how i was louis the vampire lestat if you stayed with me louis i could venture out little by little become the old lestat you know i love the dark but theres no dark anymore i cant bear it louis the machines out there that fly and that roar and such lights they make the night brighter than the day youve come back to me louis youve come again to me still beautiful louis you always were the strong one yes past she should never have been one of us i didnt mean to let them do it that santiago he tricked me im so glad youre here louis ive dreamed of your coming youll come home with me louis fro a little while until i am myself again no you come back to me louis louis louis i gave you the gift help me claudia claudia will you never learn who will we get now to finish your dress a little practicality cherie shhhh do you want to frighten our little daughter your mamas left you with us she wants you to be happy thats enough cherie stop before the heart stops claudia claudia listen to me youre ill my precious and im going to give you what you need to get well dont worry louis youre conscience is clear you left her alive you remember how you wanted her the taste of her you need company louis more congenial than mine shes here your wounded one ah but we have even more in common with our creator come i am like a mother tonight i want a child evil is a point of view god kills indiscriminately and so shall we for no creatures under god are as we are none so like him as ourselves that and more do what it is in your nature to do and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms pain is terrible for you you feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire you dont want it to go on in the old world they called it the dark gift louis and i gave it to you then you kill her unless i make her one of us you finish her if you feel so much i like to do it i enjoy it take you aesthetes taste to purer things kill them swiftly if you will but do it for now doubt you are a killer louis ah i know let her alone vampires are killers predators whos all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment dont you understand louis that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of god what do you imagine you are louis what no flowery speeches about what a monster i am what a vulgar fiend and what if there is no hell or they dont want us there ever think of that where do you think my idiot friend were in a nice filthy cemetery does this make you happy is this fitting and proper enough you fool what have you done respect me a little then im the only life you know come the new orleans then theres an opera on tonight a real french opera we can dine in splendour i learnt absolutely nothing i wasnt give a choice remember as did the one who made me consider yourself lucky in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons here all one needs is a pair of fangs i dont know any hell the dark gift is different for each of us but one thing is true of everyone we grow stronger as we go along read her thoughts the trick is not to think about it see that one the widow st clair she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband shes perfect for you go ahead of course not its so easy you almost feel sorry for them anything is possible but just try it for a week come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport yes and im bored with this prattle theres nothing in the world now that doesnt hold some i know it gets cold so fast youll get used to killing just forget about that mortal coil youll become accustomed to things all too quickly the sun will destroy the blood ive given you every tissue every vein the fire in this lantern could do that too you must get into it its the only safe place for you when the light comes give it time youre like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain it will pass and we must sleep now i can feel the sun approaching yes thats you my handsome friend and youll look that way till the stars fall from heaven youve killed louis and enjoyed it you have fed you were made for this forget the crucifix take him take him come youre going

claudia is dear to me my daughter listen to me he knew nothing he just didnt care my god so its as i always feared nothing leading to nothing and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil then god does not exist then there is nothing you mean we are not children of satan but the one who made him who made the one who made him the source of all this evil who made us what we are what are we so you have the answers are you the leader of tis group we had feared we were the only ones your lips they didnt move monstrous what died tonight inside that room was not that woman it will take

shadow of killing yes yes still my beautiful child not yet it cant be the workmen must have a trunk dont stop cherie hush claudia hush now my dear and you never cried i cant go away from me then maybe so do we every night of our lives he was my brother my maker he gave me this life whatever it is and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing and it goes back nothing proceeding from nothing until there is nothing and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge dont mock claudia hes dead claudia dead lestat oh god forgive us hell never let us go i took your life he gave you another one and he found me with you i ran sickened at what id done then he cut his wrist and fed you from him i tried to stop him but you were a vampire then

instrument of satan you are the devil you are the instrument of satan lestat what do you mean i didnt want to kill her lestat what are you saying is god merciless greedy and cruel oh god lestat i felt peace i felt an end to the craving no my god to think you are all i have to learn from no lestat finish this why do you do this lestat the girl lestat lestat shes alive i dont pretend to know im not interested in you you disgust me im interested in my own nature and know i cant trust you to tell me the truth about me we belong in hell where are we what you wouldnt do its almost sunrise it will be the sun or the fire you said they can kill me the sun or the fire i respect life dont you see for each and every human life i have respect they know about us they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses but you must know something about the meaning of it all you must know where we come from why we tell me about him you must have lernt something from him it had to happen for you as it did for me paris you came from paris what have you done to me youve condemned me to hell i cant but how do you know have you ever been caught but we can live without taking human life its possible fascination we can live like this off the blood of animals do you think so and if i dont it cant be dear god what have i done what have i done the crucifix i want a woman dying sure yes yes kill me kill me like you promised but why do you want me i cant go through with it i tell you youre the devil arent you thats who you are kill me if you will but i cant do this i cant do it how do you mean start i want it give it to me no diane what do you want from me why should i be who the hell are you what are you doing in my house yes then my luck would have changed dont say anymore the reels are still turning i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what ive said dear god ive failed again havent i is this what you want you ask me for this after all ive told you its over im telling you but it has there is no more to tell he hadnt even been there and all those years i thought he was dead fictions my friend the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman so we repaired to paris peasant rumours superstitions about garlic crosses stakes in the hear all that how do you say again bull shit but one of our kind not a whisper he was dead to us we were free that was all that mattered where would she have gone she was a child and beautiful heartbreaking merciless child and i had made her that how could i not she had to know perhaps he knew me he knew i would love her more than the waking world but there was more to it than that perhaps in the end he did it to show me that he could for he lavished affection on her there was no doubt about that life was very different with madame claudia as you can imagine shall we go on i was human then might as well ask can an angel feel love both are blesses or cursed with a certain detachment though whether angels take as long to learn it as i i will never know can a vampire feel love coffins coffins unfortunately are a necessity the same as you would say today bull shit nonsense my friend i can look on anything i like and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes oh that rumour about crosses but times were different then i was a man at that age the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans why should i lie 1791 was the year it happened i was twentyfour younger than you are now what can i do to put you at ease shall we begin like david copperfield i am born i grow up or shall we begin when i was born to darkness as i call it thats really where we should start dont you think the same way you do it a series of simple gestures only i moved too fast for you to see im flesh and blood you see but not human i havent been human for two hundred years we love it i only wanted to prepare you we cant begin this way let me turn on the light yes but you neednt worry about that now things change perhaps lucky for both of us absolutely i was watching you watching me i was waiting for you in that alleyway and then you began to speak im a vampire its just a room you followed me here didnt you youd have to have a lot of tape for my story ive had a very unusual life so you want me to tell you the story of my life look at the gaslight dont tke your eyes off it you will be drained to the point of death but you must stay alive do you hear me and the child who did die what do you think she is madeleine a doll and you know what you ask for you promise to care for her then you havent the vaguest conception under god of what you askno if i could see what youve seen feel what youve felt i wouldnt let it end like this you need a like to the world out there a connection then it wont end like this you need a new passion louis a new reason to feel what a story youve told you dont understand yourself but you talk about passion about longing about things ill never know in my life its still inside you in every syllable you speak and then you tell me it ends like that just empty no it cant end like that lestat escaped the fire no vampires in transylvania no count dracula you found nothing did he die in the fire and did you lose her did she go but why did you tell her he did it to make you stay with him you loved your wife surely you loved yvette what about coffins the story about stakes through the heart you cant look at them you said the slave had a crucifix yes youre not lying to me are you how did you do that but i thought vampires didnt like the light you believe this dont you

chicago and uhhnice hair nothing nothing at allthank you grace there is one other thing that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife am i correct on that point point of fact werent tims hands registered as lethal weapons so i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee arguably the greatest martial artist of all times developed for nine years that would be a fella who could defend himself would you describe tim that way grace now while i freely admit total ignorance on the subject i have heard of bruce lee and i was under the impression that bruce lee was one of the if not the greatest fighter in the history of martial arts jeet kune donow i did some research on that form of fighting and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee did you know that is that a fact well then grace could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that tim was schooled in what was the color of tims belt when you study the martial arts they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level youre at in your training am i correct on that point more or less no but that dont mean much i was a completely different person ten years ago lets give key lime a day in court and a large glass of milk i havent had a key lime pie in ten years which do you recommend what kind of pies do you have i

its not that easy wayne donuts and a smoke only get you so far youre gon na have to do your job youll never understand me and you wayne were not even the same species i used to be youthen i evolved from where youre standing youre a man from where im standing youre a ape im hereim right here and youyoure somewhere else man you say why i say why not thats only part of it i mean its a big big big part but its only the chorus its not the whole song was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie yeah it was do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue was what worth it of course i miss mallory shes my wife i havent seen her in a long time what a stupid question what i did for fun for starters well something i used to doalways was a lot of fun no scratch that let me think of something else in fact why dont we come back to that question ask me something else much obliged what do i do for fun do you want to know what i do for fun or what i did for fun aside from the obvious lets do it dont worry about it lets discuss it when im unbound okay now before we get started here theres a few things we have to get clear about im keen with anticipation she sings what does she sing she doesnt talk have you talked to mallory about this yeah its pretty hard to beat the king how bout manson goodyuppie piece of shit how bout ted bundy ever do one on him whose ratings were higher did you ever do one on wayne gacy everybody knows who you are youre famoushow do you intend to disappear youre probably the most famous couple in america try to keep it to a minimum did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room what did you think then mallory what did you think of mickeys plan did you think it would work i take it by your answer it was a whole new team were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to reexamine them who is we when they were found competent before they had already killed fifty people other than the fact theyre a disciplinary problem which frankly shouldnt surprise anyone i still dont see where this situation is any different then it was before so i ask you again mr mcclusky whats changed mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial im confused whats changed why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum and who made the decision no wait you cant kill me mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale dont touch those triggers please i think ive already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a deadway gayle i was your passport out of jail not duncan homolka but me ill be your passport outta developed between the three of us were kindda in this together dont ya think just wait one fucking minute so what now without any further ado mickey and mallory got it yes are you kidding the golden globe the edward r murrow award on average forty million well all be killed this is crazy you cant escape like this mickey can i talk to you alone out front yeah we have a van let me check on scott hes hurt bad sure could i get a coke for mickey okay lets cut it says the united states of america well riddle me this batman how do you feel about the fact that youre never gon na see mallory again dont play dumb with me mickey you know what i mean describe mallory whats up here whats in here describe mallory okayokayill buy that well move on and come back later tell me about the purity you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie i dont understand whats so pure about fortyeight dead bodies please explain to me mickey wheres the purity that you couldnt live without in five year old danny millhouses blown off head wheres the purity in fortyeight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and mallory whats so fucking pure about that excuse me did you say an instant of purity what was the instant of purity the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail no mickey i cant let you get away with that shit answer the question was it worth it you havent seen heard or smelled mallory in a year was it worth it was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life then was it worth it do you miss mallory what oh aaahhh what you did for fun for starters so mickey tell us what you do for fun were about ready to go here are you ready sorry about that all right mickey mickey how do you feel about cross examining grace mulberry songs hes a rebel leader of the pack town without pity that dusty springfield song i only want to be with you thats what i hear anyway her behaviour was the main thing the doctors report used against you so even if she would see me which she wont i couldnt put her on camera anyway if i ask her mallory are you insane and she starts singing dead skunk in the middle of the road that blows our whole case not to anybody she sings she wont even see me mickey now youre not supposed to know anything about whats going on with her but im gon na tell ya somethin since you twove been sentenced mallory hasnt spoken one word my problem mickey is that you dont exactly inspire empathy im all alone on this i need your help i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue and im tellin ya mickey he looks bad the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wont talk to us which always looks bad i have an interview with both the judge of your trial bert steinsma and the psychologist and author emil reinghold both of which discount the notion that youre insane you put that all together and what the state is doing becomes obvious but the network isnt satisfied they feel the show needs another element it needs you in order to put the show on the air i need to get an interview with you you havent talked to the press since your trial now a few days before you get transferred to an asylum you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle were talkin a media event here every son of a bitch out the with a tv sets gon na tune in to see that well make their motives so blatant well shame em into dropping the whole thing at least for a little while the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies well whatta ya say weve been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time and that time has definitely come i feel its apparent to anyone whos hip to whats going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution

to devalue your victory but i just want you to know i wasnt trying to win youre a bad loser chess chess is often used as well in the same fashion as chess i was trying to educate you squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination with which of the following figures do you most closely identify joan of arc eva braun or marilyn monroe or maybe just phone out for a pizza id like to ask you about your hobbies whats his name well ive got this story its really good im working on that is good i feel it could be big it this eh and its you know its incredible am i

you recording it is this being recorded nothing we thought you were someone else so tell me cameron what on earth just tell me because i want to know what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you spacious quiet bright well appointed all that sort of stuff all that crap yes it is isnt it we alllike it and the rooms nice too dont you think and you like it good well youve seen the flat well cameron are you comfortable what let him go let him take it all no dont worry about it id do exactly the same but i dont think im his type the perfect couple i should say thats what i thought he said of course but i think youll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed i dont know i thought maybe i was are you all right what everything except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place ok thats important to me i need to die misunderstood and if it sounds like im being killed youll phone the police youll tell them everything youll wait in the hall no im not frightened a little terrified maybe did you see what happened to the last two who tried that they went up alive and they came down dead the difference i mean alive dead dead alive that sort of thing it wasnt difficult to spot he killed them both he cut them up i refuse no definitely not and thats that i refuse to discuss it further well im not expecting anyone either oh expecting anyone now you thought of that not me we could put it somewhere he isnt safe up there if you really cared about him youd use your influence to get him down then hed be safe he wont do anything for me but for you exactly now ive been thinking later but first him we have to talk boy am i glad to see you looking after it hes probably fucking well eating it yeah hes got to go to work hasnt he you think hell come down for that he cant stay up there because thats no good remember we did what we did we took the money it was a material calculation but whats the use if its underground or in some funny bank in some funny place if you cant spend it if you cant have it what use is it none its nothing all for nothing if you do that i didnt get into this for nothing so that i could have nothing you know were right once its spent you wont have to worry about it you know you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it thats my advice it

there its cameron its not for me its for love and happiness forever love and happiness for ever i want my money back excuse me i dont know why we couldnt stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being we could have hid it in the fridge yeah we dont want another stiff on our hands dont fall through the ceiling ok is he listening to me david whoever draws the short straw does it all that way you either do it or you dont all or nothing and now you tell me but youre a doctor you kill people every day i thought we all were is that all what old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story be rational please and failing that be quiet its not every day i find a story in my own flat why not whats wrong juliet arent you curious dont you wonder what he died from dont look im just looking what whats wrong i wonder how he killed himself i presume that thats what happened what do you think i wonder how he did it all right no problem now you want me to kick it open so hugo hugo sorry about this but can you open the door its us hugo your flatmates and companions your newfound friends hes not in hes left and well probably never see him again i will

guy writes to you is the same they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography i dream of your thighs the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire while i aroused and inflamed i dont know he sounded swedish do you know any swedish men maybe it was just the emotion has he tried down the back of the fridge i mean thats where i normally find things id be the first topoint that out in all kindness i would but like they say you know shes got to want to change hasnt she well she had problems no be someone else like him one is enough and what happened to that girl that friend of yours the one that came round i liked her i really felt we had something she could have moved in we had chemistry for my life at a discussion group i think not god you two are sensitive all im doing is implying some sort of sordid ugly sexual liason why id be proud of that sort of thing yeah he had one too many of thise urges you of all people should know that did you know and when did anyone last say to you these exact words you are the sunshine of my life when you get up in the morning how do you decide what shade of black to wear when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands do you then summon hellfire really cameron can you afford this place well thats what i said isnt it its ok theres no problem what was i trying to say oh yes i think we think or at

wrong with the sugar there isnt that much you didnt even taste it whats wrong dont you like my tea what was i supposed to do first finish your tea ellen would you like a cup theres plenty in the pot yes i suppose so i thought we had a relationship built on trust and you just slap me in the face weve got nothing to talk about out i may be some time but ellen i told you i have stopped yes open it i am ashamed of what i have done ellen when i read what you had written it made me think look into myself i havent dared look into myself for a long time i have stopped ellen i cant carry on i wont carry on all i want is to start a new life i want a second chanceyou are good to me you dont condescend youre intelligent and very beautiful whats wrong demons this wouldnt have been possible without you you have given me incentive ellen i can see clearer now i know this sounds insane ellen but telling you all of this writing the book it feels good dont get me wrong i feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders when i tell you what i have done i cant believe it is meyet i know it was this is like a purging for me i want it to stop it all to stop it was wrong all my life i have been cheated cheated of anything good i shouldnt have been born i was a mistake my natural mother was a whore that makes me stephanie loved me she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me she was just old enough we had a ball for years we could do anything anywhere anyhowand we didwe would play games she would be the executioner and i would be the convict she would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me my sister my adopted sister noi didnt do iti wish i had but i didnt i was beaten to it stephanie became my mother you think i killed my mother dont you my mother i never knew my real mother i was adopted and how did it feel to be rid of him why not please it would help me tell me how it happened youve killed but youre not a killer you are the first person i have ever told any of this to we are birds of a feather ellenwere in the same league i hated being treated like a failure looked down on my sister used to do that i hated it i should have known when we got married in a registry office of course she wore maroon i just wanted a white wedding i think she thought i was a ticket to the good life i had a good job prospects and she was a slut i didnt know until too late one day i came it seemed like a good idea at the time why did you marry your husband my wife my wife was the only one who really deserved it leslie do this leslie do that leslie its your fault she used to tell me what to wear where to go what to do she mothered me i have something i have to show you why should i feel sorry theyre dead let me ask you why do you wear black ellen carter what are you running from i dont know i dont know i dont want to talk about it you know everyone accuses me of being sick the press the tv but im not you know they are i dont watch it for entertainment every night i dont sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner they all say how could he cut her up she was dead i cant hurt something dead and all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen i couldnt eat one of those burgers you dont know what has gone in them no she didnt because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beastssociety is rotting men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft women are making them soft by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention so she doesnt deserve any more my car i stopped working from my car she could have stopped me you know if she really wanted too that is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast if a dog attacked you you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself why then do people get bitten by dogs savaged why oh anywhere whenever i needed to do you know how easy it is to take them you just pick up a hiker or someone off the streets they believe so easily you know look i have something to show you i would say and that would be it one girl i think her name is debbie she had broken down on the motorway and i offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck she just got in and i drove away when i pulled into the layby and took out my knife she just froze and said what do you want i said you know what i want but she didnt getting rid of the bodies is just as easy the first i cut up put in bags with bricks in and tossed them off eldridge bridge in broad daylight the real problem with my work is the blood there is so much of it and it all spurts out so fast like a fountain it made such a mess of no the police say ive killed fourteen but ive not ive killed many more it amazes me how they just havent found the bodies what is society coming to when people just dont get missed i agree some of them are well hidden i probably couldnt even show you where i put them one girl number eight i think the press called it she wasnt even mine i dont know who did it but i didnt i dont know oh about six years since i graduated im a dentist yes one and a half please if you want any theres some left in the kitchen yes im sorry ellen it says in the contract i can have a lock fitted is there a problem angela im sorry yes two please im sorry i didnt mean to pry its just that i really loved your book the touch tell me ellen carter forgive me for being so pushy but arent you a novelist didnt you write that terrific book the color of fear oh tell me ellen i can call you ellen it doesnt mention females only yes of course yes that would be nice ill call round some time thats good yes come on in i thought it was you how are you oh and not just any novelist a great novelist it was an impressive piece of work ellen

sure that you are alright sugar i shouldnt really im not your surgeon ill be sure to no she isnt in any trouble is she or was it she wished he was dead thats it i believe he left the country with another woman all rather sordid yes
