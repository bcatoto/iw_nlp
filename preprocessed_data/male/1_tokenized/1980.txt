cheques well wishers dont worry these things undoubtedly take time well its up to us then isnt it dont we of course they will theyre reasonable men excellent we shall present them along with the other particulars of the case to the committee i want them to see exactly how horribly his body has been affected you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities no not that way broadneck and the others dont like to deal with patients directly it makes them queasy do you have any photographs of mr merrick you are quite right treves this is an exceptional case and i quite agree that the committee should see mr merrick no you cant you cant begin to know no one can can you imagine what his life has been like treves well done i dont understand im sorry too he simply doesnt belong here hes be much happier somewhere else where he could be constantly looked after believe me frederick its better that it worked out this way good day it was a nice try treves but the man is so obviously mouthing your words oh yes fine fine you know your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing treves but you must remember that this is a hospital and there are many patients here patients who can be made well and you owe them your first consideration just dont become so obsessed old man that you begin to neglect them he neednt i have no desire to cause him any discomfort did you make those inquiries we spoke about speaking is one thing treves but can the man comprehend two oclock then you know treves it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance shall we say two oclock tomorrow afternoon singularly unpleasant chap uh i dont suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your patient mr treves mr treves its out of the question i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do im sorry no treves its out of the question now if it was up to me id say certainly lets meet the fellow by all means im sorry i simply cant speak for the other members of the committee i really dont think thats necessary treves im quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case such as they are a few words i thought he was imbecile good how is the patient have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital i certainly sympathize with your problem treves why dont you try the british home or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him oh is he a friend of yours what are your plans then treves you are aware that the london does not accept incurables the rules are quite clear on that point deformed is that it then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable why isnt he in the general ward then a hospital is no place for secrecy mr treves doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment why wasnt this patient properly admitted and why is he in isolation is he contagious indeed dont be mad this muck can kill you youve acquired a taste for this good morning treves i hope we can talk together again sometime good day it was a great pleasure to meet you mr merrick what is it treves yes of course well its been a pleasure meeting you mr merrick good

when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting when will the heart be aweary of beating and nature die good morning here would you would you like to see my mother friends ah yes friends how nice the children where are your children the children may i see who are they of i love the way youve arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece is that the way its done in most houses its very good im enjoying my visit with you very much its so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home im sorry i made a spectacle of myself ohhh well its a lovely bedroom what do you call that thing above the bed im not used to such kindness from a beautiful woman thank you very much how long will i stay here the hospital this is my new home good evening very well thank you and you oh no do not say that you have been so kind to me i was afraid to say too much people always want me to be quiet you wanted me to speak but i was afraid forgive me you did not ask me but the variety of food here is very pleasing i commend you oh yes it is much better than what i am used to hello my name is john merrick i am very pleased to meet you hello my name is john merrick i am very pleased to meet you righteousness for his namesake the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside still waters he restoreth my soul he guideth me in the paths of righteousness hello my name is john merrick hello my name is john merrick mmmerrick mmmerrick merrick john merrick my name is hello yes yes yyess yyes yyyy yyye yyyessam i a good man or am i a bad man but why did i do it what was this all for so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort or so i could become famous that i am very little different from him oh ive just been thinking about something that man bytes said hmmm you stay with me yes john loves the house ive only got until two oclock tomorrow afternoon when carr gomm meets him somehow between now and then ive got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man why am i fooling myself nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm im sorry i dont know either i just dont know and what qualities are those intelligence or stupidity i dont know i cant explain it if this is an intelligent man trapped in the body of a monster then im under a moral obligation to help free that mind free that spirit as best i can to help him live as full and content a life as possible but if hes an imbecile whos body i cant treat and whos mind i cant touch well then my obligation is discharged they can put him where they will he wont be bothered i wont be bothered and everyones conscience can remain free and untroubled and that is my dilemma what is in his mind he is i mean ive always thought he was i think he must be is he simple or is that just something ive wished upon him to make things simpler for myself well i wasnt sure whether he was parroting me because thats all he was capable of or whether he sensed that thats all i wanted to hear and he was trying to please me i shouldnt be we made great progress today i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases he did rather well too but i had to lead him every step of the way though frankly at times i was unsure of who was leading whom no i think a whiskey yes very well i think are the girls in bed ill join you shortly ill get my bag what is it did you see it yes now i think we really do understand one another so you can beat him so you can starve him a dog in the street would fare better with you you dont own this man all you do is profit from another mans misery i know what youve done to him and hes never going back to that you misunderstood this man suffered a severe fall if you take my meaning hes my patient now and i must do what hes still very sick please come downstairs with me ill explain the situation just a moment how did you get in here everything will be seen to you listen youre not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies hes got the rale hes very weak and i dont know how much damage has been done by his fall now stop wasting time and fetch a cab this man belongs in hospital why is he sitting up like this he needs rest he must have taken quite a fall what happened i intend to what do you mean dont you think this is a bit premature we dont have the backing yet to please do but hes so afraid hes going to be carted off ive promised him that wont happen has the response picked up no we dont their committees have informed me that theyre unwilling to take mr merrick even if they were supplied with funds they dont want him do you think theyll go along with us well yes i could easily arrange yes i think i can not me sir mr merrick he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness tell me john how did you know the rest of the 23rd psalm how did you know the rest i never taught you the rest of it yes im very sorry to have wasted your time sir i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him and what was that john yes i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables im afraid that they werent very encouraging but they said theyd bring it up at their next committee meeting so we should have their answers shortly as i said its only a physical problem but i do feel that mr merrick is very flattered that youre taking the time and trouble to meet him and hes most anxious to make a good impression so he might seem rather nervous its only a physical problem he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth but he can talk and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying just tell me and ill make it clear yes sir wh whatever is most convenient for you sir thank you very much sir shall we say in a few days then then will you meet him as a representative of the committee i dont agree no one can make a reasonable decision about this mans future without at least meeting him no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met well sir perhaps i should explain hes doing very well in fact thats why i came to see you i think that if i were to present mr merrick to the hospital committee then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease but of the man as well if the committee had a chance to speak with him hear him say a few words for himself im sure they would see him as a patient rather than as a violation of the rules ah no sir i had planned to see them in the morning yes sir ill look into that would you like to meet him sir no more of an acquaintance yes im well aware of that but this case is quite exceptional yes sir well sir hes quite seriously deformed and i fear the other patients would find him rather shocking no sir hes got bronchitis and hes been badly beaten dont be frightened he wont hurt you its quite nutritious sir good morning sir hes imbecile no doubt from birth he speaks but its all gibberish no the mans a homeless idiot i pray god hes an idiot i dont know what ive got youll know presently at the meeting of the society but until then i beg of you fox keep it to yourself oh nothing nothing of any great importance abominable things these machines one cant reason with them mmmm hodges pierce come closer mr hill take hold of the rope please its a machine accident i expect youll be seeing a good deal of this how long has this man been here yes yes there is nothing more frustrating nothing that makes a physician feel more useless than standing by watching his patient deteriorate and when that patient is a friend no no theres absolutely nothing i can do and yet not once have any of us heard him complain i fear not mrs kendal even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly as is his pain im very grateful to you mrs kendal this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal john will be very excited john id like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage mrs kendal mrs kendal john merrick goodnight john sleep well no no i wouldnt change a thing no john not one that i can see yes john im glad john goodnight

them in my office youre right mothershead please forgive me of course i appreciate everything youve done for john and im glad that you are concerned about his welfare but im the physician in charge and i must do what i think best im also very late so please forgive me arent you being just a little harsh mothershead you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived now mothershead you have to understand that this is very good for john he relishes contact with people outside the hospital oh well quickly please mothershead im overdue incredible isnt it well i think john has had enough visitors for one day mothershead ive got a lecture at the college ill be back this evening i regret that i must leave you here m lord m lady thank you so much for coming it was an act of the greatest charity im sure that if mr merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee theyd see that hes the exception to their rule now im not expecting miracles im not saying hell be able to read or write but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself im going to arrange things with carr gomm right now that was very good john very good thats all for today we shall do some more tomorrow mothershead weve made tremendous strides today mothershead he listens and repeats with great attention and this certainly isnt easy for him hes had his share of smacks mothershead i expect thats what drives him under the bed we must use patience and understanding with this man no hes very upset about something not quite yet mrs mothershead there seems to be some difficulty this morning yes the workhouse yes yes lets go in yes well i want you to clear up a little mess a breakfast tray was spilt and bring up another breakfast when youve done that you and i

want me to do about it i love it i really do ive never been this happy or comfortable anywhere yeah thats all it is lots of ideas no good ones oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first hmm nice i know it eleven thirty jesus what time is it perfect for a child sure is uhhuh great look im at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through i dont think i can get home before nine or ten hi babe well its very homely id better collect my family first right there no my sons discovered the games room no problem in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat well you can rest assured mr ullman thats not going to happen with me and eg as far as my wife is concerned i am sure shell be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it shes a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict well that is eh quite a story i dont believe they did im intrigued theyll love it not for me five months of peace is just what i want well that just happens to be exactly what im looking for im eh im outlining a new writing project and eh well that sounds fine to me only in a very general way do you mind if i ask why you do that it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic well if you are going to have some i wouldnt mind thanks oh no problem at all i made the trip in three and a half hours nice to meet you mr ullman im jack torrance mr ullmandick can we borrow mrs torrance for a few minutes were on our way through to the basement i promise we wont keep her very long dick if youre ready to do it now i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs torrance the kitchen while i continue on with jack the torrances are going to take care of the overlook for us this winter this is dick halloran our head chef oh dick come on over and say hello to mr and mrs torrance yes very cosy for a family and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in oh oh fine well in view of all the ground that we to cover today i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away oh has your luggage been brought in good glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen is your family having a look around good morning jack i hope you havent been waiting too long put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened well obviously some people can be shut in together over long periods of time the police eh they thought that it was what the oldtimers used to call cabinfever a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are well my predecessor in this job i dont suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job great how about your wife and son how do you think theyll take to it can of itself be a problem thats very good jack because eh for some people eh solitude and isolation physically its not a very demanding job the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh the tremendous sense of isolation the winters can be fantastically cruel and the basic idea is toto cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur and this consists mainly of running the boiler heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs so that the elements cant get a foothold well oh it sure would be lets see where were we yes i was about to explain that eh our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may susie jack just make yourself at home would you like some coffee well thats very good time very good please sit down a minute have any trouble finding us very nice to meet you oh well come on in jack yes yes by five oclock tonight youll never know anybody was ever here yes well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday but the last day is always very hectic everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible howre you getting on hi thank you susie we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably ohwell this is our gold ballroom as a matter of fact we eh brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel this is the staff wing of the hotel none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter all the best people even before anybody knew what a jet set was weve had four presidents who stayed here lots of movie stars yes i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs this is our colorado lounge bill would you have the torrances things brought in their apartment well that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first what time does the plane leave jack is a schoolteacher jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through bill id like you to meet jack torranceshell be fine
