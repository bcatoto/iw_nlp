tinll do lets not be too hasty wheres his boat then wheres his crew he aint gon na be out here by himself thats for damn sure yeah but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gon na dream about whats so great about sweden one minute im minding my own business the next thing i know the whole place is burning up an oxygen tank mustve blown on the welder started an oil fire damn mind of its own fucker yeah a ship thats supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago you dont think thats just a little freaky lem me see what you sure how about now nah everything was cool its just one of those things they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away with that coxswain dickhead ill sleep good tonight knowing that yeah yeah what what say epps you up for some roasted albatross hell no you think im crazy right wednesday then what the hell happened to him i heard a scream when i got there i found him on the floor he was having some kind of seizure i didnt see anybody else a what smokes pretty handy with that scatter gun epps you raised on a farm one guy isnt gon na be so stupid im saying we got ta do whatever we got ta do to preserve our interest fifty million dollars fifty million we gon na let this guy just take it from us one guy gim me a break light in those passages aint so good whatre you crazy i tell you one thing were not gon na be towing no ship now thanks for the warning ow damn last thing we want is extra partners yeah well how the hell you get something like that wrong thats a damn big boat its either sunk or it aint nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either ready then well all be doomed any other questions seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds it aint gon na be what youd call easy any questions somebodys probably looking for her as we speak probably slipped her moorings got tangled up in a current you think thats funny yeah roger maureen what it just occurred to me i dont know your first name all this time and i dont know it what is your first name why not where from right sorry theres a charming thought right i dont figure theres much i want money cant buy that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants turbine chamber on number two mustve blown took out part of the hull you better get down here right now were taking water big time look i didnt touch it alright i didnt touch the fucking radio ever occur to you theres somebody else on that boat skipper i didnt touch the fucking radio what the fuck what take it easy willya what about the radio the radio oh yeah the radio maybe you can tell me then i dont know what youre talking about with all due respect skipper part of that up theres mine id kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it for starters getting that gold off the ship what they dont know about isnt gon na bother them yeah well the truth is one thing when theres more than a few hundred million dollars involved thats a whole new deal well theyre gon na be asking a lot of questions about us about those bodies about the gold seems like we oughta be prepared is all so i got a question just from a you know purely technical standpoint we call the coastguard coastguard shows up what exactly is the plan on a passenger ship in 1953 not me i think you better see this for yourself you better get down here quick skipper im on c deck cabin 400 dodge to murphy right i might be able to find something on the ship but its gon na take time so whoever did this might still be around damn barbaric is what it is fresh aint the first word that comes to mind yeah reconsider fucking his shit up what if that fucker finds it before were ready to go why not why the fuck not i say fuck the motherfucker were a professional salvage crew going about our business whats some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway bullshit that boat hasnt made steam for fifty years we found her shes ours sounds like the hull yeah yeah im buyin me a nice outrigger spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget yeah yeah im on it you got ta be kidding what the hell we need that tub for we got fifty million bucks then were rich were damn filthy stinking rich so whatre we gon na do thats the big question right or somebody stopped them didnt happen yesterday ill tell you that torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat what you think theres something funny about it went aboard man it gives me the creeps we got no business towing a ship that size anyway i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway what do you want me to tell you that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened cant do it skipper three four days i got ta pull the blades and reseat everything in a new rotor its a full 2500 horses down we couldnt drag that boat down hill on ice with it im telling you you dont want to be running that fan like it is hard to say the right way and the wrong way like i always say metals crystallized got ta replace the whole deal turbine rotors shot hard to say i got ta get in there and have a look at least a couple days depending the number one turbines pretty well trashed number two runs but its way underpowered threw a turbine blade mother fucker sounds reasonable its a bloody navigation hazard one boat cant control a ship that size if you get it back in one piece yeah from one side of the harbor to the other but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over smugglers maybe are you kidding me jealous epps gim me a breakafter fifty years there aint nothin left but shoe leather lem me see was that before or after the oil fire maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat i dont know tuesday i aint no mechanic just so you know yeah hell what difference does it make if we report it now or later we call this in now gon na be coastguard fbi who knows who all over the place shes so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and wed never know it well see whos dreamin mman its a beautiful country very clean very civilized and cold looks like it took out the backup genny too morning skipper take it easy dodge its only a piece of metal are you crazy do you realize we got ourselves a ship we own a ship dodge thats what it says sixty pounds you think the extra strain caused it i dont care what aint nobody just gon na let us walk away with a ship that size hypothetically speaking what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back looks like epps gon na get some tonight hear that dodge epps dont think its a problem i didnt sign up to go home empty handed and i sure aint gon na roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this what you okay i dont even want to know what thats gon na taste like now i feel fine lights no stay away or else coffee whatd he look like hell yeah i like it cold colder the better hell yeah two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold then why didnt they take it cargo like this could make a crew think twice hed let you off at the nearest port thats for sure too big more like a freighter i bet you did show your tatoos to that coxswain last night did you epps whats slow fine with me all im saying is that golds worth a lot more to us now than it ever was now hold up just a minute lets be reasonable here what about the gold doesnt look like it much matters cant find the shotgun mustve heard something below deck and went down to check it out were still drifting a what must be a little too the truth eh dodge gettin a little hot under the collar id say we aint exactly in what youd call your high traffic neighborhood either were not gon na be able to pump it i wish i could tell you id be real interested to know myself oh man say what last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera down somewhere in there scavenging around what happened lost my sea legs never been more thirsty in my life maybe eppss mystery man had something to do with it and look what happened holy shit pretty low all around i say we offload some of that gold now supposing he wants to get bad with us i dont know moving to sweden fifty million four ways thats twelve million and change a piece what you gon na do with your share skipper and get a bunch of fools sniffin around here what now i heard that yeah but we still got ta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka so what we gon na unload the gold and get a move on if they thought it was lost at sea they probably just wrote it off ho baby how much you figure thats worth skipper youre up late yeah all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it you mean tow her back thats a thirty thousand ton ship youre talking about murphy goddamit hows that call the coastguard looks like its adrift i been watching it for close to an hour and it hasnt moved i cant raise it on the radio either makes me think it might be in trouble theres a large vessel out about ten miles to the northwest red sky at night sailors delight better than making hamburger for mickey d i must be in the wrong business not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia let the buyer beware the number nine on the starboard sides half flooded epps says its a slow leak just under the waterline about twenty gallons an hour they mustve pumped it before we left sitka greer to murphyroger that north island arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two over and out roger north island please advise pending further information over roger north island i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera and she is afloat repeat she is afloat over north island have you got any additional information over north island please repeat over roger north island arctic warrior over and out passenger vessel chimera i will spell charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha no registry information is available at this time i have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west five seven north at two zero one four hours zulu time over a passenger liner north island over a passenger liner over north island i wish to declare myself salvorinposession under section four two charlie of the international maritime convention dont fall asleep youre late tomorrow well see if we cant find some line and tackle use some of those bodies below decks for bait well stand the watch on deck tonight youre up first then youre a lucky man if money can buy what he wants what the hell happened yeah conveniently enough for you you didnt want us calling anybody too liable to ruin your big payday dont lie to me you smashed it the radio i think you know just what the hell do you think youre doing theres no way were gon na hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here besides itll be safer where it is what do you propose i guess the best strategys just to tell them the truth how do you mean if they knew what they were carrying it was a mans voice repeating some sort of childrens rhyme i dont know it didnt make any sense you didnt hear it what is it murphy do what you need to do just do it fast cant you use something else thatd be my guess could be meant as a warning bodiesre too fresh if hes reasonable maybe we can make some kind of deal if not well have to reconsider our options well stand a watch four on eight off low man first and what do you propose that we knock this guy off not in the eyes of the law if somebodys aboard her already she aint ours shes theirs warm water current maybe making the metal expand dreamins all any of youre gon na be doing if we dont get this boat running how about you epps the sooner we get under way the sooner we are to spending whats ours so we get a little more for the boat besides the goldll be safer where it is it looks like it a salvage claim to a vessels cargos as valid as a claim to the vessel itself its ours either way they mustve had a pretty good reason then it happened before they scuttled her a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard adrift and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it its a hell of a lot of money she take a radio obviously its some kind of screw up the shipping records arent a hundred percent accurate goddamit dodge how long how long then what about running number two by itself we got ta get outa here dodge a storm blows up and were history but how long i know i know two ways to do anything how much longers that gon na take i thought you said it was just a blade whats this how long to fix what is it with a little extra fuel weather permitting we should make sitka in five days without another stop the damn things been floating around for god knows how long and it hasnt hit anything yet so we take it easy a little of the old push pull its a risk im willing to take you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage the fittings alone could go for a few million what the hell would a freighter be doing up here its way out of the lanes theres not a port for 800 miles you arent jealous are you dodge i wish i could believe that either way you know what ive done ive got no choice i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo theres nothing supernatural about greed and thats what it comes down to pure and simple i know a little bit about human nature and what ive seen only confirms that i think i see it pretty well i didnt want it to turn out this way the way i figure it it was them or me i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch bought a little time made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around but its just us on this ship us and your spirit friends it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody you saw it coming as well as i did dodge had his plans starting with scuttling the boat and greer too except he went nuts couldnt take it i guess couldve happened in the middle of downtown anchorage but did it make him any less dangerous i dont think so were in an island chain its only a matter of time before we hit another one we hit land its not the weather im worried about the wrong current could drag us as far as the aleutians before we come across another boat hard to say which is worse staying here or taking our chances in open water crazy with greed not crazy not like him over the gold what do you think leave him till we can get some help from now on nobody comes down here epps you there hes not on deck and i cant raise him on the radio either of you seen dodge murphy to epps why you how come the rest of us havent seen these people whats that supposed to mean that much i think weve already established victims of what maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks showing you what what like some kind of ghost not our mystery guest again i dont know are we never mind before your time i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune equal parts greed and paranoia usually resulting in homicide what happened after that is anybodys guess but judging by our greek friends down below it doesnt look like the last time i guess thats the sixty four thousand dollar question isnt it wish i could say the same hey doesnt matter let em ask this ships legally ours now if it was a ship she hit but wheres the damage collision with what must notve been the captains entry he was probably out of the picture by then february first smashed it up pretty bad somebody took it out of commission last night the ah the radios out if they were close enough to shore they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats possibly false hence the ima record of being lost at sea i dont think mutinys out of the question here no ill try again later hows he doing ill call us in dodge see how many signal flares you can scrounge up keep an eye on him i dont know no not greer somebody just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio you just shoot at something murphy to epps got your light no cowboy shit up there understand dodge get on that turbine i dont care if you dont sleep for a week the sooner youre done the sooner we can get out of here hows the food situation we dont exactly have the best bargaining position you sure it wasnt me are you sure what what the hellre you talking about what guy who take it easy youll live longer for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this maybe but theres always somebody whose interests at stake only way to be i think wed be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current nobody knows thereve been a lot of theories of course but well never really know for sure she was a twomasted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872 one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel the dei gratia as the crew of the dei gratia got closer they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste on boarding they found her completely deserted the captain his wife their daughter and the entire crew all gone the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble the table was even set for dinner and in the nine days after the last entry she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard ever heard of the mary celeste her destination was halifax yeah some charts a crew manifest looks like her last voyage was january 1953 the question is where the hells she been since yeah thanks the laws on our side if they want to challenge it let them try salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks at least who knows could be more could be a lot more what im proposing is we split it four ways candy nobodys going anywhere with that gold now anybody tries to board well know about it you can do what you want greer but neither of us is gon na risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that you think whoever did this is reasonable leave it so whoever did this now has our shotgun he took the shotgun and a light the mooring hasnt come taught government weather its got a transmitter aboard its a noaa buoy shut up the coast guard has our last position theyll send somebody out soon enough a ship this size you cant exactly miss alright everybody grab your gear this is where we get off we heard you scream any idea what you mightve seen dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins youve been out for about a day you dont remember howre you feeling drink up then maybe greek citizen merchant navy obviously we arent the first to come across this ship they probably stumbled across it just like we did couldnt have happened much more than a month ago well have to take it easy then i dont think well find much aboard the ship but its probably worth looking around would you hold on just a minute here please look theres no reason to panic now epps saw somebody fine its a big boat chancesre real good he doesnt even know about the gold if we stay cool nobodyll be the wiser the gold stays where it is til were ready to go like i said itll be a hell of a lot safer there than here lets just take it easy here alright nobodys gon na kill anybody greer not much at all i guess retire live out my golden years and all that we could call for help dodge you got ta get on those repairs its worth the effort believe me besides were gon na need her to prove the salvage we leave it where it is stick to the plan not for fifty million an ocean liner maybe but fifty million in gold they come looking for hard to say maybe forty fifty million guess i mustve fallen back to sleep wheres epps morning some classy tub in its day huh so we cut her loose and wait it out a little weather couldnt be anything she hasnt seen before weve done it before whatever the reason shes adrift and abandoned weve got every right to salvage her sorry besides a little rust everythings pretty wellpreserved its funny steer to one eight five lets check her out too deep to anchor out there alright ill be right up yeah red sky in morning sailor take warning you got that right hell sell the scrap for three times what he paid what do you say dodge of course they did go you got about two seconds to get your paws off me tarzan i heard you but im choosing to ignore you epps lets go as i said what seems to be the trouble what seems to be the trouble ladies youre kidding right fifteen at the most you pump it out and reseam the hull shell be good as new you got a leak in the number nine compartment better late than neverwhat oh jesus shes still alive she died who wanted her little girl back agatha youre never going back there you want to spend the rest of your life in the temple why

me up there hasnt been a murder in six years theres nothing wrong with the system its perfect why dont you cut the cute act danny and tell me exactly what it is youre looking for what does he think of your chosen line of work just a nickname the precogs are pattern recognition filters nothing more theres no question you dont have any maybe you didnt hear me we keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering cops arent allowed inside the temple to hineman it was iris hineman she developed the precogs designed the system and pioneered the interface the precogs dont see what you intend to do only what you will do the fact that you prevented it from happening doesnt change the fact that it was going to happen but it didnt fall you caught it youre certain why did you catch that yes it is they did make yourself comfortable well be back in an hour im sorry danny but ill have to give you the full tour later on just go to the beginning are these all of her previsions i like you wally so im not gon na kick you or hit you with anything but only if you promise to help me wally listen to me she said she spoke to me she was looking right at me nothing she grabbed me and then

what a big boy i love you sean what a big boy how old are you thats great goodbye crow let go of the gun tell me who made you do this tell me who was it set this up what about the picture what the fuck is going on im asking you again who made you do this crow im not gon na kill you who said i would the precogs were wrong no no whereve you got him is he all right tell me you fuck where is he hes alive his name was sean six years ago francis pool do you know who i am six years ago baltimore you grabbed a kid at francis public pool in the west end which one is that how do i even know which one has it ill get eyescanned a dozen times before i get within ten miles of precrime theyll pick me up youre insane or you think i am and then walk out thats all huh just walk right into precrime go into the temple somehow tap into the precogs and then download this minority report where what safe place is that you said theyre destroyed why should i trust you im not gon na kill anybody you want to bring it down i believe in that system insignificant to you maybe but what about those people i put away with alternate futures my god if the country knew there was a chance they might not answer my question did lamar burgess know about the minority report does burgess know about this about the minority report youre saying that ive halod innocent people why jesus christ why didnt i know about this what so you wont help me not if i stay away from him im not a murderer ive never even met the man im supposed to kill you say some of the children died and how did lamar become involved youre talking about the precogs heal who you dont seem all that proud whats so funny you can tell me how someone could fake a prevision im not a killer the what im a little dizzyno doubt people want to believe in the system thats the beauty of it john you cant run john please listen to me john just tell me whos leo crow were years from that john im asking you please come in well shut down the system until we get this thing figured out how could witwer have accessed the case file then come to my house well talk all right john just take a breath lets think about this and who the hell is that stop just wait whos the victim justice already knows talk to me john tell me whats happening no hows an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them you understand john that the minute precrime goes national theyre going to take it away from us what if danny witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run in the middle of the night i hear youve been spending a lot of time in the sprawl shes worried about you and quite frankly so am i lara called me hes not hes looking for a flaw in us john so give him a tour he doesnt know enough to ask the right questions and you say the third prevision was what a little fuzzy or something tuck in your shirt you can let him look around answer his questions but watch him if theres any problems make sure we know about it first i need you to do two things for me one watch danny witwer you understand that a week from now people are going to vote on whether or not what weve been doing down here has been some nobleminded enterprise or a chance to change the way this country fights crime dont apologize john and this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it has the observer from justice shown up yet which makes this the worst possible time to show that were only human the nation votes this week tell me not to worry john all right tell you what ill do first thing monday ill look over the witwer evidence and ill have gideon run the containment files see if anyone drowned a woman named what did you say her name was but i also know why he married you youre as stubborn as he is i understand sean we know why john was tagged i dont know who that is who i was but this whole incident with john made me realize the fragility of what weve built here this is johns legacy as much as mine and i want to protect that its insanity around here i havent worn this damn thing in years i just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight this is all my fault thank you this is burgess how did you get this my god ill be right there not now tell him not now nothing no footsteps coming up the stairs no hovercraft out the window no clickity click of little spyders no one crashing through that door and do you know why i dont hear any of those things danny because right now the precogs cant see shhh you know what i hear yes we teach the techs to identify them and disregard yes its called an echo the act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the precogs how danny tell me what youre thinking i know he came to me told me about the missing data stream he was concerned that you might find it i dont understand its the same prevision he told me about this you got this from containment good god what was that where are you what i dont want john anderton hurt hes my subordinate none of your damn business the man lost a child for christs sake the mets john doesnt think theyve got a deep enough pitching roster this year and im inclined to agreeyoure not gon na kill me kill me if i tell you my family gets nothing fake he gave it to me now shoot me goddammit before i lose my nerve i dont know i never saw his face all i know is the next day i was out so the guy mustve had juice somewhere look man you got ta go through with this look believe me i know its hard but you got ta do it look ive put my family through enough misery you got ta kill me this way i can leave em something youre supposed to kill me he said you would if you dont kill me my family gets nothing but you have to they said you would youre not gon na kill me it floated back up i had to take him out and i put him in a barrel and sunk him in the bay and that i needed his help it wasnt so bad really i sang him a song made him laugh bought him a pretzel i took care of him i made him happy some somebodys father did i i dont recall i got lots of kids from that place you dont have to do this chief dont run chief you know well catch you you trained us victims are pronounced here killers here we never touch anything what hes doing now we call scrubbing the image looking for clues as to where the murders going to happen uh sir i wrote it down in your calendar then left a message at your house chief the investigator from the fed is here seventeen minutes how many i was a treasury agent for eight years why they could have been put away anderton could have found them i dont know why he cant download her without a lot of technical help we can stop him two no offense sir but why wouldnt he just run theyre everywhere heres where were at three men in a room the victims here anderton here and this unidentified male out the window the exterior of the adjacent building suggests public housing but i cant make out the location government architecture is modernconformist which means sir the teams gon na be light without those men what dont worry ill bring him in unharmed because of the nature of murder theres nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us than the untimely murder of one human being by another the information we need is embedded in the grain of wood and since each piece is unique the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate crime of passion no premeditation they show up late most of our scrambles are flash events like this one we rarely see anything with premeditation anymore thats the red ball alarm not after the vote next week once the amendment passes we go national theres gon na be nowhere to run this is evanna the team pilot john anderton was my friend why dont i feel like celebrating knott i think youre swell company knottsure chief i think ill grab one for myself while im at it any id on the shooter yet that was easy ive got no address last known or otherwise no tax returns for the last five years the victims name is leo crow nope somebodys thinking about this one were in motion on something sir come on chief you think about it the way we work changing destiny and all were more like clergy than cops what go ahead yeah so the mall somewhere near the capital from solar position trig image confirms it at approximately eight ohfour am got him in the foxhall 4421 gainsborough we cant grab it we need confirmation on the time frame location still uncertain remote witnesses are hooked in red ball double homicide one male one female killers male white 40shold your breath dad im your son im you goodbye dad i know that i know you would have done anything to find me i know you would have died for me the more you want to believe something the easier it is to be fooled once i even told him i loved him i feel bad about that i need you to forgive me the funny thing is i started to believe he really was my dad no he got tired of pretending i lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father he took me all over the world wan na hear something funny you got ta have faith dad come on okay now let me time you i love you too i love you daddy love ya dad i won i scored a goalpossession alone will cost you six months not to mention your badge it seems ive found a flaw john you ill write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night i agree the system is perfect if theres a flaw its human it always is thank you for the tour wally flaws at least now you and i have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesnt happen to anyone ever again i dont know he was shot and killed when i was fourteen on the steps of his church in bethesda sorry old habit i spent three years at fuller seminary before i became a cop my father was a minister lutheran the oracle isnt where the power is anyway the powers always been with the priests even if they had to invent the oracle but you call this room the temple i find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs i have a warrant in my pocket that says different if its a question of authority so ill be the first one to go in then really youve never been inside to them speaking of interfacing id love to say hello then why cant they see rapes or assaults or suicides you ever get any false positives someone intends to kill his boss or his wife but they never go through with it how do the precogs tell the difference yes because it was going to fall but its not the future if you stop it isnt that a fundamental paradox you mind if i tag along as i recall they outlawed compression firearms in the district ten years ago your secretaries were all kind enough to give me a look around the office what of course it would have to be someone with access to the prevision in the first place someone fairly high up so there is a way to fool the system precog deja vu by fooling the system all someone would have to do is wait for precrime to stop the murder from taking place then a few minutes later commit the crime in exactly the same way im thinking someone got away with murder i did find it it was inside of agatha all this time so the question is why would someone want this erased from the data file according to the sentry anderton was watching this at containment right before he was tagged this murder is happening at two different times now the second image watch the water the winds changed the ripples are going the other way not quite yes this is from the twins arthur and dashiel agathas stream was missing now this one is from the cyberparlor anderton downloaded it directly from agatha watch wait just a second i dont wan na say over the phone but i think we may be chasing the wrong man lamar i found something shall we call the attorney general im sure hed be happy to clarify the issue for you oh its all my damn business now lamar investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy hes my suspect six years ago what did you two talk about yesterday afternoon why are you protecting him you knew he was doping yet you did nothing about it he came to see you yesterday right before he got tagged what did you talk about none this was arranged i worked homicide before i went federal this is what we wouldve called an orgy of evidence do you know how many orgies i had as a homicide copy gordon treasury then this would be your first actual murder scene what kind of cop were you before this if you were a child killer you took these pictures would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find there a maid in this hotel no he cant hes trying to prove his innocence shes in the room with him when he kills crow shes already a part of his future it doesnt matter he wins there are two others in the room besides anderton and crow because he thinks hes innocent andertons smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media cant id him to pick his pocket theres fewer consumers down there which means fewer scanners to target him theres thousands of units like this one yes i know actually gordon youre not gon na do that im taking control of the team somehow i dont think that was walt whitman im sure youve all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology people have gotten the message gum cant they shut that off so if you wan na kill someone you take him to miami nice to meet you gum but ive seen the three hundred hours of your image hes got stored away to prevent a murder sooner or later hes going to contact you you know i need to use you lamar burgess thinks that you left john because he lost himself in precrime instead of you not very well im sure id probably start doping myself or maybe id he took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies this is all in your statement lara what was it then you said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself but john was with him at the pool you mean after he lost your son have you been there recently so you havent seen his apartment you ever heard him mention the name leo crow thank you he hasnt tried to contact you hes not here now is he just sugar then you and john ever come here cream and sugar i like it this your work my name is danny witwer im jesus are you telling me they cant see murders anymore wally the other two can still function right but theres still the other two what does he want with a precog tell me how all this works nice to meet you wallyfuck you im gone shes got your gun thats what shes thinking the fuck you had to bring a

we can go nothing nothing yes my friend carlos is doing it who works with me its his its his pudding hes doing it its not mine hes crazy i told him not to do it hes the one whos insane he only spent about one hundred dollars so far though no i didnt say that no yeah you see if you spent 3000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles you see thats whats used to redeem the mileage so in noticing the pudding each cup had an individual bar code in other words two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles add in the coupon its one thousand you see the promotion says buy any 10 healthy choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1000 for purchases made with a special coupon so in the supermarket you notice their products first you notice they have a teriyaki chicken dinner at 179 thats a pretty good dealbut then i noticed they had soup at 89 cents a canand you start to do the math and you start to notice that its a really amazing deal because i stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label thats those little bar codes you know the universal product codes im sorryi lost my thoughts what i was saying so that pudding was bought i bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion thats sponsored by healthy choice and american airlines its designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying healthy choice products they make frozen meals deli meats pasta sauce breads soups and ice creams this sort of thing thats nice its nice ive been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways cross promotional work by some companies do you remember all that pudding did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying

thought of two other birds did the same thing an hour later not as dramatic they lived but you could see they hit something they caught it on tape and theyve been playing it all morning they found the bird his head crushed in when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky they think they have some invisible shield thing going like an optical illusion eleven am theyre gone thats a game isnt it anyway theres been some interesting developments for the kids protection all they were doing was watching tv from five am i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said they should be playing furry furry rabbit or tea party or something right yes can you at least pretend to be like you used to be give me some comfort how can you say that do you think its a possibility i got him thats right its noise pharmacy crowded that roof is over ten feet high this guy got on the roof in like a second it was very dark it was very dark i heard you want him coming in the house next time are you going to do this or what just make noises then you dont mean it its just for show curse and stuff okay this guy is trying to scare us hes messed with our property hes coming around the house its time for an ass whoopin what book dont worry its like war of the worlds youll lose the signal yeahim scared who said i was going to die thats weird dad listen bo this is very important everything people have written about in science books is going to change the history of the worlds future is on the tv right now we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there for your children bo not english though you heard the voices right uncle merrill he licks his butt everyday hes not going to mind its not contaminated its just tap water pour it in his bowl you dont even know what that word means did someone save me i hope theyre doing better than we are we dont even have helmets theyll read our minds dont yell at her french toast and mashed potatoes what about isabelle where are we going to sleep sounds made up they win they said one of two things could happen one they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later yes they would invade us using only ground tactics hand to hand combat they wouldnt use their technology or fight an airborne battle because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them dad dr bimboo one of the authors of the book scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs it says theyre probably very small like my height because as their brains developed there was no use for physical development it says theyre probably vegetarians because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet they tell you everything in this book so the aliens cant read our minds it gets clearer the higher you hold it dont do it we might lose the signal its still making the noises its broken these are ds i need double as it needs batteries can i use bos old baby monitor as a walkietalkie theyll find a way in the book says theyre probably very good problem solvers some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world nothing really bad is going to happen is it uncle merrill they think it might happen all at once they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver dont do it is that himwell why dont you hold these as evidence in the meantime bus broke down sounds familiar youre not going to arrest me for it are you gene think boy that night the night of the fire at the barn you were only six years old its time to make amends its not me thats your grandfather youre talking about i know what people say heard it all my life sure what do you want to know you like it irrigation system your grandaddy built it himself saved the land from dying youll be back old slave superstition you sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops you get yourself a good harvest so they say i wouldnt pay jesse no mind at all shes just a crazy old woman hasnt been right in the head since her husband passed away wasnt much right before that neither you got it wrong boy im not the monster you think was you aint afraid of ghosts now are you that old barn after the fire i rebuilt it nail by nail just the way your granddaddy wouldve wanted it pardon guess it was her time to go you cant argue when the good lord calls you home broke her heart you never visited but i always said youd come back joseph macdonald damn right boy and dont you forget it aint nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years my boy was taken from me far as im concerned hes dead now i aint gon na ask you again who are you depends you got some nerve intruding on a mans grief i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide now who are youchicken blood on the crops superstition lets say today we make it your business what are you talking about meaning howd he know id come i amends who then jeremiah who then who because someone wants another blood harvest with human blood jeremiah just like jethro who did he kill back then jeremiah farmhands transients people no one would miss crazy old macdonald but now its starting again isnt it someones picking up where jethro left off people say he was a murderer thats a good idea maybe we should have a little talk about grandaddy jethro i dont think so blood she was talking about a harvest of blood maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel ill be fine here this is his room isnt it aunt edith how did she die how was she called ill be gone again tomorrow i came back for the funeral thats all joseph macdonald your son im your son and laureens son you know who i am you invited me what are you going to do shoot me is that right how does it feel keith you guys figure it out im taking a break tell me you checked the bus before we left carl try taking a left after the next cow pasture which means weve got one week to start acting like a professional band relax he liked what he saw well some of it enough to give us a showcase audition one week from today never cant help it suze family sticks together the trap door thats how he escaped the fire get out of here dont you see whatevers going on im part of it dont look suzie listen to me no suzie no i hurt my leg diving away from the harvester it almost got me youre not making sense what scarecrow what are wait a minute suzie you wouldnt understand strange i can feel my old self coming back look you want to talk about this picked up one of those shears blades razor sharp where is everyone i heard something came in here last night must have gone to sleep i said thats enough let it go when i was a kid i was never allowed up here this used to be jethros room the attic nah just you still trying to figure it out myself name something my father and i dont exactly see eye to eye nothing to tell picked tonight to come by and watch our set time for a little feedback guys that guy from hectic records a puppet youre not gibarian i can trust rheya can it work what do you want gibarian wheres snow did you call him how quickly you fucking bastard why would you let her to do that shell come back you murdered her you killed her thats fantastic meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants no theres no behavior modification listen they shouldnt let people like you into space her who are you talking about wheres his body i am here to recover this mission report my findings and make a recommendation now what happened to him i want to hear your version what happened to gibarian all right maybe you can jesus when did this happen whats wrong with you we need your help i love her into what her oxygen would have run out yes just get him to stop i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan no she knows everything she knows who she is get out she drank liquid oxygen they come when you sleep human beings can die but why is it doing what its doing given its resources it could have done anything presented me with your double and you with mine ive never heard you express any desire to leave before now why now no consciousness is enough thats all ive saying consciousness should be enough for anybody not necessarily we are not sure of that we are not sure we arent all hallucinating when you cut yourself pounding the door did it hurt is it being deliberately cruel you mean i dont think so why what is it gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed i dont know to who i wish youd told me will she come back rheya my wife and professionally what was it shut up that depends how much sleep tell me i wont think youre insane she was real where did she come from gibarian warned me he left me a message is there anybody else here hell let me in wheres sartorius what how whats wrong what happened to gibarian how can you be here last night you were talking to someone in the corridor where did you go before please dont what does it want a sleeping pill do you want yours i dont know anymore all i see is you it put you here ill admit it it acted like a god and put you here put you into my consciousness i was asleep and it put you into my dream i saw your mouth and there you were whether youve been sent here to make me happy or punish me it doesnt matter the decision we make now is all that matters stay with me you have to remember that i love you thats all that matters i think they help i wish you wouldnt is that really what you want yes i told you it was exactly like mine yes you are who are you then you exist here i keep telling you i want you here then you wont make it i cant stay here i never said i didnt neither did i thank you you should have told me i want every second i can get with you rheya i am not going back im staying here with you no listen i dont care about anything but the fact that you are here you are her you are rheya rheya i dont think it knows its torturing us its just watching that wont happen again were different i love you its all right he is but he was here gibarian he was here do you not this time neither can i not any of it theres no reference point for whats going on its never happened before its a clean break in the fabric of the universe a gap there is nothing to do but experience it momentto moment and not let it destroy us for a reason that neither of us understand you are forced to stay near me thats all i know right now rheya dont debate him hell say anything those are dreams can you sleep no i love you you she said i didnt love her yes especially toward the end im sure there are worse people to talk to but i dont know who they are when when im asleep who have you been talking to what are you talking about stop whats wrong yes yes its a violent response to something we havent figured out dont let the cowardly demeanor fool you he is ruthless unblinking in his prejudice he does have a point thats just not the way id like to see it proven well he doesnt think its god but for different reasons than me hes thinking if i can figure out how to make it stop than i am smarter than it is and therefore it can not be god snow thinks we shouldnt leave until we figure out a way to document it to prove its existence to the planet earth this is hilarious he thinks its god but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home i know im putting that in my next report how could she not be real i can smell her taste her she does exactly what she did its not possible i think so its genetics you know this you know where it comes from there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires i dont know i couldnt understand why you didnt tell me you dont know i did too i know i know we dont have to talk about that what kind of look how old were you whereve you been you were trying to break down the door do you know why as i said it is beyond our comprehension youre talking about a man in a white beard again youre ascribing human characteristics to something that isnt human human beings look for causes and patterns how could we know what solaris is up to if anything the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man even the limits we put on it are human limits it can do this it can do that it designs it creates its something intelligent beyond our comprehension not exactly it exists in a continuum that wasnt proven until ten years ago a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe an infinite number of them in fact it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe space or spacetime it was completely counterintuitive we had to unlearn everything do you remember beethoven the beatles movies books restaurants friends what do you remember all right how about i feel better when you take them youre better when you take them i am please come with me i dont want to do this here lets go home rheya not here stop it and tonight you didnt look very happy poem dylan thomas i thought of it when i saw you on the train and death shall have no dominion rheya yes to calm your anxiety ill be right back why ill just be a minute i need to see snow oh god im awakebut i cant leave with you i wont make it oh right away thats why you never saw me with anyone you shouldve noticed that i miss him though i think i made a mistake i wont be making the trip you do you dont shes willing to give her life youre willing to give yours its touching and magnificent anything you want but this isnt the place for it dont you see no you dont youll see her die thats all theyre mortal despite what she told you she will die then what will you do who are you trying to please yourself her which her this one or that one can you face both we are in a situation that is beyond morality so leave with her youll see the transformation maybe she doesnt need any should we check kelvin shell disintegrate you dont believe me lets radio that shuttle pod you launched better yet lets go get it ive charted its trajectory only take a few hours what do you want to do leave the station with her what plan what do you want she knows everything does she know she came once before and you put her in oh this one you love what about the first one the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space you didnt love her why do you think she hasnt suggested that its the most obvious solution escape she knows she cant leave here what happened thats right and we all have to sleep eventually but they are human they certainly become human with incredible speed first theyre like they were in our memory but then they fill in on their own dna doesnt determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain its not dense enough they build up with experience perhaps it did well i think were reaching the point of diminishing returns here right certainly its learning more about us than well ever learn about it of course when we return well be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth well chalk it up to isolation collective derangement we can liquidate the station take the athena back who are you trying to convince stop equivocating unbelievable how you equivocate you the atheist youre more dogmatic than any holy person ive ever seen this is happening kelvin wake up if god is beyond our comprehension and she is here for reasons that cant be understood isnt god here youre unnerved because youve spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you and suddenly your subconscious is an open book we are for the first time experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own that proves that im just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances just a little strategy session but in person this time can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour kelvin you awake thats ludicrous this is contact we have found god the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth so how will we describe it if we choose to describe it at all an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project we are in little danger of being left alone for long youll need to do something otherwise theyll be sending someone out to recover you what are you going to report back to earth what will you say told you what probably it started about three months ago right after the government sold the expedition we were ready to go home she has materialized from your memory of her what was her name dead im not sure it started with gibarian he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door he covered the video lens obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown i dont know why he didnt tell us he had somebody in there by this time we were getting visitors too he was desperately trying to figure it out day and night who was she personally i think its god at least it fits my definition i told you try to stay calm youre supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch was her breakfast conversation that bad well when you do go to sleep barricade your door how long can you go without sleep how much sleep do you need oh thats a relief who was it why who did you see kelvin if you see anything unusual in his lab he wont let you in i cant talk just now im too tired i love chocolate i realized just yesterday how much i love it i thought maybe if they let you bring personal effects you might have snuck some through because well ive been thinking about it you didnt bring any chocolate did you hes dead you go ahead of what i remember about earth its all one thing now everythings a blur i like distinctions i got rid of him i wanted to see if i wanted to be the only one i wanted to be snow im not snow gibarian was under enormous are the actions of solaris premeditated and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the original the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness its an experiment we want to talk freely he wont he wont do itim always here pete when you won that scholarship i was proud of you no i mean we your aunt may not wantin kids and all i mean we both yeah ya like to do things on your own i been thinkin lately maybe i wasnt the ya know

i hate the platonic idea of you i lovloathe elizabeth allan abhor detest despise i uh huh its too early to be clever good morning liz how is he aunt may what happened its fine tell me what a match made in heaven funny thing happened after my physics class today harry osborn oh not that you promised youd burn it what the hell is that the record no its friday night im a photographer remember ill introduce you i am old enough to when i moved out you swore up and down you wouldnt meddle aunt may youre trespassing theres nothing in there worth stealing yeah a psychiatric hospital listen im serious i mean i suddenly have immense physical power and the ability to crawl up walls hi ive got sort of a hypothetical question do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spiders proportional strength and agility oh yeah thanks ill try thanks i dont think ill be running into him luck the right place at the right time need any more help not a lot i saw inside of the science center what exactly happened caused by doc ocks experiment really professor i actually i got this spider bite an extension on that astronomy paper because uh hi professor whats up why it is a wrestling match or no hello uh mr reiss im im the guy who wrestled hulk hogan the other day the guy in the mask oh i dont know thanks mr reiss butoh that itll come unstuck in a halfhour or so your mouth needs the rest bye fine thank you now repeat after me spiderman is a good guy on the side of right and niceness and cute baby animals and all that would you cool it already relax jameson this is

rest of the way just drop me off here bonkers forgive me if i dont feel too sympathetic right now and blow up the universe just to prove hes right bit egotistical isnt it the usual heredity and environment whats the deal with doc ock imagine how i feel yeah just a lung full of new jersey lucky you showed up when you did explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentaclesindefinitely no i must deactivate you do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship do you know anything about shinzons plans against the federation i know you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship because you are dangerous no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines is that your final answer do you know the name of the captain of this vessel can you remember our father do you know where you are no my name is data i am your brother do you know who i am yes please continue can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you sir sir allow me to go you are needed here we are being hailed captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine we are losing dorsal shields yes sir the rift effects all longrange communications we are passing through the bassen rift the projections will return when we have cleared it i aspire sir to be better than i am the b9 does not nor does shinzon no sir it is not possible the b9 is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced but even if they were he would not be me he would deny a human connection is possible he considers himself entirely reman i do not agree although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual of you at our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes ready captain do you think this is a wise course of action affirmative sir negative sir they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals port thrusters sir would you like me to drive they are trying to override the access codes reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and there is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location yes sir geordi equipped me with the prototype for the emergency transport unit i recommend you use it to return to the enterprise it would appear so aye sir this way he believes he has our communications protocols but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels my mission was a success sir i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation data to captain picard geordi and i have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access and i believe we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record we can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander he fought seventeen major engagements in the war all successful beyond that we know nothing sorry sir he is very observant the final signature is approx imately 300 meters up that incline the closest signature is two kilometers to the west that direction sir to new worlds if i were i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior i would miss you the choices i made have led me here as well this is the only home i have ever known i can not foresee a reason for leaving that is because you have a familiarity with them you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge and this makes you sad and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan sir i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously to happy endings because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle this is not an appropriate time for a conversation you are not looking at your self you are looking at me what is our approximate distance we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten i am not but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions no i do not mind dr soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions what purpose does this serve yes i feel nothing geordi it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual captain picard agrees that the b9 was probably designed with the same selfactualization parameters as myself if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities at present he serves no useful function dr soong created us to become active and useful members of society i do not believe he would have wanted the b9 to live out his life in his present state do you have a name sir isolated pockets of humanoids it appears to be a prewarp civilization at an early stage of industrial development i thought only me myself and lore since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii thank you i would like to pick you up now may i do that the resemblance is striking like me it has been designed with modular power sources it appears to be an armemergency force fields are holding dont give up hope data i know i know youre not capable of hope its possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics it seems to be a redundant memory port maybe its for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload maybe hes not supposed to be like you maybe hes supposed to be just like he is an individual more like you you mean hed have all your memories too you feel comfortable with that i cant believe the captain went along with a memory download well he seems to have the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic develop ment the neural pathways arent nearly as sophisticated id say hes a prototype something dr soong created before data captain i dont recommend transporting that ion storm doesnt look very neighborly it could head this way with out much warning how many of you did dr soong make ill take care of it sir sir were being hailed aye sir sir we wont be able to bring you back its a one way trip captain i dont know if the transporter the targeting sequence should take about four minutes ready sir aye sir sir whats he doing hes getting his cloak back we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes phaser banks are down to four percent its called a cascading bio genic pulse the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship or a planet which is why our initial scans didnt pick it up but hes got it captain theres something else i was reviewing the sensor logs thats what i dont get its mostly basic stellar cartography star charts communications protocols some uplinks from colony tracking stations its not even restricted material its going to take some time to find out the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship then how did a reman get to be praetor i dont get it i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface uncharted well have to get closer for a more detailed scan its very faint but ive isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin systemnot tonight i have work here reminds me of a young doctor i used to know how far weve come let me know if you need anything to seek out new life and new civilizations zephyr cochrans own words when charles darwin set out on the hms beagle on his journey into the unknown he sailed without a single musket im counting on it weve been ordered to head to sector 3274 starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there how long does he have dying but the romulans abandoned the plan can you describe it deanna i wish i could believe that doctor yes i so wanted to believe shinzon but the thalaron radiation cant be explained away whatever hes after its not peace he was a damn fool selfish and ambitious very much in need of seasoning remember him beverly come in understood keep on it i need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat give me options i think a skin cells the more likely of the two when was he created please beverly this is hard enough i notice dr crusher laughing along with the rest of you as most of you know the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise to assume command of starfleet medical again im forced to ask beverly have you considered what youre doing to little ole me ill probably get some old battleaxe of a doctor wholl tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i dont show up for my physical on time negative deanna stand by open a channel divert power and compensate full axis rotation to port fire all ventral phasers commander riker evasive maneuvers its interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography how can you be sure he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin but so much is the same on a biological level he is and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him yes for now we see but through a glass darkly he said hes a mirror how long until we reach the fleet fire were about to find out power up disruptors and fire on my mark well then only one way to go can you open the shuttlebay doors what do you imagine this is while i find that fascinating data we really need that goddamned door open alacrity would be appreciated commander well find a way off together recommendations itll only work for one of us a weapon a bit less florid data good work the download on my way well it seems were truly sailing into the unknown keep at it anything you can give me would be appreciated dismissed data i can see that mister worf accompany data please thank you data lets see what she can do new worlds yes data brave new worlds now you make a toast you never know whats over the horizon data before too long youll be offered a command of your own yes and frankly i envy them as well theyve made important choices theyre going to have great challenges ahead of them new worlds to conquer well i suppose it does a bit im very happy for them of course but im going to miss them the ship will seem incomplete without them will and deanna joining the titan dr crusher going to starfleet medical i understand why it would seem confusing certain human rituals like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time so to happy endings this isnt about me anymore make it so counselor i know how he thinks permission denied if you can possibly endure any more of these assaults i need you at my side now more than ever i i not only know him deanna i am him and he is me how could i not is he sincere about wanting peace im going to miss you as much as we care for him deanna we have to remember that data isnt capable of disappointment youre speaking of emotional investment of course sit down counselor may i have this dance the hell you will you know too much about me as it is now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on betazed the least i could do for you deanna besides you know me im a talking head thank you commander open a channel understood do you have life support when this is over i owe you a drink your timing is impeccable commander number one you have the bridge geordi prepare the shuttle bay for arrivals they dont know our procedures so just open the doors on screen you have the bridge commander use all available power to move away from the scimitar now mister la forge thats an order commander prepare for a sitetosite transport how long until he can fire deanna on my mark geordi put 211 power to the engines take it from life support if you have to everything you can give me weve got him he thinks he knows exactly what im going to do he wants to look me in the eye what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack and thats exactly what hes going to do as i remember thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its bioqenic properties i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting if it happens again we want to be ready what programs were accessed cannon fodder what do we know about the population theories what do we know about the planet just lucky admiral not with the romulans understood new praetor with or without the rest of the fleet admiral janeway good to see you therell be another after me and another after that youll find were a resilient species that will never happen what are you doing to counsellor troi praetor shinzon im pleased to whats this on my way please notify commander riker coordinate our attack with the valdores tactical officer triangulate fire on any shield impacts on screen worf prepare a full phaser spread zero elevation all banks on my mark scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes who was it on screen tactical analysis mister worf no not yet mister worf if you dont mind what sort of signature come now a big strapping fellow like you what are you afraid of wont do what mister worf the honor was mine captain riker when your first officer insists that you cant go on away missions ignore him i promise you in time shell become your home if i could offer you one piece of advice the titans a fine ship will and shes getting a captain worthy of her agreed counselor troi report to the bridge report we can only hope so and the romulans invade his hatred of the federation is apparent he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason he is going after earth can anything be done for him away team transporter room four shes a predator patience diplomacy is a very exacting occupation we can wait counselor its an old psychological strategy number one to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy a coup detat acknowledged ill talk to data captains prerogative will theres no foreseeable danger and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you i appreciate your concern number one but ive been itching to try out the argo where we will all honor the betazoid traditions no cold feet or any other parts of our anatomy now if youll excuse me ill be in the gym i think its worth a look dont worry number one well get you to betazed with time to spare still well on our side i am you can still make a choice make the right one now please but you want to so if i gave you my life what would you do with it would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now or could you change could you try to remember a mothers touch you never felt a fathers words you never heard could you do that the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus wont exterminate the population of an entire planet he is better than that i see more than what you are not so long i know you as well as i know myself shinzon there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be look at me shinzon do you feel the blood pumping inside you your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity youve forgotten its the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because its the very thing that truly defines us to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are you know thats not possible and what of the enterprise why are you here we are im incapable of such an act and so are you think about what youre doing shinzon are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons if your issues are with me this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation i wont defend my life to you i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is youre not reman whats this all about all of this so you could capture me what are you doing why am i here in time if theres one ideal the federation holds most dear its that all men all races can be united from the first time the vulcans came to earth weve sought a future of peace nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend ship in time when trust has been earned shinzon im trying to believe you with a full head of hair so im not as tall as you expected after you praetor new worlds yes no i was the first picard to leave earth it caused quite a stir in fact but i had spent my whole life theres so much and so much of it is dull and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons ibility in representing the federation i cant let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions i have no reason to youre doing this to liberate the remans how did you end up on remus yes the eyes have it not quite i envy the hair line youll acquire a taste for it what happened you know i need to verify this we need to talk just you and i you know i do yes yes and the senate supports you i would be interested to know what we are talking about praetor shinzon were not here to discuss your lack of a social life praetor weve come to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation i suggest you do so now praetor and youre not as we imagined you praetor shinzonbut praetor you wont survive without him what about picard disruptors are offline sir two ships decloaking sir romulan praetor weve received the transponder signalserving with you has been an honor i intend to anything but shes not the enterprise shes the most beautiful ship ive ever seen unless we can disable his cloak were just going to be firing in the dark hes firing through his cloak we cant get a lock strength in numbers oh boy destroy humanity and the federation is crippled sir he wasnt designed to live a complete human life span not very chatty shes not out for a pleasure cruise captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols the federation councils not sitting out here we are its working why dont they answer our hails the praetors power has always been the romulan fleet they must be behind him we have to assume he had romulan collaborators captain you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command sir captain i hope i dont have to remind you thank you sir diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone lets go believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived defensive pattern kirk epsilon geordi get those shields online my god runs in the family so theyve got him up and running well that sounds relaxing tooi can feel your desire deanna very logical deanna but your heart doesnt constrain itself to mere logic to leave all of this behind and be with me ill always be with you now now and forever can you feel my hands are they real can you feel my lips my loins he can never know you as i know you he can never touch you as i touch you imzadi this is so good deanna troi of betazed empathic and telepathic abilities ships counselor all of this i knew but i didnt know you were so beautiful dont you think its time to surrender ill have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces why should the rest of your crew have to die i hope youre still alive jean luc i have no choices i cant fight what i am its too late thats your life not mine i dont know yes he is what his life has made him childish dreams captain lost in the dilithium mines of remus im what you see now long ago i know youll all gladly die to save your home world i have little interest in your quaint vessel captain if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed to accept your surrender i can clearly destroy you at any time lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship its just the two of us now jean luc as it should be your ship and mine you and me you cant trace my holographic emitters captainn so dont bother and you cant contact starfleet were quite alone i think the facts speak for themselves the same noble picard blood runs in our veins had you lived my life youd be doing exactly as i am look in the mirror and see yourself it amazes me how little you know yourself oh but it does we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone not the romulans and not your mighty federation were a race bred for war for conquest my life is meaningless as long as youre alive what am i while you exist a shadow an enigma i see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do i see the man i will never be and im not quite human so what am i what do you see do you see a life you might have led lost youth never to be recaptured its about destiny picard about a reman outcast who maybe ill train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does or maybe ill snap its ugly head off dont be so vain after we found it we made a few modifications an extra memory port a hidden transponder perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn ive gained access to starfleets communications protocols i now know the location of your entire fleet you may go i need a sample of your blood what do your borg friends say resistance is futile i was lonely hello jean luc in time jean luc im honored to think i might someday speak with such eloquence i know there is that i always hoped i would hit two meters age before rank jean luc and you dreamed about what was up there about looking up at the stars were we always explorers i want to know where i come from the remans gave me a future you can tell me about my past all i have is my personal feelings i wasnt raised with the ideals of the federation but im trying to understand them now to live up to them to live up to you of course you do if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people youd be sitting where i am now at least i hope you would you dont trust me no race should be a slave to another for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sisterplanet but the time has come for us to live as equals they sent me there to die how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines it was i was a slave and a monster the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me but one man took pity on me the man who became my viceroy he taught me how to survive and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself i found my reman brothers they showed me the only kindness i ever knew our eyes reflect our lives dont they yours are so confident a lifetime of violence will do that my nose was broken four times and my jaw but so much is the same the eyes you recognize the eyes its not quite the face you remember romulan ale im surprised i cant stand it as happens so frequently here on romulus a new government came to power they decided to abandon the plan frankly i think they were afraid id be discovered and it would lead to war they werent ready for that and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet toinfluence your command structure it was a bold plan i know come to dinner on romulus tomorrow just the two of us or just the one of us no one knew what to do finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalafts syndrome do you know of it captain then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion computer raise lighting four levels but youre also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore above allyoure trying to decide if you can trust me and youre wondering why the scimitar is so well armed is this the ship of a peacemaker or a predator right now youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true i have dissolved the senate i want to end the centuries of mistrust i want to be your ally not your enemy as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas unity captain tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people federation and romulan human and vulcan and klingon and reman im speaking of the thing that makes us the same we want peace yes im sorry captain theres so much we have to talk about on the world i come from theres no light no sun beauty isnt important i see now theres a world elsewhere i am commander riker may i touch your hair ive never met a human woman no i hope youll forgive the darkness were not comfortable in the light our greater goal is more important brother deploy the weapon kill everything on that ship then set a course for earth target disruptors destroy them report on my way what is it focus on your job full stop and fire you heard me let her pursue drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop how long until we reach the rift how long have the doctors prepare ill be on the bridge do as i tell you find her again my time ill spend it how i choose hes gentler than i thought and he has a sense of humor are we prepared and when i return you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect commander suran the games are over in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair does that satisfy you i thought we discussed patience commander the enterprise is immaterial they wont make it back to federation space now go i have some personal business you must learn patience commander do you know where i learned it in the dilithium mines of remus spend eighteen hours every day under the ash of a romulan guards whip and youll soon understand patience silence romulan i have a purpose you dont have to understand i came this far alone the scimitar will serve my needs none its imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath and join us commanders now whats the disposition of the fleetyes just about here around here well you wanted to see it ill be all right you go back to the village and light the fire so we can find our way home please just listen to me your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt ill find her i think we should go on by ourselves what happened what kind of stories you have books kalen youve got to take me there there might be history records something to help us find where the morlocks took where kalen do you have any idea where they take them how can they just go back to work as if nothing happened im so sorry kalen exactly like you well maybe not as healthy thousands and thousands of people and sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories fraid so just a regular old mud carrier ah no on the towers i had an accident the journey is part of my work i will ill never forget this i dont understand i wont leave you like this vox what can i do tell me what to do vox this has to end this has to end no what do you mean why did they built it whats it all for vox do you know which way machines yes thank you yes but youve done enough thank you for your help i hope someday people read your books again this is the way in oh shut up yes yes my god i saw this kalen hold on a minute what last night im used to that yes youll live like this forever alone you were meant to help to be with people not like this because youll never die we need your help can you show us where they live how have you survived so long but you escaped do you know where they live you know of them please we need your help the morlocks have taken sir have you a name i know you youre an automaton of some sort that what are you 1899 how did you know because i dont think thats going to happen im tired of running i know im a foolish man no no a man can change his history you took her because she helped me so you take their best why i could tell them warm them of whats to come say i just come back again why would you let me go back what it cant all be like this but this is barbaric have you completely lost all sense of no they didnt survive only to be your food you did that and what of the eloi how how do you control the morlocks as slaves created you came underground when the world was ending above and you evolved some into the morlocks and others alexander you have my word shes just a beauty ahhh im afraid ive got a prior commitment i just love mechanical things how do you keep the water temperature stable ive only read about them and the new internals its spectacular why is it breaking up no wait the moons falling out of orbit thats not possible whats happening to the moon i what are

week we will never have had this conversation you wont say that in a week thats absurd i cant leave when im so close i cant do that ill tell you what come by for dinner in a week and ill show you you wouldnt believe me david i appreciate your concern i do but i ask you to have faith in me just for a little while longer im working on something now something extraordinary thats where youre wrong i will change it wasnt it i have a dream almost every night now the lady and the tiger you remember that story in the dream im alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors behind every door save one is a tiger i have to make the decision which door conceals emma and i just stand there looking at the doors you dont know that you couldnt possibly if id only done this or that if id arrived ten minutes earlier or later if wed taken a different path or i hadnt fought the man for the ring you have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night consider every action you made and every one of them wrong i live with it every minute of every day thats because im working you remember that you used to care about your work hiding you care for me and youre concerned and i have to start living my life again i hear it from mrs watchit every day for gods sake david then why are you here im sorry david ive been working perseverance oh do you have a romantic bone in your body thats how i knew we were destined to be together when i met her parents for the first time i came right from class and i was covered in chalk they sniffed and snorted but she just smiled at that moment i just knew how did you know with molly emma actually likes chalk dust says it smells like me nothing in the future well be better but shouldnt it be better shouldnt we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this i dont i want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see look at them philby all alike everyone in an identical bowler hat do you want your students to turn out like them you sound like my father wheres the challenge in that one day hell be discovered by some future archeologists and they wont know what to make of him the thick brow so lacking in imagination the dim little eyes devoid of curiosity god and im running late damned if i can keep her out of my equations i was not the point is i know it will work once the um numbers and such are in order all right all right here everything i dont understand sir thank you my laboratory was about here and the kitchen was over there where that tree is mrs watchit wouldnt allow me in much but yes this is about the kitchen mara what mara mara i could yes i suppose so yes a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship shape good it looks fine we had quite a ride together youve welcomed me into your home into your lives everyone has for the first time in a long time it doesnt hurt quite so much i thank you for that if you only knew yes after her death it was intolerable for me here the future had to be better yes this is where my journey started right here over there was fifth avenue and the plaza hotel was there this is the carriage path were on the carriage path those rocks over there theyre the same this is central park orions belt looking back i suppose it was i didnt quite realize it at the time but oh it was most of the time only to keep warm for illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night oh very learning commerce the arts the whole place was buzzing all the time night and day oh very much i used to work somewhere in that direction i think a huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature it was a great city the greatest city in the world how do you decide what are you or mud carriers most things were very high on purpose i mean why do you do it what purpose does it serve whats it all for what you need is an engineer if you set up a system of pulleys and counterweights some basic block and tackle mechanism you could to this a lot more easily i can see kalens point and this is your work this is magnificent you share dreams thats incredible all of you yes yes mara i had a strange dream last night i was here walking through a forest very much like this and then good night not like this they dont seem so bright with all the city lights i never really noticed them much you can see so many here thank you i will is he all right for a time it was astounding i saw the years spinning by i was in the years spinning by we made such advances i dont understand half of them there was a machine that talked to me and others that flew through the sky we must have been incredible thinkers and artists yes or forward into the future i suppose i really should check on the machine see that it hasnt been damaged why not more than 800000 years allowed me to travel from my time to yours i know its hard to believe but its true you might find the truth rather hard to understand what makes you say that its hard for me to imagine a better place where i come from theres so much frenzy day and night it seems were all running faster and faster all in identical bowler hats your husband is dead his curiosity is amazing some but i mean we arent all so handsome thank you well it seems like a long time but it wasnt really its rather hard to explain yes thatll be all all right mrs watchit you can go tell him to go away here ouch all right wish me luck then if emma turns me down will you marry me whats the matter with what would i do without you mrs watchit dont torture me do you have it do you have it yes sir because its a new way of seeing the world of seeing our place in it my equations are not parlortricks with respect sir would we have the telegraph without fantasy would we have radium and xrays without someone first dreaming we could sir no sir and roosters sir that curriculum is forty years out of date the students today are looking toward the new century they want to be challenged and inspired not spoonfed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times they want to explore because the assigned curriculum is boring well perhaps i have deviated the tiniest bit imagine that exactly correct sir i see you wont even try then its time to change that my god how can you just do nothing theyre your friends your family you all knew mara you ate with her and worked with her your work in the valley what is that for if not to you know thats not true what do you mean we have to go after them find where where do they take them i suppose so im sorry i didnt mean to no i mean someone considerably older your father perhaps yes i hope you wont take this the wrong way but is there someone older i could talk to an elder or patriarch of some kind to live in theres a lot of us beyond the valley oh very different but not entirely i mean we have lots of um trees and such but not everywhere and more roads and buildings i took a different route no well i guess youd call us new yorkers eloi i didbut theres nothing here this is it but youre only a mud carrier no he came back screaming he never talked about it after that i dont think he even got this far i had a friend who came here once sort of a dare about the voice in the darkness about the ghosts no one ever comes here my mother told me stories about it late at night they tell all the children i shouldnt have mentioned it we cant go there the hall of books theres a place that might help we could try going there were not supposed to think about it but i dream about it sometimes what else can they do she didnt want me to be a climber she wanted me to be a planner like her and everyone looks like us dont tell me youre a mud carrier im training to be a high climber what do you do on the towers i figured that what kind of accident now how did you get hurt it must have been hard leaving your work theyre inside theyre here theyre inside the house youll tell me more tomorrow i want to see your home will you take me i am are you a climber what did you do at night i found you i saved your life you were bleeding all over the place how did you get hurtand why not but youve earned a reward for your valor i think you should become youll like it here once you get used to the darkness oh you wont be running for long does this prove something to you have you made some great stand of which im unaware i could have a hundred morlocks here in thirty seconds that was a foolish thing to do its always the tiger for you alexander havent you learned that by now if i can only find the right door the lady or the tiger now will you go after all youve seen after mans entire journey you still believe that she wont remember you none of them will you will be forgotten that is how history works yes initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the eloi but you should be happy for her she wont remember the creature she was she will become when a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool were breeding them for submission soon they will be fully domesticated we have lost the capacity to reproduce but the species must continue alexander yours is a world of brocade and velvet not tooth and claw why would you come back to this to save a few cattle no because the past is immutable frozen dead and you are the past go back to where you came from or die here and who are you alexander who are you to question thousands of years of evolution this is the world now i am fact im afraid your indignation is lost here i have no more human response to the eloi then you would have to a carrot its just how we live now they survived above became what they are as our bodies atrophied our minds compensated we make them see what we wish and centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again we couldnt our adaptation was too successful we survived we endured for this to work the machines and build the tunnels you cant imagine what it was like when it all started we survived for millennia scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails endlessly for generations and we became you wouldnt understand we genetically engineered the morlock class to serve our needs no we created the morlocks well alexander as a fellow scientist i know you have a thousand questions whats your namehis home im glad good night alex all right ill come for dinner and in the meantime youll think about what we discussed i pray to god that in a week youre not here youre dying here dont you see that there are trains leaving grand central every then minutes a dozen liners leaving the harbor get on one of them go to singapore scotland manchuria anywhere just away from here whens the last time you were outside this house or this room why dont you come to our house instead i would what is it alex nothing will ever change what happened but do you find her it wasnt your fault alex i know that what happened to emma will never go away its part of you now and it always will be but you have to learn to live with it i care more about my life and yours you know thats what it is mrs watchit tells me youre here at all hours day and night but you wont listen you wont see me you wont see anyone what would you like me to tell jamie that uncle alex is busy that uncle alex is hiding up there in his laboratory there are some things i need to say to you you may not like hearing them but i dont know if ill ever get another chance its my jamies birthday today your godson hes nine years old at his party he asked me if uncle alex was coming i told him no then he asked me if you didnt like him anymore it hurt me alex very much i came by the house every day after the funeral and then every week then every other month then i stopped coming did you even notice all these clocks how can you constantly be running late shes gotten into your equations alex really good luck tonight shes a fine girl and shes done wonderful things for you no im all bowler hat remember she made the best shepherds pie i ever tasted the most able inventor i know and you cant tie a simple fourin hand how romantic what you may not like it but this is the world we live in alex little grey men with little grey hats i want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge alex this is your first year as an associate professor you might want to play things a little more conservatively you know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers tonights the night somewhere around d2xy something something do you know you were humming yes sir if i might explain sir sir if i may dean fulton i have no doubt of that ill come by in the morning and well arrange it goodnight mrs watchit im glad hes gone maybe hes finally found a place where he can be happy and youve no idea where he went i wonder if that poor girl has any idea what shes in for hello mrs watchit youre looking in the pinkdid you hear me lad and your jewelry too i guess we could consider this your first little bump
