this is the age of ragnarok keitel blacksmith it is good to us yes yes of course the blacksmiths code you just cant make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand you could

were through you know something doctor jones youre absolutely right nazis is that the limit of your vision the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world well theyre welcome but i want the grail itself the cup that gives everlasting life hitler can have the world but he cant take it with him im going to be drinking my own health when hes gone the way of the dodo the grail is mine and youre going to get it for me impossible what do you say jones ready to go down in history didnt i warn you not to trust anybody doctor jones we already have your father is the man whos disappeared weve hit a snag our project leader has vanished along with all his research uh we received a cable from his colleague doctor schneider who has no idea of his whereabouts or whats become of him i want you to pick up the trail where he left off find the man and you will find the grail you could be more right than you know this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knights story it doesnt reveal on location of the grail im afraid but the knight promised that two markers that had been left behind would this tablet is one of those markers it proves the knights story is true but as you pointed out its incomplete now the second marker is entombed with the knights dead brother our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice italy as you can now see doctor jones were about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago were only one step away not supposedly doctor jones let me tell you another bedtime story doctor jones after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade three brothers to be exact just the same an attempt to recover the grail is currently underway hard to resist isnt it the holy grails final resting place described in detail every mans dream including your fathers i believe eternal life doctor jones the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail oh now thats a bedtime story id like to wake up to the holy grail doctor jones the chalice used by christ during the last supper the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper can you translate the inscription that was our assessment as well well like yourself doctor jones i have a passion for antiquities have a look over here this might interest you my name is donovan walter donovangot lost in his own museum huh the name of god the word of god its war what its a rescue old boy come on marcus after you junior ready we named the dog indiana what did you find junior me illumination elsa never really believed in the grail she thought shed found a prize junior give me your other hand i cant hold on but in the latin alphabet jehovah begins with an i penitent penitent the penitent man the penitent only the penitent man will pass only the penitent man will pass junior you call this archaeology now who are all these people what do you think youre doing get down this is intolerable its a new experience for me those people are trying to kill us nice landing more or less son im sorry they got us what happens at eleven oclock i didnt know you could fly a plane i dont know well find out then what are you complaining about look we have work to do when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges first the breath of god only the penitent man will pass second the word of god only in the footsteps of god will he proceed third the path of god only in the leap from the lions head will he prove his worth very well im here now you left just when you were becoming interesting did i ever tell you to eat up go to bed wash your ears do your homework no i respected your privacy and i taught you selfreliance actually i was a wonderful father and do i detect a rebuke hmmm what did we talk about ships that pass in the night well im as human as the next man you know sharing your adventures is an interesting experience when were airborne with germany behind us then ill share that sentiment good what did you get oh yes she did only too well unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her thats for blasphemy the quest for the grail is not archaeology its a race against evil if it is captured by the nazis the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth do you understand me marcus would agree with me yes the only thing that matters is the grail i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldnt have to remember oh yes but i found the clues that will safely take us through in the chronicles of st anselm three devices of such lethal cunning well he who finds the grail must face the final challenge there is more in the diary than just the map my diarys in berlin youre going the wrong way we have to get to berlin stop stop stop what about the boat were not going on the boat the solution presents itself this is intolerable oh what what what and the chair the floors on fire see i ought to tell you something feels like a cigarette lighter what am i looking for you said he had two days start that he would blend in disappear so did i she talks in her sleep umh dont worry he wont oh yeah and whos gon na come to save you junior take it easy why do you think i sent it home in the first place so it wouldnt fall into their hands i should have mailed it to the marx brothers you did you didnt did you you didnt bring it did you they want my diary rats if only i could have been with you you did it alexandretta of course on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire oh junior and his shield the inscription on sir richards shield he was actually there you saw him i knew it and the tomb of sir richard through the library humpf so i was wrong this time but by god i wasnt wrong when i mailed you my diary you obviously got it good point well i am sorry about your head though but i thought you were one of them thank god ill never forgive myself oh it breaks the heart but what are you doing here it is you junior junior then wait count to twenty outits a leap of faith oh god im going after dad marcus get hold of sallah tell him to meet you in iskenderun alexandretta now we know the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins marcus you remember what the grail tablet said across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon but where exactly hows the head dad was onto something here marcus ive seen this window before that doesnt look much like a library i dont know maybe hell know us ah venice call donovan marcus tell him ill take that ticket to venice now do you believe the grail actually exists do you believe marcus its dads grail diary every clue he ever followed every discovery he made a complete record of his search for the holy grail this is his whole life why would he have sent this to me venice italy dad i dont know but whatever it is hes in over his head your treat all my life you know how long ive been looking for that marcus i did it how dare he dear me the man is dense this is a castle isnt it there are tapestries dont take that tone with me my good man now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries im through shooting me wont get you anywhere as what a nazi stooge like you donovan youve got the wrong jones mister donovan why dont you try my father yes thats usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet ive heard this one as well two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france but only one of them made it and before dying of extreme old age he supposedly imparted his tale to a to a franciscan friar i think what good is it this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons pretty vague where do you start looking maybe if the tablet were intact youd have something to go on but the entire top portion is missing an old mans dream the arthur legend ive heard this bedtime story before where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever where did this come from well its sandstone christian symbol early latin text midtwelfth century i should think i know who you are mr donovan your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive elsa elsa dont elsa elsa give me your other hand honey i cant hold you elsa dont cross the seal the knight warned us not to take the grail from here elsa elsa dont move im like a bad penny i always turn up all i have to do is squeeze yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for who gives a damn what you think my father didnt want it incinerated where is it i want it so it did this one i think hes in here dont know think of something what do you know about this place no you like the way i do things knock it off youre not mad at

out of the mouths of babes louis rachel not feeling well ellies a little scared of death and the main reason ellies that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death now you just go ahead and tell me im wrong a man doesnt always know why he does things louis i think i did it because your daughter aint ready for her favorite pet to die she got used to the idea spot lived another four years he died peacefully in the night that second time and i buried him in the pet sematarywhere his bones still lie why then things should be fine well she was a little upset at first and thats why i thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last nightyou did didnt you louis stanny b did for me what i did for you last night louis only i wasnt alone when spot came back spirit of the north country not a good spirit wendigos are great liars and tricksters according to the stories and if one touches you they buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried then something happened half the tribe died in a season the rest moved on they said a wendigo had soured the ground i guess it wouldnt hurt ayuh it was the ragman told me about the placestanley bouchard us kids just called him stanny b he was half micmac himself wouldnt wash why saved a little girl from being unhappythats all drink up louis i most generally dont start before noon but this

micmac indians i brought you here to bury ellens cat this was their burying ground louis this time i mean it almost there louis just dont stop louis you dont ever want to stop down here in little god and you dont ever want to look behind you whatever you hear theres a lot of funny things down this way louis ayuh micmacs used to call it little god swamp youll see before long lets go no you shouldnt

you made going to tell ellie you going to bury him in the pet sematary loved that cat pretty well didnt she im sorry at least it dont look like he suffered well theres a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn louis i think it might be your daughters did you tell me rachel took the kids back to chicago for a few days me neither but i believe in knowing your enemy nonot right out loud their stones speakor their markers even if the marker aint nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a magic marker it speaks aint that so louis ayuhthey get older as you go toward the middle pete lavasseurs dog

please i want to wake up leave me alone its not my fault you died you were as good as dead when they brought you in i want to wake up i want to wake up thats all i im sure i told you last nightthis

thought maybe you did i know you dont approve of the subject being raised good d getting there oh youre welcome only if some thing should go wrong while hes under the gasits a oneinathousand shot but it happensyou explain to her well honeyyou know that and church will be fine i just said according to what mr crandall says the roads a lot more dangerous than the operation church will be just the same wellalmost the sameand we wont have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn orinco trucks jesus rachel whats got into you she was a little overexcited thats all poor kid i think its rather extraordinary my god did you see his shirt well ive got a million questions about the area and i dont have the slightest idea when i saw the house this field was under four feet of snow the movers yesthanks im louis creed jesus the road and buckaroo banzai let her go its coolthere are many things that can exert control over ones life good and bad religion greed philanthropy drugs why im glad you feel that way because i feel that way too do you feel there is more progress to be made do you want to leave therapy that you are under no obligation to me you understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time its possible that graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy andor therapists perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with and he would like to see other people you for instance wallow in their situation just as he does do you think thats possible ann in life one has to be aware of hidden agendas did it occur to you that graham may have his own reasons for not wanting you to be in therapy i thought thats what i did who was it that you talked to what brought this on let me rephrase were you attracted to him did you find him attractive is he still at your house the friend of johns that was staying at your house did you confront john about the visitor no i havent radon leakage so it was recently that you tried this i take it youve never masturbated did you masturbate did you do anything perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched prior to this feeling were you comfortable having physical contact with him when did you begin having this feeling this unexpected visit notwithstanding how are things with john but he asked you to quit your job and you do have housework what upsets you about that are you afraid of his reaction of his finding you silly for thinking of such things if you think about it i think youll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldnt possibly have any control over well last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities and now were talking about your concern over the garbage problem ann do you see a pattern here do you have any idea what triggered this concern no i didnt yes i remember what do you do when these moods overtake youim okay its okay no no ann i cant i cant forget it its not something i can fix its difficult there s something in my mind the way my brain works god ann when youre with another person and youre inside them youre so vulnerable youre revealing so much theres no protection and somebody could say or do something to you while youre in this state of nakedness and they could hurt you without even knowing it in a way that you couldnt even see and you would withdraw to make sure it didnt happen again and im telling you its not any one thing that i can point to and say thats why it doesnt work that way with people who have problems ann its not that neat its not that tidy its not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count things just dont happen that way well what kind of answer are you looking for ann what is it exactly that you want to know jesus christ ann why is anybody anything i think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad and you dont allow for any gray areas and thats what most of us consist of all right all right you want to know you want to know how i feel i feel ashamed is that what you wanted to hear i dont find this turning the tables thing very interesting i cant tell you like this because dont do that all right you want to talk about lies lets talk about lies ann lets talk about lying to yourself you havent been able to sleep with your husband because youre no longer in love with him and maybe you never were you havent been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember as i said i havent decided what to do exactly perhaps i wont do anything i dont know i really would rather not talk about it i dont know possibly yes not entirely i dont know possibly no yes i couldnt face her if i had slept with somebody else ann it could happen to me all over again dont you see i could start to ive told you i cant ann are you asking me hypothetically or are you asking me for real right now thats very flattering i i cant answer that precisely im not in love with you im not planning on it you should be he lied to you so did cynthia no youre not interesting analogy and you feel the same way with john subtlety if you do get out of your marriage will you continue to be inhibited did you confront john with the fact that you knew about him how could i with all these nice people stopping by the fact is that ive lived by myself for so long i cant imagine living with another person its amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by and anyway im asking the questions are you happy now i make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me i loved her for how good she made me feel and i hated her for how good she made me feel and at that time i tended to express my feelings non verbally i couldnt handle anyone having that much control over my emotions yes i did willfully and repeatedly the problem was me i was i was a pathological liar or am i should say lying is like alcoholism one is always recovering no it was wonderful that wasnt the problem her name was elizabeth yes thats correct cant if i cant do it all i dont want to do anything and i cant do it all no no yes i thought i made that clear before when i said i would go down on you about me about who so you do fantasize youre not like your sister you couldnt be like her if you wanted to why are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about do you want me to stop then as far as this taping goes you have nothing to worry about at some level i dont understand your nervousness have you decided to leave john did the person you made love with satisfy you more than your husband did you have sex before you were married absolutely not its a simple question have you ever thought of having making love with someone other than your husband does he go down on you yes do you talk to him you are married correct tell me your name tell me your name it wont are you ready i have money load a new tape turn the camera on thats a good question i want you to be aware of what youre doing and why because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind yes but i sense the element of revenge here do you think thats such a good idea its not my place to tell you these things ann you have to find out by yourself or from john directly you have to trust me on this but even if we had been speaking i wouldnt have told you ann when would i have told you we were not speaking if you recall she said it on her tape yes i know i know maybe you want to go im sorry this came up no not to me for me for the camera mostly sometimes they do things yes like what theyve done what they do what they dont do what they want to do but are afraid to ask for what they wont do even if asked anything i can think of everything about sex yes the interviews are about sex ann because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me no yes because i enjoy interviewing women more than men not really donna was a girl i knew in florida donna oh just a personal project like anyone elses personal project mines just a little more personal its a personal project im working on videotapes not much to see im afraid im sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe nothing i cant finish later ann hello thats correct bit of a dilemma isnt it basically yes well i wasnt always impotent oh see i meant someone youve had sex with thats part of the theory you had sex with you therapist i believe in it for some people i mean for me it was silly i was confused going in so i just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesnt know you intimately hah no im not actually i used to be but the therapist i had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems of course i lied to him constantly so i guess i cant hold him totally responsible youre in therapy they are looking at you ann you are truly breathtaking i dont know if you understand how your appearance can affect people men want to possess you women wish they looked like you and those that dont or cant resent you and the fact that youre a nice person just makes it worse well ive been watching you ive watched you eat ive watched you speak ive watched the way you move and i see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at i think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time and you know what i am selfconscious but not in the same way that you are you have got to be the most attractive self conscious person ive ever seen not usually i mean honestly i havent known many guys that could think straight with an erection so i feel im way ahead of the game as far as being clearheaded goes well let me put it this way i can not achieve an erection while in the presence of another person so for all practical purposes i am impotent impotent agreed do you want me to why is that do you want them so what about kids i think so i remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what theyre attracted to whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love its up to you but i warn you if you tell me something personal i might do the same i know that i just dont feel a connection with very many people so i dont waste time with people i dont feel one with hmm well maybe you are really i wouldnt pay much attention yeah i know i mean im not saying i know people think youre a bitch im saying i know what you mean and i dont even know that people think youre a bitch do they how do you mean no lawyers do i pay taxes of course i pay taxes only a liar doesnt pay taxes im not a liar a liar is the second lowest form of human being i dont know sister older or younger this food is excellent i would imagine that we are now i think im ready to use the bathroom finally oh lots of reasons most of them boring but up until i dropped out john and i were very much alike i knew him very well we were extremely close until i dropped out yes i was surprised that he accepted when i asked if i could stay here until i found a place nine years exactly i would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things or could mean lots of things anyway i think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned did you know that if you shut someone up in a room and the only clock he has reference to runs two hours slow for every twentyfour that his body will eventually adjust to that schedule simply because the mind honestly perceives that twentysix hours are twentyfour the body follows and then there are sections of time your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality for instance when i was twelve i had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship now im not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to and then were crystallized in that eleven minutes yes so you feel security stability like things are going to last awhile what about it do you like im not being critical id really like to know no i was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone the whole thing was really irrelevant how do you like being married oh well i did i was in a band once and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible i used to take great pleasure in that being purposefully different rubbing peoples noses in it didnt you do that when you were younger oh well maybe im uncomfortable with my appearance i feel a little out of place in these surroundings are you uncomfortable with my appearance yeah i guess it is my mother is a complete anglophile anything british makes her drool like a baby she probably heard the name in some movie shes a prisoner of public television now curious yes have you ever been on television yes oh you mean to bring in no yes i have some other things no i dont need to bring them in this is all i need to stay here oh no problem it can wait false alarm graham dalton ann no im sorry i cant do it cynthia i dont know i would no ouch okay i deserved that cynthia dont you understand after the first time its just not spontaneous theres no edge anymore look at the tapes there is only one date on each label i have never taped anyone twice im sure a substantial number of men in this town would volunteer no youll have to get somebody else i never do more than one im sorry no okay hello is that what he tells you different yes yes if you wish youre not wearing any underwear then what happened what did he say what about when you touched it what did you expect it to feel like and then what did it really feel like were you disappointed what did you think did it look like you expected live or in a photograph or film of some sort how unfortunate so when did you finally get to see a penis was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward your first sexual experience describe for me your first sexual experience i am now recording tell me your name just a moment whichever you prefer no that depends on you one woman only used three minutes another filled up three two hour tapes yes i turn on the camera you start talking absolutely not they are for my private use only yes thats all i just want to ask you questions nothing sex your sexual history your sexual preferences talking why dont you let me tape you not exactly what do you get spooked nope i think the man is a liar i dont understand why did you want to come here i mean i cant imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me how did you find me she didnt give you my address she didnt tell you why she was upset and are you here to berate me for making her that way no i really cant i find it healthy never to characterize people i dont know or conversations i havent heard i dont know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else last time i saw ann she left here very confused i would say and upset i just want to know why youre here she called you that too may i ask why youre here the extrovert do i know you who are you how about for five hundred will you lease monthtomonth no you said threefifty itll just be me youre hesitating i think that means you have have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband im not going to give you my keys my keys no no no god you need help shes not property john shes a person were you just going to keep right on lying to her john as a lawyer you should know that those tapes are private property what tapes hi john or go someplace in a hurry i like having the car the car is important i wish i didnt have to live someplace she held up very well yes this afternoon i was grilling ann about your marriage this afternoon im sorry am i prying again you have family here also a bonfire probably everybody has a pastgod damn you you bitch i knew it you son of a bitch bastard goddam right answer me godammit did you make one of those tapes youre leaving me for him arent you well that makes a sad sort of sense he cant and you wont goddammit goddammit that son of a bitch well at least i know you didnt fuck him where did you go when you left here why what jesus christ what the hell happened i came home and your car was gone

ethiopia isnt therapy helping at all yeah jeez give me some credit i dont either i mean cynthia of all people shes so im sorry its just im under a lot of pressure with this kirkland thing its my first big case as junior partner and i work all day i come home i look forward to seeing you and it hurts that you accuse me like that goddam right i mean can you imagine your honor im positive this man is guilty i cant place him at the scene or establish a motive but i have this really strong feeling look this conversation is utterly ridiculous maybe when you have some evidence we should talk but dont give me conjecture and intuition im not either i was just saying you know i didnt get paranoid when you didnt want to make love i could have easily assumed that you didnt want to because you were having an affair for gods sake ann i am not fucking your sister i dont find her that attractive for one ann you are completely paranoid not ten minutes ago i wanted to make love for the first time in weeks and you act like im dipped in shit you know i think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on theres nothing to know ann no im not frankly im offended at the accusation jesus christ whered that come from i have a late lunch by myself and now im fucking somebody something wrong i ate by myself then maybe i saw an old message there are a lot of them on my desk you know yes i just got busy tuesday i had a late lunch mmmmm stay away from the garden district serious crime i dont know what kind of place youre looking for but there are a lot of studiotype apartments available elsewhere are you going to see elizabeth while youre here thats the first thing that ran through my mind when i saw you i thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade i knew it i knew it things are getting complicated maybe i dont want to leave maybe i want to talk god you youre mean i cant believe i let him stay in my house right under my nose that deviant fucker was right under my nose and i didnt see him graham did he put you up to this well im here now id like to do something look are we going to do it or not by definition youre lying to ann too it hurts that you would say that to me what do you mean you trust him you realize you have no recourse legally this stuff could show up anywhere it just wasnt a smart thing to do did you sign any sort of paper or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldnt broadcast these tapes i just ann is very its just something id prefer she didnt know about i wish you hadnt done that you told ann about this interact fine but did you have to masturbate in front of him for gods sake i mean jesus i could almost understand it if he was screwing these people almost why doesnt he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something jesus christ and he doesnt have sex with any of them they just talk what if this tape gets into the wrong hands shit after what youve told me i dont know i shouldve known when he showed up dressed like some arty brat that you you dont even know the guy its just so blatantly stupid i have a hard time believing you did it do you want me to stop calling nothing wrong with trying shes there whats she doing there cynthia john jesus i dont know if i can get away ive got a client waiting id have to do some heavy duty juggling when john millaney you know what i mean oh well when then cynthia john in here cynthia john meet me at my house in exactly one hour youre intrigued

your apartment then youll still have one key what do you mean really howd it go you were prying before yeah its not bad usually ann has some serious salt action going i keep telling her you can always add more if you want but you cant take it out what do you think the greeks would make of that outfit youre wearing yes anyway ive always said the work is the thing i can be happy without a marriage but take away my work thats different and if ann cant handle that thats her problem like we re all alone in this world you know what im saying i mean fuck jesus whats takin this guy john millaney brian kirkland please all right jesus okay in a minute im on with a client yeahnot for threefifty plus first and last month deposit student plenty of room for two peopletoo fine badalato the bad news is youre gon na live thataboy hospital demerol what the fuck is your problem man you wan na die and one good guy he was your snitch i know about esparza from chinatown which is right up the street from the morgue where did you go with the body what did you do with it an hour after you picked it up in other words seven times out of a hundred youre wrong isnt there a ten to fifteenpercent margin of error forensic ballistics isnt an exact science is it or this is this a significant difference you would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun and the one on the right is the bullet you testfired from shus gun the photo on the left shows the bullet that killed jimmy chin true wheres the nearest hospital let go of my hair i have to talk to your brother i would like to put shus alleged crime in a context your honor and we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room if it please the court id like to call mr reynard i suppose i could find an inmate whod say that shu boasted about chinatown just to survive in the joint though he didnt really do it your honor i imagine that no matter how careful my questioning mr ortega would in his wellintentioned way dig my clients hole even deeper i move that the witnesss testimony be stricken he has clearly been terrorized by the prosecution hes objection your honor thats not fair with objection objection your honor the fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial hey the fact you popped jimmy chin in broad daylight proves it wasnt premeditated juryll sympathize dude was banging your wife right what everything you shot a corpse i dont give a shit about that dowd eddie dowd we look im a lawyer and do you see a toilet here you think is really me im a lawyer the firm is thinking about renovating everything dates back to the sixties not necessarily we dont prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak judge brandeis said it best entrapment is a dirty business no its not the only issue theres another issue for the jury what about entrapment yeah well i had reasonable cause to believe the judge mightve heard of the fourth amendment clyde you wait here glenn got a minute no further questions ah how can you remember that you cant remember that oh really come now did you see the gun no no your honor the witness response was nonresponsive i ask you to strike it from the record not at all didnt this information come from the joe boys themselves did they not all but hand you shu kai kim a korean an outsider a description what asian male 18 to 30 black hair brown eyes exactly what information led you to arrest my client just twoandahalf hours after the shooting took place how long did it take badalato to drive jimmy chins body from chinatown to the morgue least wed already be at the morgue everyone else was wrong and the one fucking lunatic was right they couldve been brothers its why the eyewitnesses picked shu ive seen this picture before you phoned up art esparzas wife whats art esparza roger ive got a meeting in chinatown im not that desperate thats not gon na happen im gon na create reasonable doubt buckle your seatbelt and watch me work you know how i know cause reynard says hes guilty and reynards full of shit look hey you believe what you want shu kai kim is innocent thats why i hate experts but what what do you mean you sneaked a peek at the rolodex nice what goddam it the little punk bests me again i get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you eddie dowd a fucking wheelchair george is a fucking burnout case i didnt want him on the stand anyway get more names from billy hey clyde gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost were clydes buddies its cool next exit so an upstanding member of the aryan warriors wouldnt paint them on they take those teardrops seriously theyre badges of courage of honor only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them theres no one else to talk to the tattoos were phony theyre just frightened fuckedup losers that prison fucked up worse his name is chuckie roeder but somethings very weird saving it for the sunday times have to no cecil stipe find it that dd5 cecil stipe have we seen any affadavit with that name a complaint followup form when did you start working for the goddam da easy no we have to find some piece of evidence that got buried to reopen the sucker i dont know but it makes one hell of an opening statement some gang punk gets wasted in front of the tourists the mayor pressures the cops the cops pressure the rival gang the joe boys the joes give up shu kai kim the schmuck kid from korea whos been pestering em to get in eight years ago the chinatown hit were taking the other case with two knives taped to his hands forget it rog remember the nazi he knifed chinatown street gang ossining correctional facility sing sing everybodys innocent there man just ask em ten years is a long time hey you plan to be a criminal defense attorney know this going in everybodys guilty so go take your job on wall street im not a kid anymore i cant be all over the map i specialize roger damn right im right through use of informants eavesdropping unreasonable search and seizure i dont venerate drug dealers roger to the contrary we have a full caseload rog and i call your testimony hearsay i have no more questions for you pardon which dialect do you speak do you speak cantonese mandarin or both youre the police expert in chinatown gangs screw you too kitty i dont need sleep exactly nothing has but thats all changing you do got any booze in the house i havent paid you i havent thanked you for your work kitty youre doing good work the joe boys in 1980 find him i dont have time to read every word in every report im too busy getting killed in court meantime my crackerjack investigator cant find the goddam art supplies store where chuckiefuckingroeder works a fucking wheelchair have you considered that chuckie roeders not calling himself chuckie roeder these days get his mugshot from one of the many law officers whove got hotpants for you then canvass those art supplies places were gon na win this one kitty but ya got ta believe but i like that theory and since im not putting twerp professor on the stand and since i dont have a better theory im sticking with that theory meantime i want pictures of the joes whatll you bet there was a guy in the gang looked enough like shu to fool the eyewitnesses i lied i embroidered i embellished start looking into the joe boys who assigned the hits in 1980 what rank generally did the hits your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use forget it youve blown your chance to participate in this case kitty kitty where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans lem me guess some corporate vps banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder stipe was just one of four eyewitnesses who came forward kitty youghta start looking for the others it hasnt been that long murder witness for awhile we had this dream we were innocent that was our bond but then we woke up and now id like to hear everything by trusting me shit man jimmy chin was that selfdefense too i didnt need to know that a man im defending on a gangmurder rap is a prison soldier who kills over drugs quite a bit you didnt tell me im dying out there no what well i know that youre innocent shu even if you forgot you cant so tell me what you do know say it no you tell me shu what went down about what afraid of what but why but why would a guy would do that paint black teardrops on his face an aryan warrior with black teardrops painted on his face okay exactly what happened then want to tell me what went down here thats right mr rabin has no right to thank you mr stipe did the police make any attempt to phone you to follow up you told the desk sergeant you were certain mr kim wasnt the killer you left your telephone number when the da hears i filed the writ hell send someone here maybe claiming to be a journalist that person will ask you lots of questions just be truthful cecil okay to all of us are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot jimmy chin was not the man the cops arrested good now were going to take an affadavit from you but only concerning the facts of the chinatown shooting we honestly dont give a shit about the kennedy assassination oh come on cecil seecil im eddie dowd this is roger baron were lawyers lo cecil no then what did he say i hope so mr reynard isnt it true that without esparza you had no investigation i didnt say he was an informant but since you mentioned it wasnt esparza your primary informant but you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation and who was arturo esparza the same three detectives on the jimmy chin case and who were the detectives who assisted you mr reynard did you do any handson work or did you just supervise from on high didnt this investigation with its attendant publicity catapult you into the office you now hold id need a continuance three weeks at least alleged crime the great personal sacrifices endured by mr reynard have no bearing on the legal issues your honor objection your honor this case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with your honor thats trial by ambush to the best of your recollection were you sober when you performed the tests you dont speak any chinese dialects then you get your intelligence from snitches isnt it unusual for a man whos just committed a murder in plain sight to bring the weapon back to his apartment isnt it a standard trick to pack a lineup with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses isnt it a fact that the six other asian men in the lineup were all of the classic mongoloid type whereas shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a korean thats big of you bob but im a quick study tell your deputy da rabin that ill see him in court you know youre very tense mr reynard youghta take a week off fly the wife and kids to oahu i never joke about waiving a clients sixth amendment right to trial thats right please dont bullshit me mr reynard youve got witness problems youve got proof problems what am i looking for youre the one talking deal are you implying that my motives are less than sincere id have that checked mr reynard im sorry if ive ruined your day mr reynard but my clients had a rough eight years behind bars and its in the area of narcotics mr reynard that the government tramples on the fourth amendment this and that shu kai kim edward t dowdchinatown sounded pretty cold shus the only one i know of soldado thats right a soldado he takes care of it cigarettes candy bars pcp crack a soldado he runs messages and materiel between the regiments im a soldado in the gwing regiment yeah we do some of that i would tend to plead the fifth fighting the aryan warriors and the black guerrillas basically a cubano army basically inside and outside prisons five years i would tend to plead the fifthno i think youre a dangerous man mr dowd youre trespassing into the area of witness protection mr dowd such showboating puts lives at risk i cant be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact i dont think i know that name in those days they often worked as a team lou sklaroff vin badalato dave montell mr dowd i was personally involved with all phases and principals of the investigation if i were sitting where i normally sit i would say calls for speculation yes mr dowd cant mr dowd find his own expert witness your honor in a context your honor i know as much about these gangs as anyone im well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked i assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendants crime the witness is recalcitrant your honor i had to personally make a body attachment this morning it took two marshalls to drag him here the witness will substantiate mr kims modus operandi its circumstantial evidence in the case at hand we just discovered him your honor his appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case he is an inmate at ossining correctional and objection badgering calls for speculation argumentative objection the witness is not an expert in racial classification ill prosecute anyone who fucks up if that makes me look racist its a tradeoff ill live with ed no mr dowd youll see me in court im prosecuting this case but now youve strayed from your area of expertise dope into street assassins a subject on which youre dangerously ignorant youre pissing me off again ed we reconvict your mans looking at 25 years on two counts served consecutively so what id like to ask ed is are you joking i see hed walk out next month youre my only problem ed what does it take to make you go away fridays the dropdead date on the offer yes but thats not the issue whats on your wish list ed pleading kim out to first degree man on both homicides with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent come on whatre you looking for here now maybe you got this case reopened because you see yourself as a thorn in societys side or you want to walk into any restaurant in chinatown and get free dumplings back in the seventies i spent years putting away gangsters in a colombian syndicate called the ochoa these guys are very dangerous ed when i hear that a smalltime dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys i see red your client is guilty dont dick around with me lets not drag the constitution into this my staff tells me its been mostly drug pushers i said that cant be the same edward dowd you wont remember this but in 72 i was one of several prosecutors assigned to the black pantherpolice shootout we had a whole team and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt so whatve you been up to since then of course you know dean rabin one of my assistant das dean generally handles nuisance cases like the whats the mans name don reynard you mean to say mr kim told you that he murdered jimmy chin and why was an exception made isnt it unusual for an asian to be accepted into a cuban prison gang mr ortega what is shu kai kims rank within la compania by takes care of you mean kills if a member of the aryan brothers tries to cut in on your distribution materiel what do you mean by that and what does a soldado a soldier do name rank and serial mr ortega lets not hide behind the fifth what is your rank within la compania do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade for control of the prison drug trade and its purpose mr ortega what is la compania mr ortega youve known the defendant at ossining correctional for how long an hour thats why i thought the morgue was on the other side of town jesus the killer wasnt chinese cecil stipe was right christ shu is innocent what i followed her from the courthouse i think he hired shu to kill jimmy chin it wasnt a chinatown gang hit jimmy chin and arts wife were lovers she just about told me eddie its art esparza lets get a cab i am eddie weve got nothing but roeders dead ballistics says its shu we dont have one witness unless we put cecil stipe on the stand youre carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend i dont want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns eddie eddie its one thing to compare clyde gruner to jesus christ its even okay to claim that shu kai kim is just slightly holier than the pope as long as you dont really believe it ive heard from the last ballistics expert on the list its an even ten who say shus gun killed jimmy chin well i mean roeders gone now a dead end believe me im sorry too but so whatre we gon na do chuckies address i sneaked a peek at the rolodex 1530 rivington street roger baron a spinal injury in the line of duty it was in kittys report uh eddie the um ballistics guy george he called and his tests show that shus gun fired the bullet that killed jimmy chin i feel much better now yeah i didnt ask for a closing argument you found his mugshot shoulda told the one about shu being the bastard child of mother theresa do you have to do that what the lunatic who listen november 5 1980 cecil stipe walked into 5th precinct says he witnessed chin shooting saw suspects picture in post says shu kai kim wrong man eddie whats a dd5 eddie i dont know about this are you sure we want that easy as that huh you really think thats what happened what other case i feel like ive been mugged guy scared the shit out of me you made your point eddie im relieved were not taking the case so what would we claim he stabbed duane lindeman in selfdefense at the trial you said you were at your apartment that night alone kim denied it but he admitted the gun was his and he got life seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years til the incident with duane lindeman kim got busted at 19 for burglary at 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young chinese gang lord the prosecution claimed kim did it to get into the joe boys where look im tired ill see you in the morning eddie dont tell me where to work i moved to new york to work for edward dowd but i cant believe that edward dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little a speed manufacturer an angel dust dealer its just i leave behind friends family a coupla good job offers in chicago and in three dizzying weeks ive helped acquit a coke dealer a speed dealer right youre right of course right i forgot were pledged to protect every midlevel drug dealer in the tristate area its an awesome responsibility shouldnt one of us every word ill take odds on cecil number two eddie told you roger chuckie odd mrs esparza hes dead then it was your idea to have chuckie roeder scare eddie off the case and you were at the trial to to see that justice was done i followed you here from court what were you why were you at shus trial this afternoon im roger baron i work with edward dowd the phone company was broken up cia i think what eddie wants to say is mr stipe a young man named jimmy chin was shot to death eight years ago in chinatown do you remember talking to the policewhen you leave this place youre going out to dinner or a movie or get laid wheres our bond im going back to my

hell raiser how was dinner why doesnt he let you do what you want charlie dalton hey guys why dont you show tina the dead poets garden this is it yaa im a dead poet except sex oh come on cameron dont you get anything and english and trig its every bit as hard as they say unless youre a genius like meeks so much the better i couldnt stop myself its nuwanda cameron why nobody knows who we are i thought id be spontaneous i mean thats the point of this whole thing isnt it it should but i found it and now i claim it carpe cavern guys seize the cave i hereby declare this the charles dalton cave for passionate experimentation in the future anyone wishing entry must have permission from me oh come on pitts im sorry i we yes sir yeah like what but i thought youre siding with mr nolan what about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that mr keating i here and now commit myself to daring o no it is an everfixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken it is the star to every wandering bark whose worths unknown although his height be taken all right im thinking let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove but im not what i think youre sweet and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other what the hell are we doing miss it it drives us crazy thats part of what this club is about in fact id like to announce that ive published an article in the school paper in the name of the dead poets society demanding girls be admitted to welton so we can all stop beating off i told you thats a secret its only me mr nolan i swear i made it up yes sir no one sir it was just me i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob cranes welton academy hello yes he is just a moment mr nolan its for you yes sir we were just talking about that doing fine sir its better than doing nothing maybe hell have some advice maybe hell even talk to your father why dont you talk to mr keating about it damn it neil the name is nuwanda im supposed to turn everybody in apologize to the school and all will be forgiven no hey would you not worry about your precious little necks if they catch me ill tell them i made it up all your asses are safe look gloria and tina didnt come here to listen to us argue are we gon na have a meeting or what im one of the proofers i slipped the article in they were walking along the fence past the soccer field said they were curious about the school so i invited them to the meeting nothing unless you object to having girls here its nuwanda my parents made me take clarinet but i hated it the sax is more sonorous all right ill second that im in youre welcome to join us todd i dont know about anyone else but i could use a refresher in latin eight oclock in my room okay so i dont like it any more than you do im just saying oh yeah sure valedictorian national merit scholar thats not my fault whats his specialty brownnosing well meeks aced latin and i didnt quite flunk english so if you want weve got our study group hey i heard you went to summer schoolanything else youd care to rifle through mr dalton so keep your head about youthe lot of youunderstood like if nothing else the opportunity to attend my classes understand sucking out the marrow doesnt mean getting the bone stuck in your throat charles you still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you i dont know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt mr dalton but whatever it was i hope youve learned your lesson so avoid using the word very because its lazy a man is not very tired he is exhausted dont use very sad use morose language was invented for one reason boysto woo womenand in that endeavor laziness will not do it also wont do in your essays we used to meet here on special occasions who would like to convene the meeting rahesh non never existed mr meeks you make him or someone like him up no self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one i received and dont limit poetry to the word poetry can be found in a work of art music a photograph in the way a meal is preparedanything with the stuff of revelation in it it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never never be ordinary by all means write about the sky or a girls smile but when you do let your poetry conjure up salvation day doomsday any day i dont care as long as it enlightens us thrills us andif its inspiredmakes us feel a bit immortal precisely meeks greek for the herd however be warned that when you say the hoi polloi you are actually saying the the herd indicating that you too are hoi polloi seize the day while youre young see that you make use of your time why does the poet write these lines very good mr gather ye rosebuds while ye may the latin term for that sentiment is carpe diem anyone know what that means i always thought education was learning to think for yourself oh that that was an exercise to prove a point about the evils of conformity courtyard your reprimand made quite an impression im sure i didnt know you taught come on boys dont be shy dont stop excellent have him act give it rhythm a sweatytoothed madman now theres the poet speaking close your eyes and think of the picture describe what you see now use your imagination first thing that pops to your mind even if its gibberish a madman perhaps he was what kind of madman dont think answer todd theres a picture of whitman over the door what does he remind you of quickly anderson dont think about it all right very good theres a barbarian in there after all louder again louder good god boy yell a barbaric yawp really you told your father what you told me you let him see your passion for acting what did your father say did you talk to him not if youre going to stay true to yourself give your father the benefit of the doubt talk to him let him see who you are well if its more than a whim then youll have to prove that to him youll have to show him with your passion and commitment that its what you really want to do if that doesnt work at least by then youll be eighteen and able to do what you want neil i know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what youre feeling you have to let him see who you are its your only chance then youre playing a part for him too arent you a dangerously self destructive one you cant live a life for someone else neil you can only live for yourself have you told your father what you just told me have you shown him your passion about acting ah but i am seeing the world neil the new world seeing a student like you take root and bloom its worth everything thats why i came back here a place like this needs at least one teacher like me did you come here to talk about my teaching maybe they dont want worldly things distracting me from my teaching okay all poetry was acceptable the name simply referred to the fact that to join the organization you had to be dead nothing wrong with research ah so you boys have been snoopingwill do actually i dont really know mutt actually i dont no relation never heard of him sorry ill tell you later yep the point is she was thinking about me ive only met her once and already shes thinking about me damn it its gon na happen i feel it shes going to be mine well hell no charlie but thats not the point thats not the point at all so yeah can you believe it she was gon na call me she invited me to a party with her no ive been calm all my life if i dont do something its gon na kill me god i cant take it anymore if i dont have chris ill kill myself needs chris must have chris the millions are awake enough for physical labor but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life to be awake is to be alive but why it will how do you figure i dont know i dont get it what is the dead poets society terrible awful i met the most beautiful girl ive ever seen in my life yeah tell him off it couldnt get any worse knox overstreet its just for a little while you promised

here well both be in big trouble you cant be in here chris all im asking you to do is listen the heavens made a girl named chris with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her

you chris well sure you are shes glad i called hello chris this is knox overstress sort of so uh where are you in school the pleasure is mine yes sir they perpetuate mechanical living sir they limit your mind we thought it would be good to break old habits sir i dont know she wont even see me pitts damn damn if i could just get chris to read this poem you really think i should forget her i cant just forget her pitts and i certainly cant think about math its not too bad its a tragedy why does she have to be in love with a jerk im calling her but shes in love with the moron son of my fathers best friend what would the dead poets say about that shes practically engaged to chet danburry mr mondo jocko himself theyre friends of my dad probably in their nineties or something all right jesus

i dont understand tom here tells me theres a problem with the pianos we were assured they were in tune good morning gentlemen im mr daniels the manager i believe ive spoken to one of you on the phonedont be ridiculous dear christ not another word do you hear me she never shouldve set foot on this ship this is your fault whats that what you sent her out there with a murderer running around loose christwheres rennie wheres the radio she changed her mind lets seemr wolfe is in stateroom oneeleven and you mr robertson are in twotwentyfive rennies not coming thats it youre not setting foot off this ship until we return home where did you get that alcohol then ill make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights i11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes miss mason youd better have your biology project ready or im phoning your parents what are you doing in here all right but if it mysteriously disappears en route ill have you sent back home the minute we dock understood my nieces life hangs in the balance right now every second counts everyone split up well cover more ground that way a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat mr robertson what did you do with rennie use some common sense setting off a fire alarm causes panicthe same kind of panic caused by suggesting jason voorhees is on board enough is enough i doubt very much that one even exists hes the son of the captain for chrissakes youd think hed be able to operate this thing shes locked safe in her room no thanks to either of you has he brought it back on course yet walking corpses are not real that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded its no coincidence i demand to know what is going on i thought i told you to stay away from her oh i can see that youve done a wonderful job of supervising the kids miss van deusen im her legal guardian not you or anybody else and i alone know whats best for her end of discussion she doesnt know what she wants shes never had a stable life you have no right lets go were running two minutes late jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up im a little concerned you can and you will swim rennie am i lets find out oh he is indeed and ready to pull down anybody who falls in and cant swim he never learned how either and hes still at the bottom of this lake youve been coming out here every summer for the last three years young lady and you still havent learned how perfect for a swim isnt it i was only trying to teach you but i pulled you out rennie i saved your life you can and you will get in the boat rennie this isnt a request whatever youve beenimagining has nothing to do with jason voorhees i want you to be safe rennie thats all i care about i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship im the one you should be listening to do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever you had me worried to death facing your fear doesnt always conquer it why are you doing this to yourself if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of youre making a big mistake rennie its not too late to put you back on landjasons here in new york we have to get off this ship this is jasons fault the fire alarm shesshes dropping the anchors i thought the coast guard could find us easier if itsdead but i thought which

okay i want you to wait by the lifeboats just in case rule one dont panic rule two assess the damage and act accordingly rennie i didnt mean for you to go the bowfront of the ship theres a hoist on each side that lowers them i think so but we have to lower the anchors so we dont drift any further i dont knowweve gone off course or something if i go with you hell never speak to me again but im never going to live up to his expectations anywayso maybe its the right thing to do not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for but i think i can convince him to call a coast guard

bargain at the high end of our range ill have a stroke ive got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks you wanted furniture too didnt you high end honey its a whole new budget stop knowing me so well whats that what wed have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool neil calm down get on the other side of that no man go to your room do you see a man you knew a second ago who

really up to you brooding endlessly isnt going to help matters any well these are good signs shes broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport because life isnt about playing it safe life is about taking risks you have to put yourself out there a bit more ask her how she feels its not going to happen unless you make it happen my friend youre going to have to assert yourself a little bit more show your affection well now dont go creating some artificial environment for yourself who doesnt a sense of proportion that would be monumentally stupid all im saying is on the contrary this is tremendous i mean were all frightened to death of disapproval and were constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves and im not saying we should you know declare ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty and please dont for gods sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way the whole disapproval thing if you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone elses potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life then youre back to a life of fear arent you youre a prisoner to that again and that isnt much of a life as long as you keep remembering why thats terrific dont be afraid to be demonstrative youre sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke and how are things with your lady friend if i may call her that youre responsible for your own actions and you dont mean to hurt anyone in other words youve done your best im saying dont carry the burden of other peoples actions on your shoulders because theyre beyond your control listen no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy but when the time comes you have to do it and you hope the outcome will be good for both of you you come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race as difficult as that sometimes can be oh good well i hope youll have more to tell me next time right so you have a new place youve started working a bit im sure youll be meeting some new people hospital im happy that youre working again as long as it comes naturally thats terrific youve always liked working with your hands havent you and what about work have you had any more thoughts about what youd like to be doing now all right then thats important isnt it for you to be in an up environment im saying you should literally take that as your base do you know what i mean its something positive that youve accomplished even if you were forced by circumstance something for you to build upon and the rent is okay hows the new placedont worry i dont want to give up any more that it acquires intelligence from its victims well if they were perfecting an aquaman then whys there a

rescue ship well need it which way to the turbo shaft if we could send a distress signal then well have to get them out the old fashioned way i hope it wont come to that mr scott very well mr scott

wouldnt be far from the truth standard orbit mr sulu put it on the screen put it on the veiwscreen would you please why didnt you beep my communicator yes i lost a brother once i was lucky i got him back maybe hes not out there bones maybe hes right here in the human heart spock spock i thought i was going to die spock what is this spock dont mark two request emergency assistance acknowledge to anyone within the sound of my voice this is captain james t kirk of the federation starship enterprise if you read me acknowledge acknowledge spock fire the rockets spock the booster rockets it must be all those marsh melons hmmm the only problem is its up there were down here new word b a um a nuh d end of word youre right im a little out of practice uhthats an s thats a little vague spock spock my only concern is getting the ship back when thats done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until youre green in the face until then youre either with me or youre not but the center of the galaxy cant be reached no ship has ever gone into the great barrier no probe has ever returned is what possible this er person didnt by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble did he how do you know theres got to be a way out of this place hes sorry see hes sorry everything that makes everything all right hes sorry everythings why didnt you tell me this before i got ta sit down there you see see you did too sybok couldnt possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you dont have a brother you mean hes your brother brother you made that up look the man may be a fellow vulcan but that doesnt i ordered you to defend this ship you stay out of this why spock why i all you had to do was pull the trigger forgive you i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass what you have done is betray every man on this ship damnit spock god damnit let me do something an eternity during which well be vulnerable to klingon attack korrdyou tell him be one with the horse spock we dont have 12 hours mr sulu execute that puts us pretty far away from paradise city damn lets go fascinating why what do you mean who is it he reminds you of but he does seem familiar spock what is it do you know this vulcan what is it you look like youve seen a ghost general korrds military strategies were required learning when i was a cadet at the academy when they put me out to pasture i hope i fare better than korrd not general korrd i could use a shower goodnight spock goodnight bones go to sleep spock yes spock spock were on leave you can call me jim come on spock why didnt you jump in the lyrics are are very simple its er row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream the doctor and i will start it off and then when we give you the signal you jump in doctor if you please row row row your boat i love row do do you know row row row row row your boat pack up your troubles thats great i havent sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa what are we going to sing what bones what are we going to sing what are you doing ive always known ill die alone oh no it isnt that i knew i wouldnt die because the two of you were with me oh god spock i appreciate your concern but if you dont stop distracting me im liable to be one on the contrary gravity is foremost on my mind look im trying to make an ascent here why dont you go pester dr mccoy for a while mm because its there im not trying to break any records im doing this because i enjoy it not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain spock what are you doing in this neck of the woods kirk to enterprise listen carefully what makes you think i wont turn us around no special conditions about the ship you are mad your vision wait you know well never make it through the great barrier no i refuse no i didnt spock what have you done to my friends the only realty i see is that im a prisoner on my own ship what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew im afraid of nothing you cant expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier ill take you to the bridge in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible were going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually sybok listen to me in order for this craft to enter the landing bay enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam to get us inside and reraise the shields will take james t kirk captain of the enterprise you staged all this to get your hands on my shipi was thinking of sybok ive lost a brother not possible you were never alone welcome aboard captain i believe we are witnessing my birth its all right captain proceed mark two the emergency channel open if i activate them now captain we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate it would appear we are too heavy uhuh i believe i have found a faster way there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room c k a t i am here captain sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known there sha ka ree is fabled to exist that hes found it sha ka ree the reason sybok left vulcan is it possible he did have pointed ears the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find he failed to escape this is a new brig captain it is escapeproof i was not disposed to discuss matters of a personal nature for that im sorry exactly that is correct syboks mother was a vulcan princess upon her death sybok and i were raised as brothers i have a half brother technically you are correct i do not have a brother i did not no no no captain you do not understand sybok also in a son of sarek you ordered me to kill my brother if i had pulled the trigger sybok would be dead if you think it would help worse i have betrayed you i do not expect you to forgive me captain what have i done you must allow us to act exactly 155 seconds yes captain yes captain at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 12 hours to land any closer would risk detection their equipment is primitive but effective i recommend we land at coordinate 8563 klingon vessel now entering quadrant bird of prey estimating 19 hours until her weapons come to bear when he encouraged others to follow him he was banished from vulcan never to return he believed the key to selfknowledge was emotion not logic he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief there was a young student exceptionally gifted possessing of great intelligence it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan but he was a revolutionary i do not often think of the past he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth i can not be certain perhaps i have captain perhaps i have the same hes apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command yes goodnight doctor yes captain life is not a dream jim captain i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words that song did not come up in my research captain are we leaving captain oh i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong i am preparing to toast a marsh melon i dont understand perhaps because it is there is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain concentration is vital you must be one with the rock i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods i do not think you realize the gravity of your situation ah captain and that is i regret to inform you that the record for freeclimbing el captain is in no danger of being broken im flattered twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me sybok we must find a way sybok sybok this is not the god of sha ka ree or any other god sybok you are my brother but you do not know me i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago since that time i have found myself and my place i know who i am and i can not go with you i belong here i can not go with you do you i hide no pain no i will not sybok you must surrender i am a starfleet officer it was not my intention to amuse you these are serious charges however if you surrender nowit runs deep share it with me i couldnt help but notice you pain the ship no no its not possible why why have you done this to my friend he has his doubts it will be your chariot it could yes with a starship we sought only your infinite wisdom it was not the barrier stood between us but we breached it qual se tu do you realize what youve done it wasnt bloodshed i wanted whats going on then its fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me in the meantime captain chekov i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates your threats amuse me captain chekov what consequences did you have in mind a federation starship spock what have i done because you too must know no conditions the ship needs its captain am i well see given to me by god he waits for us on the other side but if we do will that convince you that my vision was true now learn something about yourself ive done nothing this is who they are didnt you know that i dont control minds i free them sha ka ree the scource heaven eden call it quitu to the romulans its vorta vor the andorian word is unpronounceable still every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang for us that place will soon be a reality what you fear is the unknown the people of your planet once believed their world was flat columbus proved it was round they said the sound barrier could never be broken it was broken they said warp speed could not be achieved the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear its an extension of personal fear captain kirk i so much want your understanding i want your respect are you afraid to hear me out i trust your message was received we must change our course at once what are you doing no no reply remain on course but i thought captain chekov i see very clever captain spock it would appear that youve been given a second chance to join me what do you say who are you i must have your starship no you must save yourselves forgive me brother forgive me this is my doing this is my arrogance my vanity i dont understand reveal yourself to me i dont understand why not spock i know you better than that each mans pain is unique you know im right put him in the brig with captain kirk spock you will accompany me to the bridge no you must kill me of course of course then ill take the ship without your help im sorry spock i cant surrender now im not through violating neutral zone treaty in fact im just getting started and now for my next violation i intend to steal something something very big spock youve developed a sense of humor after all
