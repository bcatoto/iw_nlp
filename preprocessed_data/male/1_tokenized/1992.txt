game i dont know if theres two of you involved or what but were going to find out last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place it mustve shocked the hell out to you when frank walked in on pine road and you couldnt finish youre a lying bastard you sure you werent over on pine road were interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there homesearchers then whats he talking about theres a photostat of the original on the wall you got it on the board well then you just got ta find out where he is and once youre sure where he is you shoot the fucker i used to with my old man he taught me how to hunt and trap trappings a lot harder than most people think we used to go after raccoons mostly theyd get into our garbage our fields when an animal cant live peacefully with those around it it has to be destroyed but theyre crafty little devils you see the trick is you can put your trap down but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent you ever smell raccoon scent smells like shit but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy hell walk right up to that trap even though it dont look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it you know why cause he cant help himself the scent drives him so if you want to catch a raccoon all you got ta do is figure out where he is lay down the scent and sooner or later hell walk right into the trap you ever do any hunting peter of course it was otherwise id be breaking and entering thats a felony the door was open thats right i guess only the killer would know that you know i figure thats pretty much how these girls feel just before they get it you think im right you dont tell us how to run our investigation you got that we didnt ask for your opinion doctor what in the hell do you think youre doing slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace are you crazy what all you got ta do is look at the map what do you mean no meaning it looks like his victims are chosen at random oh well be back you can bet on it you like to play games dont you peter it means if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent you are i dont like you casual you were boning her werent you i think youre lying thats what kind of problem we seem to have a little problem here by yourself ive talked to a few people who say you and her were friendly i got ta friend over there he was telling me things are kind of slow so i figured id give him a call have him come down here and look through your records you know give him something to do youre right i cant make you do it besides youre probably gon na be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer ready for round two what is it i spoke to jeremy hes watching sandersons kid sanderson went out after the match and hasnt come back since i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel you alright how is she weve checked theres no one with the last name of emma on the island yeah i am i think hes playing us if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else the fbi has nothing remotely similar to this guy i think hes a first timer sorry no shit im sorry this is just too convenient we wouldnt want someones death to interfere with your games you think hes dirty what do you think no she just moved here last month from portland debi rutlege female caucasian twenty four worked over at the four oaks hotel sorry to ruin your trip to the city but we got a real nut on our hands frank well find the evidence jesus youre sleeping with the guy youve lost your perspective you cant possibly be unbiased oh cmon were not going to spend any more time on this crap are we it doesnt mean anything its sanderson dont fuck with us where did you go but a hundred men could move him what was suspicious about him did anyone look suspicious think did anyone stand out i dont know maybe theres two of them maybe he hired some wino to make the calls why does he call sanderson you should be an actor frank you looked like you were really mad the veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touchyoure losing me he was watching you why did he what youre safe he wouldnt come here kathy please youre going to wear a hole in the carpet you dont want to believe it its a normal reaction feeling better it worked out alright didnt it they asked who would be best suited for this and you i admit i handled it badly sanderson wasnt going to talk to me but youre young attractive the police came to me for help what could i do would you mind keeping your voice down i have guests you might not have done it had you knownive got a feeling were going to go the distance with him let him sweat for a little while its a voice modulator find him i want to talk to him sanderson ive seen a lot of things in my time on the job but nothing like this yurilivich shes unconscious but they think shes going to make it maybe hes going to drug her you still having a problem with this check with the state if hes never killed outside of washington the fbi wouldnt have it nolan anything could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal take it easy both of you what was your relationship with her i dont know but i think youre right hes lying hes got an answer for everything but he doesnt have an alibi local run it down that means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message how long she been dead same as the others thats great theres only two hardware stores on the whole island well check that out what about the blood you mean no prints but hers what about prints anything theres no blood wheres the fuckin blood any sign of rape how long has she been dead whaddaya got nolan okay why dont you go out there well check in with you later i cant arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist do you have someone you can stay with tonight did you see his face the most logical choice were going to work on the message we cant rely on your judgement anymore hes right kathy what time did he get there yes why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure thats a big area to cover it cant be a coincidence the woman that owns it has a son she says hes been on vacation in montana for the last ten days were trying to locate him theres also a cleaning service that comes in once a week were checking that out too maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have all the girls that have been killed have been killed at night theyre all the same type all moved into their homes within the last three months and all of them found their homes through homesearchers what did he mean by huxley you never know how youre going to catch a suspect this aint no photo before we go in i got ta tell you this isnt going to be pretty call dispatch double the patrols i want that area blanketed i dont think it matters last nights victim christie eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town the night before debi rutlege was found in the center i was thinking the same thing he must be local its logical for him to assume that the police would be there but he recognized andys voice and called him by name what about this anything else what about the way he arranged the body kathy it could have been a tape a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself no i told him to i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end and this jeremy its important we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation were not sure what did dr fulton tell you you didnt pick up any vibes from the guy well didnt you tell me that debi rutlege had just moved into her place also do you know how she found the apartment excuse me you said earlier that mary albert just moved in how long ago was that if you can think of anything else give us a call its over peter lets stop the games im not sending a car alright cmon peter were moving you to a cell i understand that this is just another one of your games maybe he just got tired of covering for you answer the question where were you last night wait a minute theres an apartment in that area called the castle arms he uses castlesplural then says cant move me singular not cant move us a building its a commercial area no one lives there i still dont see how he could be playing chess against you theres only enough grids on the map to be half a board how can he be playing chess with you youre not making any moves against him it doesnt make sense is did you tell him about the institute we think he might be making a reference to drugs miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine upstairs and downstairs in his night gown he could be saying the house hes picked is two stories wee willie winkie runs though the street we think he might be making a reference to himself thats alright well take it from here mister sanderson this is doctor sheppard shes a psychologist helping us out why didnt you tell us you were there earlier whats interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing yet she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesnt leave a number that would imply you already knew the number this is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room heres one at 904 pm it says from debi please call me at home i know you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five where did you go after that could you tell me where you were last night i know youre busy so ill get right to it did you know herthe message i figured out what get off me fuck you im tired of your goddam accusations if you want to arrest me go ahead otherwise back off im positive i was at the beach then lets narrow it down if we knew that wed know the answer to the riddle wouldnt we hes telling us where hes going to kill tonight and we cant see it hes not talking about himself no i need the original note what if he doesnt bite what if hes an exceptionally bright raccoon no what do you want no it wasnt howd you get in here i wouldnt know you dont have an investigation without me you got that maybe you should you think youre going to catch him on a trace everything he does is planned out well in advance the only way were going to get him is to rattle him make him slip up lets see how much he wants to play not what who morpheus the greek god of dreams look at the next line her god has gone and left his home morpheus his victims arent random it only means that they appear to be random theres a connection we just have to find it he says its a game all games have a strategy no he says on the photo hell call tomorrow at eleven why not come back then and listen for yourself thats crazy why would i draw attention to myself like that whats that supposed to mean fine dont ask me out on a date it wasnt serious whats your problem casual what are you saying what kind of problem yes chess tournaments can be boring sometimes people have a lot of free time they like to gossip you told me when you called you said she was in the other room drop the knife the pipes i know where you are no wait ill give you anything you want anything please that wouldnt be very sporting remember huxley his play is always fair and just its me you want not her please wait let me speak to my daughter yes ive figured out the message if you kill tonight and im in jail the police will know im innocent you sonofabitch im beginning to think it doesnt mean anything remember eventually revenge they think that you and i are doing this together what word did you leave last night youre next move should have been e2 e3 youre playing the tarakoss opening hello its you whos running out of time youre starting to make mistakes now youre wondering just how much i really know just how close im getting well im closer than you think pal and im gon na nail your ass to the wall i couldnt tell you that it would ruin the game you heard me why did you go out to the institute looking for her you like to brag dont you if its so important why dont you just tell me huxleys quote also says his play is always fair and just how and you want these girls to feel your pain why are you doing this you must have some idea of the pain youre causing people then call them im just trying to play the game just like who but you said you didnt know her why her you know her hello youre not going to tell me that if you got something to say to me just come out and say it where is she what why not why did you write remember on the wall and what path is that did you know her yes why did you kill debi rutlege just a second hello i havent got time for this who is this what scars computers thats how you got into homesearchers records you can get into anything but why why what is it hes in his seventies and lives in holland never mind he died two years ago have computer search for anyone thats used that opening against me there cant be more than a handful d2d4 b1c3 and c1f4 its the number two variation of the tarakoss opening david can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years set up some pieces on the big board okay run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island can we correlate data look for specific things like players ages stuff like that of course not whats this thanks it isnt kathy im sorry honey i cant not today for what dont you have something you want to say to david nothing has he gotten through to any who told you that you want to sleep in my bed tonight i see you forgot to bring youre nightlight didnt you what are you doing up my cheering section did you send the car i signed the confession what about the car look ill do anything you want ill sign anything you want just send a car out to the hotel dont you understand what im telling you thats why he wants me out of the way this is insane cant you see whats going on the killer wants me out of the way hes setting me up jeremy would have never killed himself i went out are we going to go through this again thats got to be it a shadow whats as big a castle as light as air but one hundred men cant move it the shadow of the castle are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building hes not going to give us direct hints hes going to skirt around it a building isnt as light as air whats large but as light as air and cant be moved as large as castles you are still light as the air one hundred men cant move me its posed as a question what am i but he had to dump the body there to make the move thats all he needs hes making the moves its an opening i just cant remember the name okay its a game hes starting it so he moves first hes white e2e4 maybe i already have hes using the map as a chessboard the sonofabitch is playing chess with me as large as castles you are still light as air one hundred men cant move me another one what word did he leave could emma be the name of the girl hes going to kill thats it maybe but i dont think so i think its just a tease what have you come up with on the riddle you want me to go with you maybe i can help weve already met havent we doctor i dont know i was afraid thered be hours of questions i cant afford to miss a game i got it from the tournament directory she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow to my room and then i went for a walk here i played gregory lutz only in passing to say hello to yeah just let me grab a shower no mate in five who says somethings on my mind about what you have something you want to say i want to be the best i can ive got be here for the police when they come then ive got to practise in case you forgot im in the middle of a match right now is it serious we got a problem its a good play but risky i suppose you have something in mind then ill transpose you opened with the english lutz wont use it he opened his first game with it do we have a future its over now i got lucky are you going to come tonight this isnt going to be like the phone book is it youre right the killer told me frank told me its got to be grammatically correct if we could just figure out what the next word is going to be he said the games going to end tonight so theres only going to be one more word because i know what it says this letter ive never opened it because she killed herself but i do its not that easy you dont understand i cant think any more unless its about you ill be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move i think about how you look when you smile remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard ever since my wife died ive been ive been afraid of getting too close to someone again afraid of losing them no listen you have no idea of the kind of pressure im under right now you really havent seen my best side i was thinking that maybe when this is all over we could the other night i said some things that maybe i shouldnt have i mean you havent known me very long and i can see how you thought what you did can i come in right here c4 hes replaying the game i played against him move by move using these girls as the chess pieces all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman who was found in back of a warehouse why wheres the note a fierce magazine brutal an angry magazine a war magazine a mercenary magazine fierce mad exactly its the key in a fierce magazine youll find a hint of my actions to come why does he set this line apart how could you think that kathy how could you even consider it admit what that i was right about you in the steam room that youre willing to do anything to find out what you want would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room then why are you backing up whats wrong i thought you said the line was busy did you call if i have to im going to take a shower you fine call room service no i thought you were the woman who didnt want to get involved this frightens me because im starting to feel things i havent felt in a long time i just dont want to fight with you what are you talking about you dont even know me what by attacking me what is this im not playing a game now what it was its alright it was a long time ago she died in a car accident alright what about me wasnt i just talking about me you know youre not the easiest person in the world to get close to no but im open to distractions why doesnt that scare you i know you didnt i know it was bad relax youre not why i just wanted to know if youre involved with anyone let me ask you something do your colleagues know if youre involved or not very good spoken like a true psychologist when confronted with the prospect of your own reality hide behind quotations what is that masters and johnson are you going to tell me you didnt feel something in there you mean like in the steam room im just curious okay so tell me about yourself are you married do you what about you arent there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry take your average cop they deal with death everyday if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement oh but it is hes killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him thats a game it has rules and objectives in a way i think its interesting it wasnt intentional its going to be a long night it could take hours before we know something you should try to eat you sure you dont want to eat something she could be dead now i cant right now ive got a game i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down did you think it was going to be easy you think he was going to lay it out at your feet no you didnt what are you looking for getting too hot in here for you each circumstance requires a different tactic are we talking about me or chess it is i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation i see this is going to be a very polite conversation what shall we discuss the weather movies if youre asking me if im passionate about what i do the answer is yes without passion nothing moves us whats your passion chess is a reflection of life life is violent the strong win the weak perish not really you see your goal and you go after it anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed when i was very young yes uh huh no i dont how come you dont stay with them yes sorry i thought it was empty well you should be because this time im going to win youre getting sloppy

no ill do better than that ill show it to you scientifically but its demonstration purely in the interest of science you understand what points women talk too much to tell a woman not to talk is like telling jesse james not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle and samson the strongest man that ever lived was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms sure ill speak to your class but im a hard man on women you want to know why what is my family here yet the way i feel i ought not to go out there today in fact im going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself thats all a part of the white mans big maneuver to keep us fighting amongst ourselves against each other im not fighting anyone thats not what were here for what did i tell you about assuming since when do you start telling sister betty my business since when she has nothing to do with this you tell me not her not anybody else so now we have no opening speaker why wasnt i informed last

situation you created so if you wan na throw bad looks somewhere throw em at a mirror and im very sad about that but some fellas are lucky and some aint we aint taking him to a hospital well thats that then i mean i was worried about mug shot possibilities already but now he knows what you look like what your first name is where youre from and what your specialty is they aint gon na hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out thats it right you didnt tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection one question do they have a sheet on you where you told him youre from oh i dont doubt is was quite beautiful and what was tellin him your name when you werent supposed to why you didnt tell him your name did ya well i guess we drop him off at the hospital since he dont know nothin about us i say its his decision well joe aint gettin here were on our own now i dont know a goddamn body who can help him so if you know somebody call em assuming we can trust joe how we gon na get in touch with him hes supposed to be here but he aint which is making me nervous about being here even if joe is on the up and up hes probably not gon na be that happy with us joe planned a robbery but hes got a blood bath on his hands now dead cops dead robbers dead civilians jesus christ i tend to doubt hes gon na have a lot of sympathy for our plight if i was him id try and put as much distance between me and this mess an humanly possible you got ta idea spit it out well first things first staying heres goofy we got ta book up we cant take him to a hospital he scared the fuckin shit outta me i thought he was dead fer sure so what is it so is he dead or what i got ta take a squirt wheres the commode in this dungeon look asshole im right somebodys a fuckin rat how many times do i hafta say it before it sinks in your skull now youre using your head for all we know hes the rat oh you and joe go back a long time i known joe since i was a kid but me saying joe definitely couldnt have done it is ridiculous i can say i definitely didnt do it cause i know what i did or didnt do but i cant definitely say that about anybody else cause i dont definitely know for all i know youre the rat so whos the rat this time mr blue mr blonde joe its joes show he set this whole thing up maybe he set it up to set it up no shit what then where is everybody i say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house we aint got the slightest fuckin idea what happened to mr blonde or mr blue they could both be dead or arrested they could be sweatin em down at the station house right now yeah they dont know the names but they can sing about this place i mean that could be happening right now as we speak the cops could be in their cars drivin here this minute no theyre not in the car no i dont have them on me ya wan na go with me and get em yes we can go right now but first listen to what im telling you we were fuckin set up somebody is in league with the cops we got a judas in our midst and im thinkin we should have our fuckin heads examined for waiting around here i got em all right i got the diamonds nope yeah and that was a fucking miracle but if they did get away where the fuck are they what do i think i think the cops caught them or killed em at that point it became every man for himself as far as mr blonde or mr blue are concerned i aint got the foggiest once i got out i never looked back did ya see what happened to anybody else i think hes a sick fuckin maniac were awful goddamn lucky he didnt tag us when he shot up the place i came this fucking close to taking his ass out myself everybody panics when things get tense everybody panics everybody i dont care what your name is you cant help it its human nature but ya panic on the inside ya panic in your head ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic then you get a grip and deal with the situation what you dont do is shoot up the place and kill everybody i dont wan na kill anybody but if i got ta get out that door and youre standing in my way one way of the other youre gettin outta my way could you believe mr blonde no real people tagged a couple of cops did you kill anybody shot my way out everybody was shooting so i just blasted my way outta there dont tell me your name i dont want to know i sure as hell aint gon na tell ya mine im telling ya it wasnt that soon they didnt let their presence be known until after mr blonde went off im not sayin they werent there im sayin they were there but they didnt move in till mr blonde became a madman thats how i know we were set up you can see that cant you mr white the cops didnt show up after the alarm went off they didnt show till after mr blonde started shooting everyone thats not correct why not im cool what the fuck am i doing here i felt funny about this job right off as soon as i felt it i should said no thank you and walked but i never fucking listen every time i ever got burned buying weed i always knew the guy wasnt right i just felt it but i wanted to believe him if hes not lyin to me and it really is thai stick then whoa baby but its never thai stick and i always said if i felt that way about a job id walk and i did and i didnt because of fuckin money well you better start thinking about it cause i sure as fuck am thinking about it in fact thats all im thinking about i came this close to just driving off whoever set us up knows about this place there couldve been cops sitting here waiting for me for all we know theres cops driving fast on their way here now you even doubt it i dont think we got set up i know we got set up i mean really seriously where did all those cops come from huh one minute theyre not there the next minute theyre there i

four minutes before they can realistically respond in one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there all loaded for bear all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing and they were all just there remember that second wave that showed up in the cars those were the ones responding to the alarm but those other motherfuckers were already there they were waiting for us you havent thought

teresa banks jack said you knew her how well say no more how come jack lets you work here thanks sam for the good work you have a good eye for detail faulty wiring i dont take it sam i give it hes not the murderer but hes a bozo my guess is there isnt enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring but we should do a blowup of this anyway take a look at this you better dust this place sam she must have known someone no sam im speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park i think thats a good idea its late sam were not you and i are going to get some food what is it accidental oh cole said she was 17 sure but lets finish up with this first i dont know sam thats good thats what i heard gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation he talks loud and he loves his code what thats just gordons bad taste very good but i cant tell you about that gordon said you were good the tailored dress is our code for drugs did you notice what was pinned to it right which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation let me ask you something stanley did you notice anything about the dress not coles uncle but probably the sheriffs uncle in federal prison her face had a sour look that means were going to have trouble with the local authorities they are not going to be receptive to the fbi lil was wearing a sour face ill explain it to you do you remember lils dance were heading into a difficult situation sort of shorthand code if you work with gordon you learn that right awaysee what what are you talking about bobby didnt kill anybody what what say anything you want i know you love me and i love you you always hurt the ones you love oh laura what is wrong with us we have everything what do you mean what the hell is wrong with you whats going on what about tonight this afternoon ive got to see you

neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house where were you laura i didnt see you no yes yes guy just pulls up out of the blue i mean what is this world coming to were late to get to your mother no you havent met him have you met him a special friend who was that your hands are filthy look there is dirt way under this fingernail let me see sit down sit down are you hungry school hi

right who am i soon how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me aboutyou are here and there is no place to go the later events have never been kept a secret someone else has it nowno sir we did not take a look at this chet and i found it under teresa banks ring fingernail no one couldve found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this i cracked the whiteman case with this oh alright you know i liked agent desmond he had his own mo agent chet wouldnt tell me what the blue rose meant did gordon show you a woman named lil agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time he had me drive the van with the body back here which we did it was 105 miles we do notice things dont we agent desmond are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose esthetics are subjective arent they agent desmond im sam stanley if you ever need me one thing that has been troubling me that lamp at the diner do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring when he says discussion how do you take that agent desmond yes he is like a clown i couldnt help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer you did think that didnt you agent desmond may i see the magnifying glass agent desmond there doesnt seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring shes wearing a ring ill get my kit she lived alone in that case we should go to the canyon trailer park are you speaking to me in a code i doubt it was drugs more likely a problem with a nerve i could recheck the arm for injuries but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland its not late its early really early agent desmond its yes its been several hours since weve eaten i didnt realize that so much time had past did you agent desmond geez agent desmond its threethirty in the morning where are we going to sleep it is a piece of paper with the letter t imprinted on it take a look agent desmond would you hold the finger for me theres something up there there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand crushed skull probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age maybe later we could take a look yes it is good what do you think is in these other drawers no one could find those splinters without a machine like this and no one had a machine like this solved the whiteman case with this it must be a high priority situation i see he does talk loud why couldnt he have just told you all these things what did gordons tie mean a blue rose the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in it wasnt her dress or she must have lost some weight so the sheriff had got an uncle whos committed a serious crime oh the uncle is missing what do you mean how do you figure shorthand really code ive heard a lot about this that was really something that dancing girl what did it meani want you in dr gardners office at nine oclock youre out of control

i was born my father taught me about the training about finding the slayers reading the signs theres a small cluster of us a few families really most of the neighboring villagers think were just a bunch of harmless old loonies i thought so myself for a time when i was younger im sorry im not supposed to i shouldnt go on like this its what i was raised to do there arent many of us left the watchers not if youre careful five what did you think that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a slayer do you know how many girls ive trained to be slayers five five properly prepared

inexorably connected to them well cover it later yes they travel about usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork the vampires find a community and they feed on it make it their own you were difficult to trace and i think the process has gone a lot further than id anticipated usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy but for some reason nobody here

another but hes so drunk he misses again an hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar well now the duck of death is good as dead cause this time corky does right an aims real good no hurry some folks did call old corky two gun but not because he was sportin two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried an the only insultin he done was stickin that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on well one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows whats happening bob takes a shot at him and misses on
