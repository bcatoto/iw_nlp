still has use of his motor functions actually these tests werent available twenty years ago nine ten and youre awake open your eyes dammit its worth a shot i can arrange a controlled meeting a careful dose of sedatives for jason some security you and i monitoring evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck no more missing father complex youd be surprised how often they are plenty who knows maybe hes got severe coping problems about not having a father did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friends dad if i had to guess id say the blackouts are stress related unfortunately weve got nothing to work with its harder playing detective now well the good news is that the results are negative ive found no evidence in the way of lesions hemorrhaging tumors it could be extremely useful to jog his memory see if he remembers anything new the next day and ill have the test results back in a few days a journal just have him write down everything he does look andrea im sure hell test negative for brain disorders but theres something else you can try to monitor his memory hold it hold it andrea lets not jump to conclusions ill run some preliminary tests see what we can rule out and you say he doesnt remember any of it you remind me of your father he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one think evan youve invented a disease that doesnt exist alternate universes with colleges prisons paraplegia books hey evan whats the big rush we dont meet for another hour this is where were finding most of the hemorrhaging the outer lining of the cerebral cortex its a little complicated i havent seen results exactly like these before the car doesnt vanish evan the movie in your head has broken thats all but now ive respliced it and i

reforma and the freeway junction in 45 minutes an autosequestra kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse im sure he thought shed sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv it didnt work out that way everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity they planned it samuel and kalfus because i was already dead if something happened my reaction would be to fight to protect her i have skills in that respect pinta would benefit by the fact that im a soldier sorry it is serious mrs ramos look maybe this isnt going to work maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone more sociable youre paying me to protect her not amuse her right no well be okay once she realizes im not a new toy the foods fine sometimes i dont eat im fine never so are you its war the weakest suffer the mostcreasy id have liked to have known you under different circumstances you have no interest in making things easy do you no but i have to admit i thought about

policemen who kills you his family will have all they want my country needs justice proper justice gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence they need to be brought to trial dealt with properly then people will respect the law when they see it works it galls me to watch you you can do as much in days as i can in years men like the the dreamer are protected out of everyones grasp it seems but yours my family lives in miami because of the death threats he was one of the original founders of le hermanidad in the days when it represented good not evil the same thing as you except my reach isnt as long as yours my father was a policemen did you know that the last few days may represent the best police work of my life sit creasy everything that happens from now on does so with my permission really you wont find a better carne asada in all of mexico hombre en fuego man on fire thats what the papers have named you all these photos you just saw were of policemen sadly theyre protected la hermanidad the brotherhood no it would be convenient but no you have a rather checkered past mr creasy your interpol file is six pages long believe it or not youre safe here the judicial police will kill you if they can this page hes the man the boss my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots we had to inject the whole barrio we bugged the house and stole the picture of him i should start going for your tits first a beautiful circle you only fuck me to get information i think hes magnificent when you talked to him did he look sane is it true creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday its a moral issue on one hand youre cleaning up the bad guys but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys i know this your point we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings including the little girl the same man the dreamer listen to this hell die of his wounds bleed to death before he can do anything is that good or bad and they took that away what was she to creasy then i plan to ill even help him if i can hes going to lead me to the the dreamer someone i want very badly but id like to understand him give me that this is my jurisdiction i want these men as much as creasy does what happened to him what happened to creasy you and creasy both a two man army according to interpol panama lebanon with the druze desert storm where you were contracted by the us army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders you two were a married couple yes but if i traced creasy to you others will do it as well their facilities are as good as my own if not better you helped him get this job i read the file you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together tell me about your friend creasy pollo pibil chicken and chorizo sausage hmmmh they marinate it in lemon and orange juice its a stew really so am i im sure he isnt though hes certainly adept at killingdifferent door not far from here i know its old

uhhuh so youre going to stop acting well you waited for good reason and you proposed to christine for some good reason so i think its great its time youve got to have your eyes open thats all i mean look at me i thought victoria and i were set for life whoa not with the wine list these people have we dont want to hold back its not even a mile hey jack hurry up are you chewing gum yeah that would be a good move usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities but this ones pretty damn good this is the new one right chris now thats what you do with every one now set your glass down and get some air into it what do you smell now tip it what youre doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim tells you how old it is among other things usually more important with reds this is a very young wine so its going to retain its color pretty solidly now stick your nose in it depends on the varietal just get a sense of it thick thin watery syrupy inky amber whatever first take your glass and examine the wine against the light youre looking at color and clarity good yeah it is a rose only this one is rather atypically made from 100 pinot noir now were talking doesnt have to be now lets go taste oh jesus look at some point we have to find out because its going to make a big difference yeah but how are they making the salmon poached with a yogurtdill sauce teriyaki curry so whatd you guys finally decide on for the menu thanks jack so do i here we are i like all varietals i just dont generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation these guys make topnotch pinot and chardonnay one of the best producers in santa barbara county look how beautiful this view is what a day you know what lets take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first jack this week is not about me its about you im going to show you a good time were going to drink a lot of good wine play some golf eat some great food enjoy the scenery and send you off in style and lexapro yes i went on monday but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer im working on it id rather have a knife its not worth it you pay too big a price its never free as if shed even be attracted to guys like us in the first place shes a kid jack i dont even look at that stuff anymore this saturday mom remember we told you let me show you something the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released you keep pressure on it so you dont um seventy something its her birthday tomorrow and i dont feel right driving by her house and not stopping in okay itll just take a second shes right off the freeway i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother ive just got to make one quick stop wont take a second there is no new ending page 750 on is exactly the same how about the new ending did you like that and did you read the latest draft by the way color in the red wines comes from the skins this juice is free run so theres no skin contact in the fermentation ergo no color jesus dont ask questions like that up in the wine country theyll think youre a moron 100 pinot noir single vineyard they dont even make it anymore you know how long ive been begging to take you on the wine tour i was beginning to think it was never going to happen yes absolutely despite your crass behavior im really glad were finally getting this time together thats a 1992 byron its really rare dont open it now ive been saving it dont open that now its warm its a long shot all right and conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway im not getting my hopes up ive stopped caring thats it ive stopped caring and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor she was supposed to hear something this week but now its next week and its always like this its always a fucking waiting game ive been through it too many times already no i didnt what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum why did you tell them my book was being published okay there was a tasting last night but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up check out the box i cant help the traffic its miles listen i dont know if you even care but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things turned out the way they did i think youre great maya always have from the first time you waited on me and while im at it i guess you should know that my book is not getting published i thought this one had a chance but i was wrong again dont bother reading it youve got better things to do so you see im not much of a writer im not anything really the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand were leaving in the morning and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you im sorry im really sorry and i havent been with anyone since my divorce this has been a big deal for me maya hanging out with you and last night i really like you maya and im not jack im just his his freshman roommate from san diego state oh maya no please believe me i was even on the verge

yeah i stopped by for a drink didnt see you hope you like it feel free to stop reading at any time ill take no offense um did you still want to read my novel good so did i got it bathroom over there yeah like what i dont know why are you into wine i mean cabernets can be powerful and exalting but they seem prosaic to me for some reason by comparison how about you sure my palates kind of shot but from what i can tell id dub it pretty damn good i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car its not fully proofed but if youre okay with a few typos so you want to work for a winery or something someday horticulture wow i didnt know there was a college here a paper yeah thanks mrnmm yeah but not really it shifts around a lot like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbegrillet mystery you know with no real resolution um yeah but its more the day after yesterday well its a little difficult to summarize it begins as a firstperson account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke kind of based on personal experience but only loosely yeah definitely yeah i know its kind of weird out of context who me nah id just fuck them up that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids is she sleeping or is this stephanies kid sure is cute yeah id say youre right on the money wow we got ta give it a moment but this is tasty really good how about you what was the bottle that did it how long have you been into wine i dont know special occasion with the right person it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary yeah i know not much of a collection really i havent had the wallet for that so i sort of live bottle to bottle

shes buried her body turned up in a minnesota cemetery they brought her back you heard hi there dylan here got a sister like this what they call it anal thats her shows over boys nobody home and its getting dark im not going to run this into the night eddie were walking in everything covered i sent a female in the room in question was rented by an anglo cash since then nothing no activity no phone response down the road a piece is the golden sunset the notell motel socorros contribution to international relations the cars just sitting there no activity ive had a couple hispanic officers casing it all day want to take a look no bad news you know the be on the lookout you asked me to send on the diner car we got a hit on it a little town on the border socorro we got it staked out you interested whats the bad news mack this is sheriff dylan i just assumed she ran away happens a lot around here look around this place is an invitation to run away who knows her name is karen sumpter from near dell city just disappeared a couple weeks back vanished i know how the feds like to sit on information i got something in the car to show you nine bodies in roswell now this its getting a little hairy huh thats right jan ten miles back on the texas side well the victim was killed at the turnaround over there then his car was pushed over here right across the state line that makes it federal this is officer wallace hes out of alamogordo fellas name is harold speck travelin man out of roswellthis could all be a coincidence but you know something i dont believe in coincidences thats why i came back do you think the unsub were not going to mention the word zorro met harold speck online dont say that dont even think that the next thing well be hearing about zorro killer in the media this hasnt gotten out has it he said it was a clue lets take a look at it drop off my stuff at the hotel after youre done here you have the photo from the diner whats with the eyelids what about his killer mackelway i could understand he is overemotional by nature but you agent kulok you had a shining career in front of you what are you doing another what what smarter than us we didnt know speck was a serial the police didnt know his wife didnt know so how did the killer know chuck hello this is agent kulok she has a background in medical forensics dick lows a killer too hawkins isnt the target richard lows the target well wait get online with low inform him of zeros route well set a trap for him have you told richard low about amarillo hes got you believing in zero now too as far as the public knows richard low is dead and he will stay dead until we kill him watch out for dick low hes a liar he has his own world there was a junior agent in seattle not unlike you an agent who fell under dicks spell hed have done anything for agent low richard got this agent to take a suspect to the crime scene beat him up force a confession all unauthorized all illegal the agent died that night killed by the suspect richard low got him killed worst of all we had to hush it up let the suspect go the suspect was george sheldon the second man richard killed there was talk of a file photo that breaks my confidentiality stipulation im told youve asked for a bureau crosscheck of flight records to and from el paso ft myers omaha the murman murder time frames you didnt tell anyone where you were why did you go to chicago i want to catch dick low more than you can imagine but i can not risk going public what happens when the media finds out that a former fbi special agent a founder of the behavioral sciences unit is not dead but instead alive and killing people not ordinary people but even worse serial killers making him some sort of white knight vigilante you keep at it well find him well find him in our own way how do you send out an apb on a dead man were waiting for trace evidence results on the rice killing collected shoes too it was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact suspect zero came to represent every killer dick low had not caught the idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine for someone like low there would always be a suspect zero we couldnt let richard go where that idea was taking him i suspected but you were the one low contacted thats why i brought you back here both in the last year i suspected only someone as brilliant as dick low could find these guys look whatever daitz told you nobody wanted to strip richard of his badge you have to get close to be good at what he did the trick is not to get too close dunlevy said there was another case ron rice in fact there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered the second was george sheldon i didnt enter it into vicap ill get you the file we had every reason to believe he was on that plane he was supposed to be on the plane everything was incinerated it was two weeks before we reached the crash site we the director and i decided it was in everyones best interest to declare dick low dead that way he could exit a hero that gasbag i can imagine what he said im not ashamed to admit that most of what i know about criminal profiling started with richard low i have also over the years i admit taken credit for many of his accomplishments he was the most brilliant law enforcement individual i ever met murman was the alter identity of william heirens the original catch me before i kill again killer short for murder man it was the case that got richard low and i started in this field mack the mouth at a loss for words i dont believe this okay harold speck who goes first you feeling okay agent mackelway i always meant to ask what is it that makes you so special why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers why you ill take it into consideration you didnt like anyone looking over your shoulder why was that what were you doing agent mackelway youre going to get your wish youre going back to washington i want you back in computer crimes fire up those chat rooms the cut on your arm mind if we remove the bandage do you think he singled you out agent kulok and i were in ohare when we heard how do you feel agent its called insubordination you refused to comply with a direct order the federal bureau of investigation is not based on personal preference we share information i might point out agent mackelway the reason we havent been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us which is also why you were reassigned ill relay this to ciiac from the grave who this better be important shut the fuck up or ill shut you up listen to this guy can you believe this hell never change born a liar first word out of his mouth was a lie make up a story always a story any goddamn story to save his ass you are so fucked up youre a disgrace to law enforcement to the bureau and to me dont you touch him thank you rangers put this man in the unmarkedtesta besides that was this him does koessler know about the suspect zero theory pacific northwest is a hotbed for serials no have you had a chance to think about i want the autopsy report where is it minnesota you have the body what i want to talk about the karen sumpter case sheriff dylan this is fbi agent thomas mackelway remember me tape it off well want to finetooth comb it my guess is that the unsub is having us on he checks in pays picks up the key but never walks inside tell me if im wrong the room keys in the car on the seat lets take a look what does the manager say hey sheriff im on my way you tell me oh jesus sheriff i am sorry i meant to call you i got distracted the sumpter girl was not one of specks victims thats the good news agent mackelway this isnt in our database youre thinking id appreciate it if you kept this to yourself i hope that wasnt a joke because i can assure you from personal experience the fbi does not have a sense of humor wheres the nuevo american diner excuse me a salesman gets done in his car and you call the fbi you run the plates we need to run this through vicap search for similar burns turn the body over there was something in the autopsy report yes here these burn marks im sorry this wont take long put a bolo out on that what kind he was sitting here how did you know he was a construction worker what did he look like the man who was with him he was a construction worker youre as crazy as he is hes right you dont give a damn about saving lives at all fuck you theres a killer out there we know who he is he could be stalking now what about zero darryl hawkins i cant the chat room isnt open for another five days i need to get to amarillo immediately i understand in ft myers before your instruction nowhere else sir i didnt use lows name i was looking for a pattern an oversight sir i apologize i felt i needed to get away for a day the pressure paid for my own ticket i was visiting an old college friend huh sir we need to put out an ncic inquiry i got a look in testas computer his screen name was imelda have to give him that had a sense of humor what did you think of the suspect zero theory you knew the arm slash was not zorro how long ago you suspected all along suspected he was alive thats why you came to el paso was i spoke with lloyd daitz im hesitant to nothing concrete nothing id well nothing had trouble sleeping last night sir they like my stories they like the way i think theyre into fantasy i turn them on what i do requires confidentiality if my reporting agent could be someone outside computer crimes perhaps agent kulok this time sir if i may be so bold would it be possible to set up my equipment outside ciiac perhaps in military housing at quantico i didnt get along very well with the other members of the division we thought differently go ahead no just coincidence he knew who i was of course he had my id did he keep it he got away i had him he got away pretty embarrassed to be honest i had him then why do i still have a badge i was lucky to find much less crack the address code no way to be sure i could have done it again let some bythebook j edgar agents go into the chat room spook these guys with stupid questions blow my cover no way i had gotten their trust we were sharing fantasies i couldnt risk it they dont know how to crack these secret chat rooms mydick speck harold speck i think i talked to him look sorry dont say a word i know this is improper ive been trying to speak with deputy director koessler i left a message i must speak with you before you go back to washington im going to amarillo get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years weve got three disappearance cities and dates three parallel discovery cities get into the mainframe let it crunch this information zero abducts victims all over the country kills them keeps them refrigerated for days weeks even months then buries them hundreds thousands of miles away karen sumpter was buried washed up in a flood evans was buried when we get zero well find boneyards all across the country jaime ive got to take a piss i havent changed anything damn but it was your idea use zero you said use zero to get low thats what koessler wants us to believe to discredit low low calls him suspect zero burn marks the original me listed it as burn residue same place the outer thigh as karen sumpter the unsub is able to abduct kill transport and bury without detection yeah of course hardly anyone calls me tom everybody calls me mack i always liked that but why this pattern jaime do you think when this is all over when were in different divisions you think maybe you and me we could try again i got an autopsy report from el paso that doesnt seem right a girl on lows list karen sumpter were getting a court order to exhume to body id like you to come and look at it dont worry ive cleared it they say richard low is wrong but because of him women innocent women are alive who would be dead its too late for that ive gone ahead of the curve on this one theres no turning back when this is over koessler is going to be right or low is going to be right or im going to be right but not all of us ive decided to investigate lows plane crash while im at it i thought id look at the cases koessler worked with low probably i told him koessler had ordered the report kept it secret i need something tangible to hook him i told him id found the confidential file on the suspect zero theory you were right he found me i met with richard low these are names of missing persons he has flagged im doublechecking every case but i dont want to be too obvious about it i marked the ones id like you to work on i guess im a little paranoid thats a crackpot theory everybody says so start killing people for real my watch he toyed with me he sent me to chicago whats up jaime where are you dont confuse what we do with who we are not the way i can i found a peephole into deviant world im gon na reach in and yank some of those creeps out whats that thats true oh i cant they trust me they accept me ive got their confidence you did no jaime i apologize i didnt i had no right to speak to you like that murman and imelda had been slipping into a private chat room low had poor old testa drooling on the keyboard abduction fantasies voyeurism mutilation teasing him with fetish elements he is very good i think its safe to say richard low is murman did they disconnect testas computer you mean the tattoo jesus we got an unsub walking around with four feet find the feet not about coming to see daitz what did you tell him does koessler ask about me i know intraagency fraternizing oh yeah i forgot why did koessler assign you as my liaison you must really think im a square a computer nerd when you were his student did he come on to you i saw him on a talk show once talking about these killers like they were his friends not the victims not the families of the victims he doesnt talk about them blood money thats what it is did he hit on you i ever get like that just take me out in back and shoot me thats because hes a fucking wacko never met a selfpromotion scheme he didnt like whats he doing now none cant find a thing nothing on file nothing online its not a part of any known killers signature every cop has a story and every story has a girl the girl in my story was fifteen yearsold she wore a pink angora sweater i can still see it one day she disappeared i told the police she wouldnt run away i told them who to look for but i was just a kid i sat in the police station crying and crying my parents took me home the girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher id had he kept her alive a week before he killed her the police could have saved her every time i see a photo of a victim i see her thats what i want to do i want to save her take it to the next level what are his fantasies what turns him on what kind of pornography does he like if he could act out his fantasies what would he do imagine yourself one of his victims realizing your life is in his hands what is he thinking he thinks he looks young look at this fellow or this one whats that i was interested in two things computers and crime they sort of came together people end up in occupations for a reason they may think not but they do occupations define us taking a stryker saw cutting off the top of someones cranium pulling the brain out whats that a day in spring chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims i went live last month no no no most of them i used to think all of them are just fantasists guys who get off telling degrading stories when i came across this fugitive chat room listened in i started to think some might actually be real that theyd gone live the challenge was to figure out which was which then i had my disagreement with koessler working the net isnt that different from ordinary undercover work you go into the community walk their walk talk their talk gain their confidence the other reason thats the beauty of the system this is a fugitive chat room it moves from place to place chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours a gardening website chaucer buffs a dating service a pre arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms thats where i stumbled across it notifying friends to meet at a certain time usually midnight to three eastern standard at a certain website a deserted chat room say how to plant perennials come tuesday twelve am bingo these likeminded deviates log on and start yakking it up explicit sex crime gossip who did what to whom who wants to do what when why and how setting up technically anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address but by using punters a correspondent literally punts his address around the world through computers in countries that have no communication treaties the correspondent becomes ghosted invisible the man knew how to dress yes i do wheres my watch its gone that informations being withheld from the media this is no random killing no one shot deal the unsub has killed before hes good at it so what do we have we have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills a serial killer of a serial killer and who wants the fbi to know he exists yeah you know the vics car he was killed this side of the state line the car then pushed across the border this by an unknown subject presumably the killer who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot which may or may not have been accidental why did he come out here whats going on you work with koessler how long have you been downtown the academy then ciiac maybe i shouldnt put it that way im on my best behavior ive got to watch what i say they sort of got me on shit detail no offense yeah yeah you you went by the book maybe you should back off those were just fantasies it was the mall who told you about her i already have an employer you knew it was me all along how do you know whos real and whos not daitz hinted it existed it was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms zero killed them all the file however was kept open after your death npe disappearances no plausible explanation were sometimes filed there deleted if the bodies were found agent lows theory of suspect zero the undetected serial killer is delusional the product of good intentions paranoia and obsession i dont carry it with me so you went underground suspect zero what was your weakness sir hes moved on to tv ive been reading hearing about you i spoke to koessler professor daitz i believe it is you sir who has us jumping through hoops yes sir yes who are you how did you know speck was a killer leave this room ill go back with you blow your cover i want to go live with you george sheldon the second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings the crime scene profile was never entered into vicap at whose request david koessler not everything is imputed to memory the most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy why would the zero file be kept secret ive located the suspect zero file did you know there was one koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation i want to help you lets talk about zero lets go someplace private murman i have something for you havent had any but im willing to try if i owe i will go ive been to chicago lead the way murman something came up murman my man whatever happened to mydick lionheart here im back sorry about the absence i had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel deputy director koessler doesnt want zero all he cares about is low i dont think you understand this man hawkins has killed dozens of people suspect zero locate a jet were going to amarillo now mr hawkins when last in amarillo where did you get gas how far is amarillo he wants us to know hes out there what hes doing its not enough just to kill somebody like speck he wants us to know he did it i talked to him eight nine months ago when i was at computer crime i got into a chat room with someone named mydick id talked to him before everything i saw yesterday everything in the autopsies its identical the forensics are dead on mydicks fantasies involved a hogtie rig nylon cord torture with pliers rip the nipples when the item screams she chokes he had a thing about eyes always the eyes stab their eyes its the same guy speck was mydick mydick as in my dick that was his screen name no koessler headed there now the same shift will be on at noon yes sir i like working for the bureau sir i like catching bad guys its all i care about i wished to be reinstated at computer crimes i was undiplomatic in my request four hundred and sixty sir i screwed up twice sir updating the condition of all bureau owned vehicles in the southwest sector sir thomas mackelway i believe its in my file sir yes sir good morning sir agent salinas sir its over for you hes a brilliant man brilliant enough to catch you im agent thomas mackelway fbi there is no way you will escape assistant deputy director richard low is en route with another agent you may know low by another name you may know him by the name murman i am lionheartwhat do you mean ask me ask me anything sure its crazy out there young girls wearing mini this and mini that sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman she makes me feel like im bothering her she stares down like shes afraid to look at

of you held each other when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine when your parents were out and the two of you were alone completely alone in that big house i meant later when you two took naps did you get an erection you felt pleasure what else im only asking questions did you touch her did you take off her clothes did you take off your clothes walter what did you do while taking a nap with your sister im sorry i shouldnt have been there all right did you and your sister often take naps together a nap and what are you doing but roughly how old how old are you and your sister where

crazy have you talked to carlos about your concerns what are you afraid will happen then why are you talking about this you have no feelings for your niece how do you feel about that because if you

answer and why dont you like coming here but you dont like coming here be honest walter you dont like coming here do you i wish youd give it a try hows the journal then think about it try it by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships our careers and our goals its very good indeed thats right i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect it was just an idea oh it never crossed my mind i dont understand why not thats right id like you to keep a

at the airport not yet its only beginning the traffic where is everyone theyve all gone away one of your suitors i thought that was you up there at home i couldnt face all this traffic vaughan isnt interested in pedestrians i think its badly scarred too from a motorcycle accident no but when hes in that car hes very pale covered with scars it does youre not envious i thought she might come along handling a car again might be more tiring than i imagine is the traffic heavier now there seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident i cant sit on this balcony forever im beginning to feel like a potted plant what about his wife the woman doctor have you visited her yet you should have gone to the funeral after being bombarded endlessly by road safety propaganda its almost a relief to have found myself inan actual accident its about time have you seen it what they brought the car here wheres the car and her husband what was he thats going well then is that a gift from wendel it has an aeronautical feel to it ill listen for you buzzing over they consider this to be the airport hospital this ward is reserved for air crash victims the beds are kept waiting thank you ive been thinking about that about you and karen we were interrupted i had to go back to the set did you come where were you and did you fantasize that vaughan was photographing all these sex acts as though they were traffic accidents and you had sex with all of these men in cars only in cars please finish your story is this part of the act or are they really hurt oh yes i thought he was a medical photographer doing some sort of accident research he wanted every conceivable detail about our crash who is that the announcer do i know him isnt that rather too close the road research laboratory where they simulate car crashes are we imagining it look at all this traffic im not sure i can deal with it so why the airport i take it youre not wearing white to reassure them the airport why are you leaving you havent told me where were going can i give you a lift i somehow find myself driving again i dont think we should have come here im surprised the police dont make it more difficult its not here maybe the police are still holding it their forensic people no thanks ill go with vaughan hard to say youre not jealous are you you have to understand helen and i had this strange intense experience together youre kidding really what kind of exhibition is it what is it i can drive you were the last one i saw just before the accident do you remember we made love theres still a patch of blood there on the road did you see it no where are you he must have driven through a pool of blood if the police stop you again they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood what about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology i thought that was your project its very satisfying im not sure i understand why is that why you drive this car i take it that you see kennedys assassination as a special kind of carcrash you could get your wish at any moment what exactly is your project vaughan book of crashes a medical study a sensational documentary global traffic do you live here with seagrave why are the police taking this all so seriously yesbut it didnt stop i know it didnt stop granny

lans i was worried about you hail in august the crops will be ruined a man can always change things son thats what makes him different from barnyard critters you see son im old and ive lived when a man gets his money in bad ways when he sees the better course and takes the worse then the devil is in his heart and that fixes him wouldnt profit him none why thats just sense son now a man like daniel webster guess they pay him high for what he does but hes worth it and he helps others makes all the difference i figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it son lans id think you was having the baby to hear you well thank the lord you can always depend on new england for weather weve got enough for the whole united states oh go along with you as if it mattered to a grandma but praps you got an even chance it wont be the first baby ever born in this house there made me drop a stitch sit down you make me nervous lans thats the way a man always is thinks his sons

it in the barn hey hush up such talk jabez well make him keep quiet whats ailing that dog all right son if it helps thats a word youre too free with lately jabez consarn this and consarn that i just figgered knew you didnt have enough bills not on the sabbath you wont jabez now jabez stone as for what youre calling hard luck well we made new england out of it that and codfish you know that son jabez what kind of talk is that for the sabbath and me areading the holy word there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil be sure to let me know if daniel is over there ah fiddlesticks you are old enough to know what you are doing so youve made up your mind to go to the party whats that me why look here mary stone im worried about you thats all fox hunting a stone going fox hunting on a week day and the earth crying out for the touch of him shell do nothing of the kind shes going to church with me right away mary ready first bells aringing the new girl jabez says she is from over the mountain yes mrs slossum told me lucy cant even keep a secret selectman my son well who would have thought of that hm hessian gold well hope itll do us more good than it did the hessians let her be son shell do all right you better get yourself straightened out land sakes i dont mind i never did hold much with job even if he is scripture he took on too much to suit me i dont want to malign the man but he always sounded to me as if he came from massachusetts yes mary you go ahead and read well i guess we wont be going to church today mary jabez gentlemen the prosecution rests but mr stone i am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience is this your signature that is highly irrelevant to this case your honor jabez stone did you or did you not sign this document are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract well now mr stone did you make up your mind come come mr stone you are a little upset its not fair to bargain with you now ill give you until midnight mr stone but not one minute more ah then youll come with me indeed im afraid thats hardly the sort of security i was thinking of you see there is that promising little fellow your son suddenly you seem quite desperate mr stone you know im a goodnatured man im always open to reason with a little security i might oh no you violated clause five of our contract and i could collect right now if i chose what a headstrong fellow well i guess youre quite prepared to suffer the consequences trying to break our contract again mr stone small oh i see what you mean why they vary now a man like daniel webster if i ever get hold of him id have to build a special box for him and even at that i imagine the wing spread would be astonishing in your case he was miser stevens soul mr stone yes i am sorry for the disturbance just a minute neighbor stone i promised you money and all that money can buy i dont recall any other obligations but lets look at the contract why mr stone you look so worried can i be of any service oh certainly i shant even come to the christening it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste but i may send a friend of mine just for old sakes sake yes i might do that but you should now that you are becoming a father oh come neighbor stone i wouldnt cut that tree if i were you it means a breach of contract good evening neighbor stone 1840 well thatll take us to the seventh day of april in 1847 yes indeed but not now not for seven years oh i almost forgot what is the date excellent a firm fair signature one that will last till doomsday my dear neighbor stone i congratulate you youre going to be the richest man in new hampshire a pin neighbor stone im afraid youll have to prick your finger but whats a little pain to a lucky man well why should that worry you a soul a soul is nothing can you see it smell it touch it no think of it this soul your soul a nothing against seven whole years of good luck you will have money and all that money can buy upon my word neighbor stone if it werent for my firms reputation for generous dealing thats right mr stone there is just one little formality id like your signature here see and when its done its done for seven years its our usual form of course we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time yes of course people forgot or the men who knew about it died you know how these things happen oh you know the old story the hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to saratoga some of the gold has been buried under your barn a clever man like yourself he can find money anywhere money to pay his bills money for his wife and his children money to be a rich man all he needs is a friend to point it out to him like that of course why man you have one of the richest farms in the county you just go about it the wrong way so many men do hard work well thats all right for people who dont know how to do anything else its all right for people who arent lucky but once youre lucky you dont work for other people you make them work for you youve had a lot of bad luck these days and yet its all so unnecessary when i think of your opportunities do you deny that you called me ive known people in other states who went back on their word but i didnt expect it in new hampshire my congratulations as between two gentlemen your honor gentlemen of the jury this case need not detain us long it concerns one thing alone the transference barter and sale of a certain piece of property to wit his soul by jabez stone that transference barter or sale is attested by a deed i offer that deed in evidence and mark it exhibit a the quick or the dead you have said it may the best man win mr webster very well you shall have your trial mr webster the case is hardly one for an ordinary jury you mean a jury trial and who with better right when the first wrong was done to the first indian i was there when the first slaver put out for the congo i stood on the deck am i not spoken of still in every church in new england tis true the north claims me for a southerner and the south for a northerner but i am neither to tell the truth mr webster though i dont like to boast of it my name is older in the country than yours foreign and who calls me a foreigner there mr webster all open and aboveboard and in due and legal form your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit mr webster if you have no more arguments to adduce ill take him along now talk has never proved that question mr webster cup for cup what do you say oh not that you ever get drunk no indeed but a kind of overpowering lassitude or more plainly a deep and enveloping sleep it even kicked back once at you didnt it scratch will do for the evening may i join you mr webster i presume pretty good thats perfect ill be there too with the presidential election coming up i thought i could be of some help sir its only a short drive mr webster oh thats what you want well you can be perfectly honest with jabez stone now why dont you you can talk to me the loneliness lonely with all your gold mister stevens that hardly makes sense my money why mister stevens what a quaint idea come over to the door i want to speak to you privately stop throwing away that money we mustnt let people see any softness in you mister stevens people take advantage of softness you know come out of there ill give you an extension if youll forget this stupid repentance ideano siree it didnt and it wont no matter what happens just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and union so giddyap constitution and lets keep going mr stone youre wrong mr stone there are people who live and die without eer seeing it they cant see the country for the money in their pockets and some think their states the country or the way they live is the country and theyre willing to split the country because of that well i hope youll meet all those when youre grown youll meet the fireeaters and the circassian beauties thats part of the fair to be sure but if wed had to depend on them in a permanent way the country would have stopped at the allegheny mountains well its high and its wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it its the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new states growing in the west maybe you can sometime daniel im a farmer you know and like to show my farm but the thing id like to show you most youll have to see for yourself no daniel they are not race horses they are good old friends of mine i call em constitution and bill of rights the most dependable pair for long journeys ive got one called missouri compromise too and then theres a supreme court fine dignified horse though you do have to push him now and then it does hurt and dont you do it again daniel dont ever let me catch you doing that again and serve him right and what about daniel webster a varied list of attractions and which would you like to see first danl young man you got me there guess there will if it says so it hasnt opened yet all right daniel jump in hello colonel want a lift breakfast ah come along friends ma stones a cook this side of heaven i know that was mighty queer medford knew it the minute i tasted it but it takes more than that to down daniel webster you were worried jabez werent you oh come man come just because youve sold your soul to the devil that neednt make you a teetotaler theres nothing like it i saw an inchworm take a drop of it once and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee come try a nip then ill just christen the jug with your permission stone somehow or other waitings wonderfully shorter with a jug they make plucky women in new england hm how long have we to wait i see and this is where hed like to collect too its here you said that you closed the deal with him no you havent time you havent time for your mother or your wife or your child im sorry you cant see that i know you could once you made a little speech once that ill always remember and i know the others do too they remember and they see how you have changed thats why they didnt want to come tonight to you jabez youre as blind as a burma bat with your gold pot mind you its not the money ive been talking about its what you make of it theyd have a good neighbor jabez and thats worth much more than anything else much much more you jabez stone you and a lot of poor farmers hereabouts good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you or am i wrong about those contracts mr stone thats just fine neighbor stone but i have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor where i sit i mean you see the whole country sort of has its eye on me jabez anybody in public life has that difficulty even you jabez they watch us carefully our neighbors and our enemies and they see much more than we think they do and understand much more my friends all like to think that ive got the good of mankind always at heart and ive got to make sure that those i deal with have the good of mankind always at heart too do you know what im talking about jabez well ill be if it isnt little mary sampson from franklin eloquent speech neighbor stone couldnt have done better myself under the circumstances thank you heres a man who knows whats good for danl webster medford rum ah a breath of the promised land to the champion of the iron horseshoe jabez stone not at all lad not at all for a good game of horseshoes i would always sacrifice fame and acclaim i dont seem to be so very popular after all in cross corners you win will you ride to the village with me mr stone ten throws it is of course and you tell your father for me we may be on opposite sides of the fence but im always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions as long as people do that the countrys all right do you understand martin well martin i only wear them in washington thats the trouble but if you ever come down there ill show them to you what are you looking for colonel whats your name there is nothing like a good old country breakfast wheres ma ill do my best mary mary what love and trust could do for your husband youve done and frankly in a very few moments this is going to be no place for a lady are you mary well i guess im glad myself seeing as how you feel this way party seems to be quite a success lots of guests anyhow and now come on mary i want to show you the allfired biggest parsnips in the whole united states raised right here in marshfield of course mary youve talked to me as you might have talked to your father and i believe he wants me to help you a little you see sometimes we think were licked in this life but we werent put here to be licked dont you believe it sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us the shadows and the evil but it is still up to us to fight now i was thinking before you came of coming over to cross corners end of the month to get acquainted with my godson and other things you dont have to defend him to me mary ive been called names myself ive heard some odd things about jabez lately he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself yes youve chatted a lot womanlike nibbling around the edge but mary forgive an old lawyers legal mind i dont think you ever once came to the point and there is a point isnt there no you wouldnt youre not the sort of woman thats afraid of smoke or fire but now lets talk about your affairs well she hardly ever comes here shes not the type of woman who cares to live in the country yes im all on my own sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely do you mind if i indulge well mary its too bad i didnt know i would have given you a real dinner but with my wife being in washington have another piece of pie youve got a smart man mrs stone hang onto him why thats different well boys i guess well knock off ive got to see a friend if its the british minister take him around to the pantry and give him some madeira hullooo why you longbarreled slabsided lantern jawed noteshaving crook be off

hampshire men arent a match for the devil wed better give this country back to the indians then i stand on the constitution i demand a trial for my client well i never heard the dev of your claiming american citizenship hm this appears i say appears to be properly drawn but you shall not have this man a man isnt property mr stone is an american citizen and no american citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince not so fast mr scratch produce your evidence if you have it cup for cup there isnt enough medford rum in the whole of new hampshire to make me sleepy me why certainly but be careful mr scratch medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back even with oldtimers like yourself attorney of record for jabez stone might i ask your name say thats pretty good young man id
