an interesting experience two then well drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there first of all were going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens well watch her for awhile id like to hear her sing anyway and then also well know she is there and not in her apartment okay you better get out before someone sees us great ill pick you up around eight oclock is that good first of all well have a nice dinner try to find out where dorothy sings i dont want you to get involved really i mean i do but if something went wrong i mean like you said they may be involved in murder well its friday night and youre a beautiful girl i guess you would have a date that does that you didnt goof it up but you still owe me one i want to sneak in tonight its friday do you have a date tonight

no license plates and you give me at least three minutes i can stall if its more but i need time to find a good window alright lets just try the first part if that goes well well see about the rest no one will suspect us because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this you will be a jehovahs witness i have a few awake magazines for you you dont have to keep her very long a few seconds is all ill need whatiya think right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man i will spray her apartment after a few minutes you will knock on her door drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window alright the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later settle down i have a plan which i think will work there is very little for you to do but i do need your help arent you curious about my plan there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience sometimes in some cases its necessary to take a risk i got to thinking ill bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that womans apartment you know sneak in and hide and observe i guess mikes got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon i dont want to cause any trouble id like to talk to you about something you hungry or thirsty or both yeah good bye i guess ill see you sometime thanks for the tour it was nice talking to you i dont know he moved away its not bad but its bad enough its a lot worse for my father i used

print is dead on earth no but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna i couldnt do that you might hurt someone theyre not guns theyre particle throwers when you were in the bathroom did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly the wet towels residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair the redness in your cheeks indicating were you recently in the bathroom life is just a state of mind no them shoot them cross the beams fullstream with strogon pulse you talked to gozer who yes after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive and he wasnt alone he had close to a thousand followers when he died they conducted rituals bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world of course ivo shandor i saw his name in tobins spirit guide he started a secret society in 1920 oh shit he wants to shut down the storage grid all right peter good night all right ill try i agree some i just met the keymaster hes here with me now venkman are you there does she want to be what is it its hard to explain but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension trust me it will be bad dont cross the beams wait wait theres something i forgot to tell you something was definitely here did you see anything shes telling the truth or at least she thinks she is just for your information ray the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over 75000 im always serious oh this is big peter this is very big theres definitely something here oh youre here that appears to be the case and look at this peter coldriveted girders with selenium cores the storage facility blew this one shut off the protection grid im worried ray its getting crowded in there and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom ive got to sleep neutronize system shut easy easy im going to throw in my trap now ray where are you are you all right wed better adjust our streams i blame myself or even a race memory stored in the collective unconscious and i wouldnt rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact eitheryes sir dont worry we handle this kind of thing all the time did you ever report it to anyone has this ever happened before you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out look at the structure of the roof cap it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies what happened i need two new purge valves hows the grid around the storage facility holding up set entry grid its working god its ugly sorry buddy i just realized something weve never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment you know peter this could be a past life experience intruding on the present the staypuft marshmallow man he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid we used to roast staypuft marshmallows at camp waconda look i couldnt help it it just popped in there forget the trapping just blast him as a dulyconstituted representative of the city of new york and on behalf of the county and state of new york the united states of america the planet earth and all its inhabitants i hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension i dont think its shandor hes listed on the blueprints as i shandor no nobody ever built them like this the architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius the whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy its not good pete boy that was a rough one i dont know im just guessing dont move it wont hurt you sit tight im on my way where are you pete all right lets cool the negative vibes these things can sense them im getting high readings near the air vents it must be using the duct system to get around see i told you wed get something no sense worrying about it now they will how was your date why dont i check out the building it may have a history of psychic turbulence fourteen hundred everybody can relax i found the car how do you like it wow does this pole still work but most people are afraid to even report these things but at nineteen percent interest you didnt even bargain with the guy my parents left me that house i was born there for what purpose do you know what a patent clerk makes i liked the university they gave us money they gave us the facilities and we didnt have to produce anything ive worked in the private sector they expect results youve never been out of college you dont know what its like out there this is like a major disgrace forget mit or stanford now

some pke readings right off the top of the scale buried the needle were close this time i can feel it peter at 140 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue ten people witnessed a freeroaming vaporous fulltorso apparition it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away scared the socks off some poor librarian what do you mean choose we dont understand later man you dont have to worry about that with us sir every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world judgement day and the seas would boil the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesiumtungsten alloy no but i liked jesus style boy solid cores of shielded selenium 325 mmmhmmm uh oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barretts apartment building and theyre

any significant readings yeah yeah damn i know it happened by itself youre quite a housekeeper well lets check it out nothing is that the kitchen thats too bad thanks whats in there no what do i act like yeah but its got a great cello break id have to say prokofievs third concerto you play the cello its my favorite instrument have you ever thought of moving out at least until this disturbance blows over spengler see if you can find the word zuul in any of the literature ill take miss barrett home and check out her apartment its in the stars some people like the attention some people are just crazy so what do you think it was were all professionals here miss hello im peter venkman may i help you i see but why the students love us this is preposterous i demand an explanation i trust youre moving us to a better space somewhere on campus well get back to you back off man im a scientist one thing at a time we dont even know what it is yet yes im dr venkman and this is dr stantz janine im sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry the epa whats he want heres the paper on the brooklyn job she paid with a visa card why dont you step into the office and well talk about it hold all my calls janine or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really biblical proportions mr mayor its a pretty simple choice you can believe mr pecker here the man is a psychopath your honor you turned off the power look there was another man here you have to find him and bring him back a short determinedlooking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie at ease officers im peter venkman i think theres been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can hey make yourself useful go save a tree go ahead get a court order then im gon na sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution why do you want to see it the magic word is please because you didnt say the magic word no you may not yes it would in a storage facility im not at liberty to say you could say that i have phds in psychology and parapsychology yes im doctor venkman great hows it going can i help you then my theory was correct im studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability you volunteered didnt you arent we paying you for this sorry this isnt your day well just 75 more to go whats this one nervous close but definitely wrong good guess but no all right what is it but its my favorite state no you said crossing the beams would be bad itll kill her and us on the count of three one two what now get a grip on yourself egon i talked to dana barrett and she referred to gozer as the destructor gozer she said he was the destructor let me guess gozer worshippers wheres the keymaster if you turn that thing off we wont be responsible for the consequences ill spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning you have to keep him there do whatever you have to but dont let him leave he could be very dangerous yeah yeah i was just thinking it probably wouldnt be a good idea for them to get together at this point i dont think so its more of that gozer thing she says shes the gatekeeper does that make any sense to you im with dana barrett and shes floating three feet off the bed its peter egon ive got a problem what do you mean bad why not what yeah i can smell it didnt see anything didnt get anything nice girl no ghost im starting to worry you said your graph was pointing to something big you told me things were going to start popping generally you dont see that kind of behavior in a major appliance what do you think egon will you guys relax we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade professional paranormal investigations and eliminations the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams wow spengler are you serious about actually catching a ghost egon somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head do you remember that what have you got egon great the marshmallows are about to get their revenge and you came up with that what what popped in there agile bastard isnt he well that ought to do it it doesnt seem to have slowed him down any who was the architect i guess they dont build them like they used to huh egon hows the grid around the storage facility holding up i cant take much more of this the pace is killing me how do you know its here ray its looking at me well hurry up the needles going wild third floor get down here ray somethings here so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy sure each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back no problem so do i do you know when that might be were on the brink of a very serious cashflow problem it wasnt a date it was an investigation good idea were any other words spoken that you remember do you think its wide enough how much this might do i dont know it just seems kind of pricey for a fixerupper dont you think were trying to keep our costs down you know how it is when youre starting a new company maybe but no one ever advertised before youre not going to lose the house everybody has three mortgages these days youll never regret this ray to go into business for ourselves let me tell you ray everything in life happens for a reason call it fate call it luck karma whatever i think we were destined to get kicked out of there youre always so worried about your reputation we dont need the university einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerkthey cant stop progress ray i apologize i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced they did this to galileo too yeah but i introduced you guys you never wouldve met if not for me thats got to be worth something if you guys are right if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow i think i could win the nobel prize oh yeah this could be bigger than the microchip theyll probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us were probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady get her that was your whole plan you call that science hey lady lady can you talk who are you this is not working think of something else what do i say what do we do now it looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly uhhuh ive heard about the rockfall ray i think youve been spending too much time with spengler looked at with your eyes ray as

not from these parts aye afternoon if you send me away now mara ill not come looking for you youre not talking sense mara ill not take that kind of talk from you from those others below maybe but not from you youre sounding like that mad woman widow baggins thats mad surely you dont take their word who so why the crazy talk its a miracle it is saint andrew has smiled on me on us but i did live what are you saying im standing here as real as you i dont understand not a week ago your father gave us his blessing im your future husband remember do you have cause to bothering us far away like you what would you likehes a macleod aye it is his duty all of ours your grandfather wore that in his service to the king and i to fight for the duke ah conor how you look a mandont be stupid lady your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone elses i have witnesses that can put the two of you together what were you doing in felton just for laughs we raided wonder boys house there was a gallon of one of the corpses blood in his carpet i think it was about then i withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year i want taupin but we might just give it the ole college try what with the court back ups it could be days before you got an arraignment but then im sure the flunkout neice of the da knows all about that youve been a busy little beaver especially with that records mess up in church hill your notes are very complete naturally my feelings were crushed when you didnt rush right over and tell us what you knew in fact were considering book ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder but theres more wednesday someone played javelin with the cemetary curator in felton delaware some locals spotted two cars with dc plates and surprise surprise they turn out to be registered to our own brenna cartwright and the ever popular richard taupin all fashionably without heads what are you going to tell them that youre protecting a man whos killed four people you and i should talk first well the man of the hour that we all would like to talk to about now has apparently skipped town and all of a sudden the smithsonians ambulence chaser is an expert on missing persons ive got a morgue filling up with bodies thats my right a murder no i want this to be all ours round up who you can and put them on standby are you sure should have seen him the first night son of a bitch stood there with a quart of blood on his pant leg and didnt even blink any other ids come up yeah i want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff all i need is time look i dont know what the hell youre up to but i think ive got a pretty good idea a neighbor saw your car leave where were you tuesday night for the moment it was covered with mr fasils fingerprints but none of his blood a claymore to be exact you wouldnt know anything about it would you do you know what this is youre wrong what were you looking for lets just say that in my years with this department ive seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th street do you make a habit of hanging out in that neigh borhood at night two days ago a bulgarian national was murdered the same way hed also been in the country less than a week what is your citizenship he was carrying a syrian passport and had been in the country less than a week his name was iman fasil if that jogs your memory did you know the victim mr taupin what were you doing in that alley this your present addressjust your pappy scared some yes sir when you get older your priorities change its the simple things that count without them growing old can be a very lonely thing such a pretty day if i live to be 90 ill never tire of mornings like this mind you im 74 now morning mr north ill send them right up the resemblance is amazing sure take after him never seen a father and son look more alike youre one of williams kids huh oh yes more than enough when your father died i saw to it that the grounds were kept upgo ahead senor i have my friend to keep me company with the proper tools conor a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one you are young inexperienced you do not know what time can do how it can sap all pity all love you must be you have responsibilities you must learn the rules you can never attract attention to yourself never show the side that will draw others to you you will always know when you are in the presence of another beware but more importantly conor macleod will be your battle against time in the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat people will become a transitory pathetic lot the only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent but life without morality without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love is no life at all that is how the others exist nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last keep your soul sewed to the earth do not become one of them i am a small player but if by helping you i can keep that monster from being the last then perhaps my life has meant something this power is divided amongst you me and others like cuts in a pie but the cuts are not equal some like you and he have more much more you have not been fully trained but you will learn and you will be good i can feel that you have apt itude this is why our friend is so concerned it does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds but the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening for it gives you great strength the strength of knowledge the ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be as they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes to feel it to know it is to be in touch with the will of every living thing all living things pay dues conor they must be respected for that point conceeded mr macleod the fabric of life the spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another you have a gift one you must protect it will take less effort as you learn muy bien oh the boy has a mouth now if only he had an arm harder you swing like an impotent cow again try again harder concentrate harder we are brothers and you are a defense of sorts hide run to the ends of the earth till you learn you must learn to defend yourself in this i can help there is an imperfection for all your healing if your head ever leaves your neck you are dead you can survive anything but steel against your threat then it is over the end it is always less with my living far or near but if i were to die the push would become stronger than ever before there is power in this and as long as you and i live the knight can never have it all you recall how i spoke of the push you feel and how i make it less you have done nothing wrong conor macleod you will live survive youd have to die first aqui you are not dead boy accept it three days youve laid there its time you ate it is the truth listen to me hear the words it is as you are we are immortal conor you and i we can not be killed not even a single lifetime you are still so very young some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known the game you and i conor we are different from all others around us you know this you can feel it we are flesh and bone like any man but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure permanently we are brothers you feel you know me does it change with me in the room do you ever feel a flow as if some thing were pushing against you when i was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me all thought i would die or be maimed for life but i healed quickly and like you i paid the price for being different it was time for our paths to cross in my travels i heard the story of the macleod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this earth i was sent by his majesty of spain to inverness as a con sultant on matters of metal you scots have a way with game it still has life in it spirit back home the food is sodomestic hmm que rico what is it you call this first food no a good meal makes conversation so much easier and now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew i should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation and a solution and but for a mark you are well as any man no but you lived your marks would suggest great injury your back it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle please go to no trouble i am from spain and i would like a moment of your time juan cid romirez chief surveyor and alchemist your name is conorit will be horrible the future i may die tomorrow or 10000 tomorrows i can promise you nothing nothing but a moment maybe two but a moment of love is that not worth a lifetime life is only life when it is bounded by death the inheritance is death the gift is the finality of life to be part of the fabric the inside i love you brenna life it is the gift and the under standing of life not power not control the emptyness the years and years of void nothingness bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness who would have guessed ill destroy you ive destroyed everything ive ever touched oh god get out im the last oh christ im the last one i cant stand it oh god i cant stand it be careful dont stay any longer than you have to gettysburgs an hours drive at most you should be back by nightfall all of it finished its all the same half lives that never go away empty and fear fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you it can never last and in the end you always end up destroying both come here brenna i havent killed you there are differences sometimes innocents become involved not the same i didnt kill the watchman perhaps there is something more an inheritance sometimes i think its just for something to do a conquest to be the last something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away some thing to replace the love that can never work he is older than i yes i carried that rifle in world war i this book is a 16th century policy report for the king of austria the diploma is my con ference of degree in latin from trinity college class of 1672 it goes on that would be difficult to explain you are a very perceptive young woman hardly a reason to run off with a murderer i see why are you here you wont a factor of age at least no just the child of some lonely girl i gave a ride to when they died i put them in a grave with my name on it twenty years later i became the son yes yes follow me a little dusty here try this i suppose theyre still making women the same as back then maybe it would do us both good they do it each year yes it will take some time for the forms to clear before you go to gettysburg i wish i could there was a man once just a simple woodcarver but he understood more than anyone he could see to the heart of it it never ends today is the same as the first tomorrow will be the same as today so much time and all of it wasted you love history the less exposure i recieve around government buildings the better you as mrs taupin will attract considerably less attention than i the only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property ive aquired that requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in gettysburg but thats where you come in i go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad mr taupin not all of them richard taupin has become cumbersome it would be best if he just disappeared you are now youve been listening to rumors youre a fool you had to do nothing no one knows youre here he sees me as a threat go home you are being foolish why not im sure theyd love to hear your story have you gone to the police you hes dead whatever i may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now that bothers you not your concern you neednt worry miss cartwright ive been at this a very long time at the moment carl smith where tradition youll be safe here he wont kill in a church i doubt that good day miss cartwright miss cartwright you are involving yourself in matters that do not concern you i strongly suggest you return to washington and stay out of small town cemetaries you have an active imagination i dont know what youre talking about people like that rarely leave business cards probably have you taken to touring small town cemetaries miss cartwright good day miss cartwright all but one out of a hundred i know all left to be led like donkeys back home now if you will please basil the ii miss cartwright unless you have come here to sell the sword theres very little i can help you with now if you will excuse me i have a great deal of work to do its not mine miss cartwright what is it i can do for you yes yes he was my father taught me fish are creatures of habit they like their food where theyre used to it at the top hiding in old leaves here the hook should go just below the head where the meat is toughest answer me he knows im here how and the bulgarian how many came what name is he using where youre wrong ive had a few more concerns how do you do it kahn how do you live so full of life for so long youre insane you were never a kid i havent drunk this much since he found us even there had a great swing with his blade for a pope offered the pope one of his whores neuvich the clown of the crusades its good to see you kahn and have you something to settle with me what are you doing here how did you find me how are you sit kahn leave her alone go to hell tradition whats the point you have me finish it whats the point leave her out of this run of sorts youve been here from the start not so long should i care and if i refuse are you here ive got all the time in the world except right now if you will excuse me lieutenant do you hes mistaken home my condolences a mystery your murder weapon i presume its a sword thats none of your business what are you getting at american it doesnt no i was walking by when i heard a shout your men came right after yes nothing to be sorry about im sure thats true no same when may i expect the cleaners we were very close his only kid the money in the estate was enough to cover your costsin nomine sanctus esperitu auditorium nostrum luceat ei et lux perpetua requiem acernam donaeia moment alone please he never jokes perhaps the professor could use your computer back home we call him the miracle worker i tried to clear things up professor scott i explained youd come all the way from edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at plexico but they dont seem to know anything about it congratulations jim i think youve saved the earth hes coming round jim wake up man wake up tearing of the middle meningeal artery cramps jim youve got to let me go in there dont leave him in the hands of twentieth century medicine oh joy it doesnt look all that different thats crazy i prefer a dose of common sense you are proposing to head backwards in time find humpback whales then bring them forward in time drop them off and hope they tell this probe what to do with itself sure slingshot around the sun if you pick up enough speed youre in time warp if you dont you fry youre really going to try this time travel in this rust bucket now wait just a damn minute no way somebody has to keep an eye on him dammit jim theyve made him into a goddam greenblooded computer are you sure thats what i thought i mean him back at his post like nothing happened i dont know if youd got the whole picture but he isnt exactly working on all thrusters you sure this is such a bright idea i just wish we could cloak the stench youd think they could at least send a ship bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite but to come home in this klingon flea trap it is no spock it means he feels safer about your guesses than most other peoples facts well nobodys perfect guess spock your best guess well youre gon na have to take your best shot naturally so what is your problem you ah you present the appearance of a man with a problem angels and ministers of grace defend us then how you just said there arent any except on earth of the past my god thats crazy who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale i liked him better before he died really you think this is its way of saying hi there to the people of the earth you mean i have to die to discuss your insights on death youre joking spock its me bones i mean our experience was unique you really have gone where no man has gone before cant you tell me what it felt like forget it how bout covering a little philosophical ground life death life things of that nature umm well just wanted to say nice to have your katra back in your head not mine i mean i may have carried your soul but i sure couldnt fill your shoes hi busy my god man drilling holes in his head is not the answer the artery must be repaired without delay or he will die so put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases how do you explain slowing pulse low respiratory rate and coma reading the patients vital signs were just observingnot me bones they did it pavel can you hear me give me your name and rank come on pavel an experimental device doctor what did you say she was getting what do you think spock captain spock and i will attempt to trace these whale songs to their source lets hope so bones mr sulu set us down in golden gate park if you have a better idea nows the time thats the general idea would you prefer to do nothing weve done it before spock start your computations for time warp come on bones lets pay scotty a visit bones stay here bones mr sulu take us home itll come back to him what do you mean we could learn a thing or two from this flea trap it has a cloaking device that cost us a lot mr sulu switch to manual control stabilize energy reserve report helm understood what is your plan ah well done team 2 dr mccoy you mr scott and commander sulu will convert us a whale tank no choice now scotty may fortune favor the foolish mr sulu warp speed shields mr chekov thats odd uhura whats on the comm channels most prudent engine room report scotty im impressed mr chekov a lot of effort for a short voyage well i as they say in your century i dont even have your phone number how will i find you you mean this is goodbye hey where you going you have a point he means our chances of getting home are not very good you might have lived a longer life if youd stayed where you belong mr sulu full power descent you tricked me thank you for everything beam me up scotty i have no time to argue gillian or even tell you how much youve meant to us the frequency you cant our next stop is the 23rd century all i need is the radio frequency to track them gillian would the whales be at sea by now calm yourself nurse scotty get us out of here a spaceship with a missing man damn gone well bring them up just like we brought you its called a transporter beam its all real look the storage tanks for the whales steady now we need your help yes and im glad youre here though ill admit you picked a hellova time to drop in right think about it but dont take too long because im out of time if you change your mind this is where ill be lem me tell you something im here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century if i have to ill go to the open sea to get them but id just as soon take yours better for me better for you and better for them it wouldnt be my first choice no you asked now will you tell me something george and gracies transmitter whats the frequency noon tomorrow then tell me when the whales are leaving you want the details thats what you think okaytruth im from what on your calendar would be the late 23rd century ive been sent back in time to bring two humpback whales with me in an attempt to repopulate the species all right the truth no im from iowa i just work in outer space who do you think i am tell me when the whales are going to be released whats what what do you mean now its not so much a matter of a place as of time hm if you have such a low opinion of my abilities how come were having dinner you know i could take those whales somewhere they wouldnt be hunted flown and thats the last youll see of them how will that be done exactly youre upset about losing the whales so how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist implicitly its his way just a little joke see you later old friend very likely youre not exactly catching us at our best in fact we may be able to help in ways that frankly you couldnt possibly imagine we cant tell you please just let me finish i can tell you that were not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales no maam no dipshit what does that mean exactly take their chances whats going to happen when you release the whales can i ask you something iowa memory problems too thanks we dont want to be any trouble hes harmless back in the sixties he was part of the free speech movement at berkeley i think he did too much lds theres really very little point in my trying to explain back to san francisco i assure you that wont be necessary we were only trying to help how soon whys that its perfect spock a male a female together in a contained space can beam them up together and consider ourselves damn lucky you mean man you got us to the right place spock now all we have to do is get the whales out before we sink mr scott come in scotty damn mr spock see to the safety of all hands spock condition report then where the hell are we spock did braking thrusters fire can we make breakaway speed you spock thats extraordinary mr sulu take the con im taking our guest down to see her whales mr spock have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time reentry program mr spock where the hell is the power you promised me right will you help us is that the logical thing to do spock thank you spock our mission goddam it spock youre talking about the end of every life on earth youre half human havent you got any goddamned feelings about that damn damnit weve been so lucky we have the two perfect whales in our hands but if we dont move quickly well lose them thats cutting it closer than you know what about team two status he meant what you were saying on the tour that if things keep on the way theyre going humpbacks will disappear forever its her from the institute if we play our cards right we may learn when those whales are really leaving i see they have a right to be do you think theyll help us what else did you learn from your mind meld youve done it before cant you remember you dont have to lie you could exaggerate and another thing it is not always necessary to tell the truth well for one thing you havent quite got the hang of it about those colorful metaphors we discussed i dont think you should try to use them spock come on fellah speak up oh the complete works of jacqueline susan the novels of harold robbins you mean profanity thats simply the way they talk here nobody pays any attention to you if you dont swear every other word youll find it in all the literature of the period spock dont call me admiral dont you remember you used to call me jim now whats your question yes simple logic i think well find what were looking for at the cetacean institute in sausalito two humpbacks called george and gracie well spock thanks to your restored memory and a little bit of luck we are in the streets of san francisco looking for a pair of humpback whales how do you propose to solve this minor problem and they will be again spock thats the beauty of it how much where would we find these reactors theoretically but you said toxic explain quite right spock mr chekov engage cloaking device home in on the strongest signal descend from orbit well done mr spock earth but when spock youve programmed that from memory what are the variables surely you can be more specific what is our target in time uhura get me through to starfleet command mr spock your computations but we cant turn away is there no alternative that leaves us no choice we must destroy the probe before it destroys earth is there any other planet where this species exists spock could the humpbacks answer to this call be simulated whales spock where are you going uhura can you modify the probes signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors spock youre suggesting the transmission is meant for life form other than man well i find that understandable i mean youve been through a lot station please jim spock jim remember permission granted lets see what shes got mr sulu ground cushion keep the nose up if you can picture uhura hover on my mark mr sulu mr chekov stand by decloaking scotty ready for power build up mark mr sulu wing to cruise configuration full impulse power uhura scan for the whales 401 megahertz advise reaching 10000 steer threeonezero go mr sulu well divide into teams commanders chekov and uhura are assigned to the uranium problem picture please what is our condition mr sulu mr sulu steady now mr sulu mr sulu we need breakaway speed steady as she goes continue on course chekov any signs of federation escort weapons systems out of control and blind as a bat mr scott how soon estimate range ship to whales on screen put them on screen bearing uhura where uhura you did what was necessary keep trying youll find him any luck everyone remember where we parked well stick together till we get orientated bearing to the whales right now look i want you all to be very careful this is terra incognita many customs will doubtless take us by surprise its a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extraterrestrial before from a city that doesnt make sense on speakers then this is what it would sound like underwater on screen what is it mr sulu systems report communications scotty dont prejudge a ship is a ship go on ahead close the hatch the explosive override the whales on my way ironic when man was killing these creatures he was destroying his own future mr sulu if you please mr scott dont make jokes we are in danger of dont take too long were sitting ducks for their radar systems mr sulu impulse climb well done mr scott how soon can we be ready for warp speed how long scotty scotty are the whale tanks secure mr sulu not good enough scotty youve got to do better oh i see tell them phasers on stun good luck kirk out what is it i thought i told you never to call me i cant believe weve come this far only to be stopped by this scotty is there any way dilithium can be recrystallized give me a round figure mr scott it takes two to tango mr scott youll work it out scotty and remember two of them whales scotty 45 to 50 feet long about 40 tons a piece scotty we have to find some humpbacks that should be enough can you enclose it to hold water scotty how long is this bay appreciated by all mr scott prepare for departure mr scott how soon can we get underway well saavik i guess this is goodbye you will be in good hands here dont concern yourself saavik your leave has been granted for good and proper cause how are you feeling thank you lt saavikexcelsior why in gods name would you want that bucket of bolts admiral youll be trapped its under water theres no way to reach it no power to the bay doors you better get up there sir were having some power falloff the beasties seem happy to see you doctor i hope you like our little aquarium full power sir stand by sir miracle worker at work ill have to reenergize admiral there be whales here 10 seconds admiral 5 4 3 2 1 stay with me sir i need more power curve aye but ive never beamed up 400 tons before im ready spock lets go find george and gracie ill try sir scott out well now hes got himself in a bit of a snit dont he its going slow sir itll be well into tomorrow sorry admiral we just thought youll like to know were beaming them now sorry sir we cant even do that in the 23rd century oh twentyfour hours give or take staying cloaked after that admiral well be visible and dead in the water in any case we wont have enough to break out of the earths gravity to say nothing of getting back home theyre giving out decrystallizing two admiral how am i going to handle all that weight humpbacked people i suppose i can sir are you planning to take a swim about 60 feet admiral were ready sir ive converted the dilithium sequencer to something less primitive and admiral ive replaced the klingon food packs they was givin me sour stomach give me one more day sir the damage control is easy reading klingon is hard thats the ticket laddie the keyboard how quaint hello computer yes i noticed now suppose just suppose i could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick would that be worth something to you eh ah what else indeed let me put it another way how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18000 cubic feet of water i notice youre still working with polymers doctor nichols i might have something to offer you i will can my assistant come too well thats different i demand to see the owners i demand dont know anything about it i find it difficult to believe that ive come millions of miles humans make illogical decisions i would accept that as an axiom i do this because i was there to earth to offer testimony as you wish since you deem them of value but i can not wait here to find them the question is irrelevant i do not understand the final question youre saying it is a compliment i dont think he understands guessing is not in my nature best shot acceleration is no longer a constant your perception is correct doctor in order to return us to the exact moment at which we left the 23rd century i have used our journey back through time as a referent calculating the coefficient of elapsed time in relation to the acceleration curve hamlet act i scene 4 that is what i said doctor 10 million years earlier humpbacks were heavily hunted by man they have been extinct since the 21st century it is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact specifically humpback whales there are millions of other species on earth doctor only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man most unusual an unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power i find it illogical that its intentions are hostile pardon me doctor i am hearing many calls of distress a joke is a story with a humorous climax it would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference i did not have time on vulcan to review the philosophical disciplines my shoes uhura is busy i am monitoring is there something wrong with the one i have are you sure it isnt time for a colorful metaphor i was not the hell they did they like you very much but they are not the hell your whales attempting the hell to communicate to hunt a species to extinction is not logical i will admiral no data admiral computers are nonfunctional they did admiral hardly admiral i can not even guarantee we will escape the suns gravity i will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory mr scott can not give me exact figures admiral so i will make a guess admiral you must wait one damn minute no admiral but is the human thing to do admiral may i suggest that dr mccoy is correct we must help chekov admiral full power is restored in that event the probabilities are that our mission would fail no word since beamin we can only wait for their call the tank will be finished by morning i meant how will playing cards help i believe i was successful in communicating our intentions they are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man the hell i cant exaggerate i can not tell a lie i see why not yes admiral if we were to assume these whales are ours to do with as we please we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction ah the giants for example your use of language has altered since our arrival it is currently laced with shall i say more colorful metaphors double dumb ass on you and so forth admiral may i ask you a question as you observed a primitive culture how do you know this simple logic will suffice we need a map that one should do werent those a birthday present from dr mccoy nuclear power was widely used in naval vessels we could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber causing crystalline restructure theoretically if memory serves there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors resulting in toxic side effects by the beginning of the fusion era these reactors had been replaced but at this time we should be able to find some there is a 20th century possibility admiral if i may were probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere i believe we have arrived at the late 20th century i have availability of fuel components mass of the vessel through a time continuum and the probable location of humpbacks in this case the pacific basin not with this equipment i have had to program some of the variables from memory the late 20th century ready to engage computer admiral in progress admiral there is one but i can not guarantee its success we could attempt to find some humpback whales that would be futile admiral the probe would neutralize us easily the humpback was indigenous to earth earth of the past the sounds but not the language we would be responding in gibberish as suspected the probes transmissions are the songs sung by whales to the onboard computer room to confirm my suspicion a distinct possibility admiral the president did say the transmission was directed at the earths oceans it would be improper to refer to you as jim while you are in command admiral also i must apologize for my attire i seem to have misplaced my uniform thank you admiral permission to come aboard tell her i feel fine they are my friends most kind father it is kind of you to make this effort fatherarigato sayonara thank you honorable sir sulu hikaru ah chigaau hito da hanashi kata ga okashii yes this must be true you talk funny ojichan akira ojichaan dewa naino koko de nani shiteru noim upside down i know it im gon na eject you better not

danger yes sir ahhh runs in the family sir yes sirthree guesses so have i its only been a week keep sending him up walked right into it yeah we get one of these guys every damn class maverick tell me one thing but you continued to fight the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet jester at what point did you call off the fight ill have to think about it i dont know about them i do know one thing weve got a lot invested in you wed hate to lose it even more than those other guys naval aviation needs a very few very good men i didnt say that thats up to you i think that if you do if you choose to come back youll be a better pilot a better man kid the plain fact isyou are im not gon na stand here and blow sunshine up your ass technically they absolved you you and i know what really happened you pushed it you are responsible and youll always carry that you know what ill carry it too i should have taken you out of that cockpit i guess im a hopeless romantic i always try to find something worthwhile in someones death its no tradeoff its not one for one what you learned isnt worth his death it couldnt be but maybe there is some value in it i know its the first thing ive ever seen thats really gotten to you now the question is what will you do with it if it gets you out of flight statusso you dont kill yourself or anybody elsethats good thats one good thing you were an accident waiting to happen not something they tell dependents they waved him off he thought he knew better he hit the ramp you may not think so but you are vf 51 the oriskany you remind me of him youre just like he was only betterand worse sometimes its luck but in this case he earned it i served with your old man i didnt say that thats up to you but i have responsibility for the other guys up there not just you they need to know youre all rightthat they can depend on you its no disgrace kid that spin was hell it would wreck anyones confidence you could be a good pilot again someday i didnt know either thats why i told jester to prepare your papers or you can quit we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except cnc course not completed no explanation required theoretically it doesnt hurt your career but people always wonder about things like that my wifes house no bother my first squadron in vietnam we lost eight out of eighteen planes ten guys the first one kills you but therell be othersyou can count on it goose is dead how do you feel oh you mean the thrill then why are you here talent is no holy shield von richtofen was killed by a farm boy instincts are not enough do it our way weve worked these things out the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive why do you have to do everything the hard way of course you did i said a great flyer not a smart one you fly reckless great instincts no discipline that ambush today you followed your emotions instead of your wingman of course you got killedand well deserved to it was a really stupid mistake in battle it gets people killed twenty years experience i couldnt shake you you may be a great flyer i mean that snapshotmissed him big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane the rules of engagement are not flexible they exist for your safety you will obey them is that clear why is that how you remember it a good man good flyer youre father was marvin mitchell maverick whered you get that call sign i like that in a fighter pilot its okay to be confident you have to think youre king kong to want to try to land on carriers just keep in mind the other component of successteamwork considering the company youre in thats a pretty arrogant attitudeyou just sit tight jason once the authorities from carpenter get here youll whaddya mean better get out the hefty bags looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story is that all you found better call an ambulance first im getting real tired of this maniac but thats no what worries me the mostits how far hell go to try and prove it its kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitchs mind yes megan tommy jarvis is a killer a very deranged boy who wants you to believe that and make sure my daughter stays put shes grounded rick keep and eye on our wacko kid ill be back as soon as i can we have trying to track you down the phone there is disconnected and i said shut up he is only tommy wants to prove the legend is true you stay put and im not kidding not whatwho seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned you watch that smartmouthing young lady when you stop acting like one tommy jarvis is a very sick boy and you megan take your friends back to the camp ill let you know if i hear anything about your counselors megan get away from him hes dangerous megan my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble yeahthey shouldve paid their bill if i had you where i really wanted you theyd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde with extreme car for gods sake if that kid is with her theres every good chance hell do something crazy dont concern yourself martin this boy needs treatment were taking care of it sorry for the disturbance ive seen it i was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass but i dont want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter or anyone else with your warped mind no you kids better leave this boy here is not well and i need to talk to him in private i sympathize with you kids the best i can do is call the station in carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them youre gon na be sorry if you dont shut the fuck up either you go to sleep or ill come in there and put you out they were gon na but some asshole sent a lot of money to give jason and his mother a decent burial now look you just lie down and get some rest in the morning ill call that clinic and see if they no problem rick come over and meet a former resident here tommy jarvis hes got some kinda prank going about and youve been at some psychiatric clinic ever since havent you arent you the kid whose mother and friends were hold it whoa whats your name son dont piss me off junior or i will repaint this office with your brains now you better cool out a minute boy you already almost got your head blown to piecesyes and i said hand me those padlocks whewokay hand me those padlocks i hope so crystal lakewhere the nightmare began it probably wouldnt have any effect on him the only sure way to stop jason is to return him to his original resting place where he drowned in 1957 i thank you for getting me out but i got ta finish what i started sorry megan not this time come and get it cause it stinks no so what are ya drawin its just beginning okay theres one uhyes but what i already have a very good idea what couldve happened megan jason is out there he has to be stopped im positive hes heading back to the lake area hell keep killing until yeah hi listen ive got to talk to your dad about jason ive got a plan i need to buy some things first but mainly need help to doesnt that tell you something you got me where you want me theres no reason not please dont do anything crazy jasons not in his coffin hawes is dig it up you got ta dig it up please sheriff youll see we dug it up i got ta show you

about the next family in the morning paper in my monkey ward safehouse cause i cant take my family home this ends when i make it over sidney i dont understand him we know he rearranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience to witness the act we know he thinks the act is making him into something different his becoming but i dont know what it is he thinks hes becoming the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors thats whats missing for me why the mirrors what have we missed if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor hell come for me so were going to set me up as bait to draw him out give him a clean shot thats what you were thinking isnt it hed know it from articles hes read about lecktor they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out in thirtyfive minutes he doesnt have anything to cut with the main thing is how was lecktor to reply thats it lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me read it will graham jack crawford its happening again jack theres somebody in the house jack ill cover the back how far aways the backup what this is our boy parking permits it does doesnt it have him peel the top label back what its going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds film can gateway lab st louis missouri we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in theyre in the far corner of the room under the windows dont talk to me you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way when he was watching from the woods why didnt he use it to go through the basement door thats why the boltcutter you wan na watch this or what its not over yet something lecktor said hes a very shy boy there has to be hes very careful very designed when he chooses if we find out how he finds them then well find him how do i know its a word killing them his delusion is if he sees himself accepted enough times he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time and he would record it somehow so he can see himself received over and over again he changes them into beings that accept him and he needs to see the acceptance in the mirrors i didnt understand the mirrors before its very important when im done thats narrow whats it narrow down to i arranged for him to have a phone i have to call him in a few minutes no i wont be here get me a plane get me a plane tell me now whatd it say who is it we will feel sick for a very long time run it and if we pull it we lose a week we only have two to the next full moon can we still get lecktors message out of the paper twentyfive minutes we wont make it in time personal ads we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler the stuff about me and lector i dont know any other paper that carried it after weve worked the note we want to replace it in lecktors cell i dont want him to know we found it wheres lector now what is it who did he ask for did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds the mark yes to recover the mind set im going to see lecktor because he has a genuine taste for it jack you think im gon na spot him across a crowded room thats ezio pinza youre thinking about the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky he wont stop he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time we find an event that connects both families same vacation hotel same hospital different times then we check employees and come up with a male nurse hairdresser whatever if we find out how he found them then well find him dont expect too much from me jack all right well get him one way or the other i dont know jack hes got no face for me atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders five will get you ten they dont come up with an identification jimmie may in the finder program if hes ever been printed and in his index snuck in the hospital while i was sedated flipped back the sheets and shot pictures the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls why dont you get birmingham pd a methane probe out of dc and have them cover the backyard maybe the cats dead and the kids buried it mrs leeds fingernails and toenails i think he took off his gloves jack and dust all the corneas of all their eyes he is good bur not as good as price get him to atlanta jack this is graham is price still in latent prints lets talk after dinner stay and eat as long
