procedure the fifty kilos matthew i have to find it i cant let it get out on the street stay out of this matthew tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall where is the drug where have they taken it if the drug is here we must destroy it they had months in quarantine to develop the plan porter with his chemistry background must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug hubley manufactured it at the refinery strader through the nightclub established a distribution network and harcourt i must trust you matthew i can not stop this without you your people dont know about this part of out past and they cant know it would threaten our entire existence here no i am sure not that is why i am so concerned someone must now be producing it here but none of my people know how to make it the process was carefully guarded we all did like your cocaine i suppose the high lasts several hours we would receive small amounts of it as a reward for our labor it is called ssjabroka to us it is a potent narcotic no i can not involve you this is not your concern you must leave me alone on this warren hubley was in middle management at a refinery joshua strader operated a successful bar and nightclub what was that about thank you stop the car please i must get out here stop the car to the to the beach shes very progressive im certain shes considering it shes going to divorce me a man a human was wiring it to your car i didnt get a good look at him i must call my wife im going home i hope you can understand how special your world is how unique a people you humans are so it us all the more painful and confusing to us that so few of you seem capable of living up the the ideals you set for yourselves you humans are very curious to us you invite us to live among you in an atmosphere of equality weve never known before you lay before us a beautiful green world full of freedoms and opportunities you give us ownership of our lives for the first time and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves to live by the rules rules that arent made to keep one people subordinate to another but rules that exist to preserve equality you aspire to very high ideals here there is so much our two peoples dont understand about each other ta sstrakyona in the other mans rectum human children can be very beautiful getting married congratulations you will be taking sunday off then your home is quite disordered i thought perhaps you had been burglarized when i walked in we mate for life divorce is a strange concept to us you are married my wife she worries about me i believe he is probably lying when will strader return todd watson the assistant manager sstrokya sslato na ssloka it means literally small but intelligent creature it loses much in the translation our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked this is mole its good three months we learn quickly we adapt it is our strength what we were bred for to adapt to hostile environments if i may make a suggestion we have different weak spots than you do next time a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm here will produce the effect i think you were looking for in the camps we were lodged four to a room the selection process was entirely random we did not get to stay with our friends or families from quarantine when my people first arrived here he and i were housed together matthew you dont have to your mother mates out of season screw you but i uh matthew at the end of the bar agree to work with me you dont like me you dont like any of us you have nothing but contempt for us and yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner why did you do it wed like to ask you about a business associate of your warren hubley he has not been home since that day but she told me where to find him she didnt know him but she said her son might a week ago two men came to see her husband after they left he was very frightened she identified one of the men from a photo i showed her it was hubley mrs porter is not taking her husbands death well i believe i should interview the widow alone a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us my spouses brother is one newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks and still it fits and that fits what is this shouldnt we examine their personal effects nothing yes no it is not unreasonable although i well yes quite possibly what is wrong yes the murder at the minimart is not our case the captain said there was no wallet but he was still wearing a watch and two rings through the chest rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts his body was

some small ray of light on the other does that sound unreasonable to you nothings wrong i just want to get something straight you agree that theres a good chance these two shootings are somehow related right well theres a thing about partners about being somebodys partner you do for each other and other peoples rules dont mean shit its the rules set up between the two of you thats all that

it like you loved that projection booth of the paradiso when you were little no toto nobody said it i say it lifes not like you saw it in the movies lifeis harder get out go back to rome you re young the world is yours and im oldi dont want to hear you talk any more i want to hear talk about you do like the soldier toto go away this land is cursed when youre here every day you feel like youre at the center of the universe it seems like nothing ever changes then you go away one year twoand when you come back everythings different the thread has broken you dont find those you were looking for your things no longer exist isnt that the caseyouve got to go away a long time for many many years before coming back and finding your people again the land where you were bornbut not now its impossible now youre blinder than i am it was probably meant to be like this each of us has a star to follow so now what are you thinking of doing did you ever see her again toto sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing so its better to shut up its hot in here toto take me to the beach you re thinneryou can tell youve not been treated well no nobody came but whered you go toto you were expecting her huh its a nasty business waiting by yourself in company its better nothen ill leave you werent expecting me could bebut i dont like this business it smells fishy to me toto are you pulling my leg or something how is it possible to see this television without film i want to make you happy toto im going to tell you a story once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm basta one of the guards saw the kings daughter she was the loveliest of all and he immediately fell in love with her but what could a poor soldier do compared with a kings daughterone day he managed to meet her and told her he couldnt live without her the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony then in the end ill be yours christ the soldier ran off there and waited one day two days ten twentyevery night she looked out of her window but he never budged come rain wind snow never budged the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldnt hold them back he didnt even have the strength to sleep any more the princess kept watchand on the ninetyninth night the soldier got up picked up his chair and left heeey totooooo dont get pissed off with me now come here i dont know where the fuck i have to go and the next time be careful how you talk not to take credit away from the lord but if i had created the world in all modesty certain things would have come out better but unfortunately such was not the case dont think about it toto dont even try with feelings theres nothing to understand i told you the blueeyed ones are the most difficult theyre not my words john wayne said it in shepherd of the hills eh lovewhat a mystery i understand you totothe ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful whatever you do you cant make friends with them eh theres nothing to be done about it the heavier a man is the deeper his footprints and if hes in love he suffers because he knows hes up a oneway street because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants whats she like whats she like is there a womantell me the truth there is a woman now what can you see what is it what is it whats the picture ive shown it so many times i know it by heart the first time i showed it in 1940 was the sunday my first wife died they kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldnt have to close down the movie house i only found out that night after the last show those are things you never forget so toto how are these home movies going chaplins modern times right toto progress it always arrives too late for example at this moment the films out of focus go see toto this isnt for you for the moment the cinema paradiso needs you and you need the cinema paradiso but it wont lastsome day youll have other things to do more important things thats right more important i know it now that ive lost my sight i see more i see everything i didnt see before and its all thanks to you who saved my life and ill never forget it and dont put on that look i havent gone off my head yet you want proof dont do thatsooner or later youll be left emptyhanded hows school any room for me in this cinema paradiso its got to be sent to another town and if we dont the owner of that movie house gets pissed off who knowsits like an adventure hope springs eternal you understand which side the gelatins on with timeyou get used to it besides when you hear from up here that theres a full house and that people are laughing having fun then youre happy too so ive been wasting my breath you pretend to agree with me but as soon as my back is turned you do what you want get out of here i dont want to lay eyes on you again this is the last straw your mothers right youre crazy but howd he do it the little bastard by watching hes learned its incredible im letting the box office know youre not to set foot even into the theatre there are no more tickets for you and im also talking to father adelfio you wont be an altar boy any more either you little runt good for you toto good for you im only saying this for your own good cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter you breathe in smoke gas fumes and earn practically nothing because im an idiot how many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist none only a jerk like me could do it besides i wasnt lucky when i was a kid there was the war when i grew up another war now its all different times have changed and you want to be a dope like me huh answer me because i dont want to toto this is not a job for you its like being a slave youre always alone you see the same film over and over again because you have nothing else to do and you start talking to greta garbo and tyrone power like a nut you work on holidays on christmas on easter only on good friday are you free but if they hadnt put jesus christ on a crossyoud work good fridays too now listen to what ive got to say i took up this profession when i was ten years old in those days there werent these modern machines the films were silent the projectors were run by hand like this with a crank and you wound the crank all day long it was really rough going if you got tired and slowed down boom everything would go up in flames toto come here all right all right when ive got kids thats what im telling them i choose my friends for their looks and my enemies for their brains youre too smart to be my friend besides as i always tell my kids be careful to pick the right friends of course i knew your father he was tall thin pleasant and had a moustache like mine always smiling he looked like clark gable what you find tonight on the floor between the seats signora maria dont do that hes just a kid and why are you telling fibs we let him in free he must have lost the money inside the movie theatre how much did you have what are you doing here look toto before i kick your ass all the way to china and back lets make a deal these strips here are yours i give them to you however one youre not to stick your nose in here any more two ill keep them for you because you cant take them home for god forbid and save our souls if they catch fire all hell will break loose ok oh and now scram cause sometimes you cant find the right place any more and sowell actuallythey stay here besides there are more kisses than you can count you must not come here how many times do i have to tell you if the film catches fire runt that you are youd go up in a burst of flamewhoosh and turn into a piece of oh yes father now everythings clear i know but take themiracle of the loaves and fishes for example i think about it a lothow is it possible for father adelfio i have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul and youve got to help me because ive lost all peace of mind good morning father its hard on the feet huhthanks for all youve done for me who said that gary cooper james stewart henry fonda huh now i understand why the soldier went away just before the end thats right just one more night and the princess would have been his but she also could not have kept her promise andthat would have been terrible he would have died from it so instead for ninetynine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him listen to this onethe commander says to the sergeant you remember that windmill that used to be there yes sir i remember the mills gone but the winds still there you remember the story of the soldier and the princess no and nobody knows where she is they tell me you never go out never talk to anybody why im here take it easy take it easy sit down sit down did she come no alfredo i was coming to help you just so alfredo there isnt any and if you buy a television set you can watch it at home without any fuss no you mean right at the end alfredo thats right toto right at the end and dont ask me what it means if you figure it out let me know you see it s like i say you always have an answer for everything stop it ive had enough of your sermons you act as if you created the world but why there must be some way to make her understand what you say is wonderful but sad yes its a girl i saw at the station nothing theres nothing its all out of focus its people in the slaughterhouse killing a calf theres blood all over the floor like a lake and through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die yes thats right modern times whatd i tell you it doesnt catch fire yes i want proof why what do you mean ok ok but now that ive got a job i11 probably stop going come in alfredo too bad peppinoooo come back sooon good thing germanys closer than russia will they really find work in germany it tastes wonderful alfredo go fuck yourself but dont you like anything about what you do no then why dont you change jobs then why dont you want to teach it to me too now that theres no more cranking and its easier i told my mother you werent the one who gave me the films that it wasnt your fault but i thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me now that i know i wont steal any more from you thats all i wanted to say im going but you dont have any kids alfredo did you know my father fifty lire i bought a ticket ive come to see the film so i can have these and turn into a piece of charcoal ill never agree with you never elena but i never saw that note i must have covered it with my hand without realizing it thats the only explanation oh how i looked for you elena youll never know i wrote telephoned nothing nobody ever answered but i dreamt of you for years thats why i went awayand never came back here even as the years passed in all the women i met i was only looking for you i had success its true but there was always something missing id never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me a crazy lunatic alfredo damn him he cast his spell on you too but ive never forgotten you elena sure sure boccia whats he do no and im not married are you happy i saw your daughter shes beautiful who knows how many salvatores must be running after her alfredo died do you remember him youre still beautiful who

day after tomorrow morning theyre sending me to rome but theyll discharge me ten days later lets go elenabut when thats nothing to do with it its the car thats still being run in for you to fall in love with me too listen carefully every night when i get off work ill come and wait beneath your window every night when you change your mind open your window thats all ill understand i dont care ill

salvatoreand yours you never used to do that noits nothing to do with you its just that i was scared of coming back now after all these years i thought i was strong that i had forgotten lots of things

gave you an explanation no mamma it only takes an hour by air you know theyre always writing to me saying they want to come to rome daddys not coming backhes dead somebody stole it no i dont remember
