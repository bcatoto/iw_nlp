Where is Reed? No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben. Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one -- He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead -- What did he do to the uniform?! He didn't. The suit will stretch. You should try it -- We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped. I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor. We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here. Victor did. I'll schedule the launch. Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew. But Johnny... you can't fly. What are you doing -- No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out. As soon as you stop acting like one. Come on, you're smarter than this. You think those people out there care about you? You're just a fad to them. Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to -- Is that what you call it? "Real"? Johnny? Did you see Ben? You two need a time-out. You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now? I'm driving. Girl...?! That's the temperature of the sun. You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova -- Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life? I think that thing is Ben. Stop it. Johnny. Apparently I can disappear. The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to -- A gasket? Reed, we're at a party. I'm sure I can come up with something. You need a doctor. Reed, stop, you need to rest your -- That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed... I'm saying it now. When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me. I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man. I gave him twenty. Of course I was. I'd read all your papers on bioethics. Some of them two times just so I'd have something to say to you. Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous. Reed. Shh. Just be quiet. And look up. Every variable but yourself. You don't eat, sleep. You can't live in your head like -- Better than your life. Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing. We are. Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake -- Reed. How close are we to a cure? And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well. But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...? And reverse the mutations -- What are you doing? No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does. I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that? Reed. I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked. Are you kidding? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or -- I'm sure I can come up with something. Anger. Rage. Frustration. Excuse me? What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope? If it happened to him, then it could... How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us? What...? Oh. What? It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA. What? What do you mean you -- You are such a dork, Reed... You never got it and never will unless it's explained to you in quantum physics. Which was? You're happy for me and Victor. You always had a way with words. I should be getting back. Yes, thanks. Great minds think alike. Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll. You remember my brother Johnny... It's been changed. Right. That's exactly what I meant. I was talking about us. Working together. Never better. Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready. Please don't make this personal -- If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us. He's working round the clock. But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before -- Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't -- You said it was urgent. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to -- Victor, your scar -- Victor, I'm sorry I -- Victor, are you feeling alright? You can't leave them out there. What are you doing? Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think... It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much. I understand the business reasons. It's just business.What? Really? How much you got to see the show? How much you got? You wanna see, baby? Um-hmmm. Doesn't your foot hurt? Okay then. But -- Why not then? Will I go crazy or something? Really? Oh, no. What is this? Oh. How are you holding up?Where is everyone? We're going to get my little girl. We'll meet in three hours? You know where it is? They'll be back. He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons. Don't be stupid, drop the gun! Careful. We can't risk letting them in. Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me... ...this is just another Tuesday. Just move! We just smeared a skunk. Where's the tunnel? Follow me. This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it. Now, who else is in? Seven can go. HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him. What's it for? What tunnel? Where? Don't bullshit me! If you know a way out of this place and you're holding out -- Easy. Hey! No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran. He just ran. And that's how I ended up here. Unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside. That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed. It's imperative that you get that truck moving. But not flush against the tunnel? What's in the back? All right! Tell us about the truck! What? Anybody else? We're going to get help. Anyone else? Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die! Keys. Nine? Max? How many? Open? Four door? Is it gassed up? What's it for!? What's going on between you two? What do you mean what? What? You're wasting your time, there's no one out there. No one goes anywhere alone. Least of all, unarmed. Good. Will these boards hold? He shot you the other time. He only shot you once. Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex. He's dead. My husband... There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is? Get something on that. COME ON! MOVE YOUR ASS! Hurry! If he doesn't shut up... Shit! Move it! Move slow and move quiet. Done. But you're locked in. Will you hold the keys? You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk. We'll be on the other side waiting for you. If you become food I don't want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. It's your funeral. NO, but I will lock you in. Fine, Chief. 'Eh, Chief? HOLD THAT TIGHT! Let's move. Ok. Let's see what happens. Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE? Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here. So, who's going into the basement with me? As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack. They'll tear this place down within the hour. YOU'LL HIT US! Let's go. Nothing, just lookin'. Right. Were going to need some fire power. Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all? Get to your cars! Go!!! Go! Go! Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right? Wait God-dammit! Hold it! That's fine. Okay, well that's something. Father. The biggest, the strongest... If you are face to face with her, dive left. I think -- We should stick together out there. I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side. She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her. Her name is Charlie. Right. I admire your strength. You know you don't have to do this. All right. Let's lock off this room. Stop her! That's one piece of four problems.Why? Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason... Mom, he just fixed our car. How you doin'? It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that? You're bleeding pretty bad there. Ok. Ok, I guess. I've been ok. Then, where are you going? 112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you? What? Ok. Ssh. Rest. Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through. To the hospital. Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we? What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you. That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you. William, you're not making sense. It's Sunday. [Beat] I don't know. I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are. What? What are you thinking? [Beat, lost] No. They're not here. Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D. Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going. It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it... You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't. What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy. They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed. How long do we have? Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled. Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with. You think Lorenson kills you? Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene? No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them. I know. Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you. Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do. [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you? I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was... I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it. [Beat] You bled to death. But no one knew until after... It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients... The Jacket. That's what they call it, right? Please... I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave. No, it's not. [Beat] It's December 25th, 2004. I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now. I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up. No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow. I looked it up. His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine... William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave. You can't be William Starks. He's dead. Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back. Well, you belong in one. What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license? If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police. What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything. William Starks. [Beat] Thanks. What for? What're those? You're just gonna walk? Yeah. But I like it I guess. Jackie. Yeah, but I don't know what. Our car won't start. Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep... Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups. I don't understand. How? Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he? What should they be looking for? It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about. I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have. I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different. I still don't either, even after all these years. He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him. It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him. Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough. What are you talking about? Who told you this? William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state. I do believe you... I'm not gonna let that happen. What for? You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you. You have nothing to fear, William. Yeah. You told me this was how it happened. I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you? I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions. How do you know about Eugene? William, that is just another facet of my delusions. And how do you know that? Why not? Why don't you help me? [Beat] Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe? What about the world? The future doesn't look different? Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like? Well, what time is it? Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously. No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you. What do you mean? You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition. Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out. It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it? So maybe Dr. Becker would know. [Beat] But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities. How do you know about Dr. Becker? I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here. I was working with a boy named Eugene. At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things. Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient. My God you look exactly like him. You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here. So it's helping? You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged. You were convicted of the crime. You're not crazy. I guess I'd ask you why.Yeah, me too. [Softly] Every day for the last ten years. She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. [Beat] I came home from work and she was gone. Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young. I'm sorry. So you never knew your mother? May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple. You remember it? Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not. [Beat] Real is overrated. Well, good for you. Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from? [Beat] I do it. Yup. That's me. This is pretty good. Considering... You want a drink? No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks. What's this? You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch. No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink? Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat. Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you? Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings? Do you have a motel or something? Money? Well, how'd you get here? Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that. Of course you don't know. Well, where are you from? You don't have anywhere to stay? Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options. All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister? In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here. Good. If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.<i>I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.</i> What is it, Choco?

It's your best play, Nicky. It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel. I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight? Because we're completely mismatched. We're able to surprise each other. I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done. It can't be all that personal. You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning. What? Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else. Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan. That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed. They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all. Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie. Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course. She died. What about her? Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution. Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.Daddy, wait. Will I believe you when you tell me something? What will we talk about? Except I won't have a father anymore. I'm not sure. I have a class. I'm late. I don't have a date. I don't want a date. Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it. I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition? Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going. I didn't turn her into Mother. You did. Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me? She is kicking you out. Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years. Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused. Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back. She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee' Is it? So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer? I'm seeing your play tonight, remember? I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about. I go to college. I thought you knew. See, Daddy. What else? See, Daddy. Yes. And no more evasive tactics. Yes. You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name? Knowing who a person is. Down deep. Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy. What do we want? I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself. Yes. A flat-out hit. Packs an emotional wallop. Brilliantly moving. You have to tell me what you thought of the play. I'm willing to tell you my name. Why won't you tell me your name?I'm glad we're having this talk. I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office. It violates so many trusts. She's my gynecologist. Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you? Joanne Bourne. I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years. Be open with me. I'd like that. That's very lovely actually. I'd forgotten that. You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian. That's always been my problem. Who the hell cares? I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier. He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut. I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer. I want to be fair-minded, Nicky. I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column. Your father said you might be here.Alla puttanesca. Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice. Elliot? Guys ready to order? He feels he has to defend himself if necessary. He goes to the theater armed. Our Steven not only disguises himself. Never mind. Do you want to talk about doing crazy things. But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom? If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what? No one's waiting. Home. He's a very sweet man. Do you think he can do it? Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play. Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone. Is what true? The fact is, I have to get going. He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue. Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously. I hear good things about the new play. I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows. Alla puttanesca. What? A little drastic maybe? Engaging. He has -- something. A funny little quality I find -- A little. Not one of Steven's finer moments. I think I remember. I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him? We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca. I'm going home to my machine. I don't want you, Steven. Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider. Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently. In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair. I haven't come to you.This could be it! Don't worry. It's a test. Because faith is rewarded. Washed away. Because God loves a winner. Matthew. Speak it like it's real. Matthew. Then say it. Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it. If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down. You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person. You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody. It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work. Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy. It's a simple subject. And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it. An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do? You're a family man, Frankie? Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once. Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury. You're charming the boy. You see what you're doing, don't you? That's a simple subject. This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming. He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before. Matthew's my grandson. Might be an accident on the West Side Highway. The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro? Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. Where's your white Lincoln limo? You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island. I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.Get the hell out of here.''! Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig! To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible. It's ... lovely. Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ... There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you! I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder! Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go. Oh God, it's that bloody yank! Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... � organize an expedition - Father ... Father! Father! I photographed it extensively, father. A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think? It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright. You're the animals - all of you! He's gonna die! They'll kill him! Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this? Jack!... Jack! No! Don't! Give it back! Jack! This is the archeological find of the century! But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information. Jack! It's the same image - Kong! There's a light up ahead. I can't imagine you crying. I want to thank you. I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard. Can you fly? I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me! Where do I charter a boat? No! God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value! How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist! Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down? No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make! He's grubbing for money, father.Wow. You look beautiful. Sure, disappear. We�ve been walking away our whole lives. Hey. You practically bribed him with your erector set. We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend. I was fourteen. Are you sure you�re okay? What? Why? What do you mean? But I do. I will. You�re my sister. Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about-- Pub Golf? Why don�t you get my half sister her seventh hole? Drunk isn�t the same thing as happy, Amy. Christ, Amy. Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed? Except it�s Scotch. There�s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you? She did? Mom, please. Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants. I was pretty hard on her last night. And now she�s getting married. So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches. She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet. Oh, no. She tells this story at every major holiday. I�d be happy to. You�re welcome. Sir, yes, sir! Mom�s refining her strategy for DDay. Huh? My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it�s-- Where�s Nick sleeping? I�m sorry? It�s the past. It�s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let�s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu. Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning. But not anymore. Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It�s no big deal. I promise. When we were together I was �too here,� now I�m not here enough. Is this supposed to be an apology? Not for a dog. Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do. So, what�s your point? That was a long time ago. Um, news flash: I don�t give a shit. It�s called character. God, you�re predictable. Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we�re the past. I�m not sure if you noticed, but I�m here with someone else. So, tell me, how�s unmarried life? Maybe not her least... There�s always-- Hey, you! Hey, yourself. I see you�ve met my ex. Yeah? Why, Jeffrey. Hello. Thank you. What?! No, no. You can�t-- Hi. You�re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me. You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don�t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It�s your job. It�s who you are. How would you even know if something were real? You�ve always got that to hide behind, don�t you? It�s just business! He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing. I didn�t say he was worth it. Yeah. Spontaneously combust? What would you do if you weren't an escort? Desperation? So, why�d you say yes to me? You have had girlfriends? I�m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this. He was about to un-stick me! I paid you to help me get closure. Oh, cut the crap! But nothing did. What? And what if I didn�t want you to...to do that to me? So you�re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That�s a down payment on a Ford Focus! Not if you take an advance on your credit card. Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened. Are you sure? Come on. Show me. Subtle? Oh, come on. You�re like the Yoda of escorts. Okay. This is awkward for me. Talking about it makes me feel better. My sixth-grade science project was entitled, �Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.� Trust me, I�m careful. I guess so. What?! So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart. And you thought I�d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries? You shit! Oh, no. Shampoo, got it! If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys. I have a friend at the magazine. Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K. Sorry. I�m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me. Not you. You�re not disgusting. You�re lovely. Just the idea that they�d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn�t...who never.... I mean, someone�s dead. I think that�s disgusting. A wedding. Have you ever done anything like this before? I do? What is? What? Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock. I�m desperate to start but I don�t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can�t get enough of. That won�t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant. No offense. How does it feel to get that much money just for being you? Six thousand, right? I�m compulsive and weird? No, count it, anyway. What does your gut say? What did he say exactly? I mean, you don�t think he wants me back? Of course he is. I�m here with my new man. I love it! Your magic�s already working. Let the suffering begin. Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram�. Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about? Oh, yeah. So we split it. You know, as in �share.� People do that. I don�t do naked. My sister? She does naked. Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm-- Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go! Really? Don�t get too attached. Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it�s way better to look hot while you�re doing it. Don�t patronize me. They�ve clearly been at this a while. You have feet? Exactly. I want us to look like we fit, but not like we�re trying too hard to look like we fit. It�s welcome cocktails, not prom. With this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere. Hi. Hey. You knew? Dad made me go over and apologize the next day. Therapist. You didn�t have to do that. You have more than one gynecologist? Of course, don�t be silly. Yes? No. What? Save the patter for the tourists. Not exactly. I wear it. On my right hand. And only rarely. Give it back? Are you nuts? I get all the glamour jobs. Hey, Sal. Yeah. It�s complicated, Dad. That�s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back. Good morning. Meet Nick. Dad! She�s drunk. -er than me. But I didn�t really dump you, did I? I haven�t thought about that in years. I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal? �...but it�s getting there. � I�m worried. Amy�s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker? Is it �drunker� or �drunker-er�?
