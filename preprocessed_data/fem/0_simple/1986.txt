Can we dream? Are we going to sleep now? Mommy...Mommy? I knew you'd come. This way. Come on, we're almost there! Sure. Go left. Come on. Crawl faster. Look! Mommy...I mean, Ripley...I'm scared. Wah...? Where are...? Don't go! Please. You mean dead. Where is she? Did you ever have a baby? Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you? Did one of those things grow inside her? Why do they tell little kids that? My mommy always said there were no monsters. No real ones. But there are. Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic. I don't want to...I have scary dreams. You don't have to be sorry. It wasn't your fault. I guess we're not leaving, right? Yeah, you know. In the walls, under the floor. I was the ace. I could hide better than anybody. I was the best at the game. I knew the whole maze. And hope to die? You promise? They're dead. Because you'll be gone soon, like the others. Like everybody. You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone. I don't want you for a friend. Casey. She's my only friend. Newt. My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.You did okay, Bishop. She's alive. They brought her here and you know it. WE'RE NOT LEAVING! HOW MUCH TIME? It's going to be closer. You better get going. All right. Let's get on it. What'll you need? What? And it's too late to shut it down? How long until it blows? Could it be intelligent? You're saying one of those things lays all the eggs? But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from. Which would mean lots of those parasites, right? One for each person...over a hundred at least. Now let me get this straight. The aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those... Sorry to disappoint you. You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them? You sent them to that ship. I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J. But they will know about it, Burke. From me. Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here -- You just try getting a dangerous organism past ICC quarantine. Section 22350 of the Commerce Code. This operation is under military jurisdiction and Hicks is next in chain of command. Right? What rank? I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here. You son of a bitch. Bullshit! They can bill me. I got a tab running. What's second? Why not? No good. How do we know it'll effect their biochemistry? I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure. That's not what I mean. Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system. They're right under the primary heat exchangers. That the atmosphere processor? I hope you're right. I really do. You never said anything about an android being here! Why not? Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them. Not study. Not bring back. Just burn them out...clean ...forever. No! The answer is no. Now please go. I'm sorry. Just go, would you. Spare me, Burke. I've had my psych evaluation this month. If I go. It's all I could get. Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything. Days off are worse. That's right. Yeah, yeah. I saw the commercial. What about you? What's your interest in this? I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there? Forget it. No. There's no way! They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case. I get the picture. You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate. Amy. Is she...? Have they located my daughter yet? Fifty-seven...oh, Christ... Forget it. How do you feel? They're but off! Do something! GET THEM OUT OF THERE! DO IT NOW! So...then the fusion containment shuts down. I don't know. Gorman! Give it a rest would you. One of us? The structure seems intact. They have power. How may drops is this for you, Lieutenant? Ellen. Hicks, don't let him leave. No! No! She's alive! We have to -- Locked. They learned. They cut the power and avoided the guns. They must have found another way in, something we missed. Get back here, both of you. Fall back to Operations. You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse. You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage. The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back. Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked. Look, you started this. Now show me everything. I can handle myself. What's this? Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others. You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that? They'll get us. But they don't know that. They're probably looking for other ways to get in. That'll take them awhile. Now many? On my way. That's right. So we put up welded barricades at these intersections... ...and seal these ducts here and here. Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here. All right. There's a fire door at this end. The first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door. How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? Removed surgically before embryo implantation. Subject: Marachuk, John L. Died during procedure. They killed him getting it off. Can't be. That's inside the room! They're right on us. Vasquez, how you doing? I don't know, an acid hole in a duct. Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know! Seal the door. Just get back here! They cut the power. Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there. Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually. What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end. Why can't we use that? I don't care how! Think of a way. Think of something. We need the other drop-ship. The on one the Sulaco. We have to bring it down on remote, somehow. Thanks. This service tunnel is how they're moving back and forth. She survived longer than that with no weapons and no training. You can't help them. Right now they're being cocooned just like the others. Looks like it stung him. The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours. Gestating. Then it... ...then it...emerges. Moults. Grows rapidly -- No.. I've slept enough. How long have I been on Gateway station? Terrible. Yes, honey. I think we both can. That's right. Right here, baby. Right here. Newt, I want you to hang on, now. Hang on tight. Newt, wait! DO you know how to get to the landing field from here? Burke! Open the door! I know, honey. Me too. Sssh. Don't move. We're in trouble. Newt. Newt, wake up. I'll be right in the other room, Newt. And look...I can see you on that camera right up there. Gone. Yes. A little girl. No, it's different, honey. I don't know, Newt. That's the truth. Well, some kids can't handle it like you can. Yes, there are, aren't there. Oh. Sorry, Newt. Now you just lie here and have a nap. You're exhausted. I'm sorry, Newt. You're really something, ace. The 'maze'? You mean the air ducts? Cross my heart. Newt. Look at me...Newt. I won't leave you. I promise. They'd be here if they could, honey. I know they would. Why not? What about me? What did you say? Sweet Jesus. How many colonists? What are you talking about. What people? Why won't you check out LV-426? ...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching... Look, I can see where this is going. But I'm telling you those things exist. Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs. Thousands. Do you understand? I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data. Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise... That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock! Like I said. Look, I told you...Hold me. I'M FALLING! HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him! Hold me, Don. Don. Help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!! They hurt his head. My secret lover. Where have you been? Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God. Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God. No. Hi baby. I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that. Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat? I want you to stay with me. Why are you here? HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK. I did. Are you? If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death. Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again. It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. I love you Don with all my heart. Just get outta my bed. And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! I asked first. Do you love me? Kiss me. What if Frank came over here and found us? Beeeee careful. Does that scare you? Frank would open you. What if I told Frank that you opened me? You like to open me, don't you? No police!!! No police!! I want you to hurt me. Do you want to do bad things? Anything, anything. Are you a bad boy? What do you want to do? Do you like my body? I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong. No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. Don't hate me. Yes. Frank-- It used to make me laugh, but. Come in. Please, please stay. Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. You like me, huh? Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? Don? Are you in with them? Falling. Look. I can't. I can't. You think you know so much. Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die. Who's it, you mean. I'm alright. Go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet. Oh shit. I liked being with you last night. I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you. Why are you here. Whatiya want? Yeah, hurry up though. It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die. Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. You don't? Do you know? I made it go down the toilet. You can be my special friend and come and put that in me. Do you like me? You can hit me, if you want to. You can kiss them if you want. Feel them. They're getting hard. See my nipples? See my breasts? See? Do you like the way I feel? Thank you. honey. Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please. Don? Sure I'm alright. Don't. I don't like that. What do you want? Lie down on the bed. Do you like talk like that? Do you like that? What do you want? What do you want from me? No way. NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. Get undressed. I want to see you. How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? THEN WHAT? That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word. Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. Shit. You better tell me something. What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Yeah. Oh yeah, that's good. Oh God, that stuff stinks. Yes? What is it? No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said. Oh he forced you, huh? 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight. Alright, suit yourself. Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back. Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it. If you want to. Those are my breasts. Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please. Yes, but. Frank? Where are we going, Frank? He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking. Mommy's here. Hello, daddy. Hello, baby.You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late. Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? Of course, Jeffrey. Alright. Do you want the car? Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. Jeffrey, when you see your father. I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. Where's all your things, Jeffrey? Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. I mean, for good, Jeffrey.I'll get a coat for her. Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon. Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute. Here you are. Would anyone like coffee? Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey. He comes over to study. It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good. Would you like a piece of cake? I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame. Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?Look Jeffrey. No Jeffrey!! Go ahead! Go ahead. Jeffrey? What's going on? Right. Watch out for Mike, there. Probably not. No. Why? Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her? Dorothy Vallens? No. Oh my God. What's wrong? Okay. Just a minute. NO. Really? You want to dance? Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening? It's okay. Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned? It's good to see you. What was that all about? What is it? I should never had gotten you going on this. Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on! You didn't tell him about me? Everything okay? Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it. Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this. You like mysteries that much? Jeffrey? Why? I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment? Jeffrey!! Oh yeah? Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other. Shoot. You know, that cheese is practically all chemicals. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later. What am I going to do? You were late. Goodnight. You better not, Jeffrey. Okay, be careful. No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey. So are you. I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back. I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you. In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble. You're sure right. It is a strange world. Who, me? Why should it? Yeah? Did you see her undressed? Twice. Without her sensing anything? You saw a lot in one night. Wow. Should you tell my father? You want to tell me about it? You want a Dairy Queen? It's okay. Don't worry about it. He got a little jealous. What did you see? Well, how did it go? What happened? Okay, okay. Bye. I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert. I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay? I'm going to wait here until she comes. Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep? Okay, yeah, call. I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over. I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee. OK. Yeah, but. It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you. Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it. I'll drink to that. That sounds good. This is not my usual Friday night! Brilliant. What's the plan. Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock. I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7. I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do? You really want to do this, don't you? Yes. I do. I owe you, since I goofed up this one. So, what's next? Yeah, if it opens the door. No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall. I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright? Are you alright? Alright. Good luck, yourself. Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy. Alright. You've got a point there. I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous. What will I say when she comes to the door? Now, how are you going to do that? It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess. You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps. Alright, now tell me. What is it? Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart. I'm here, aren't I? Just a minute, pull over and wait a minute. I don't know. I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world. I've gotta go in. What happened to him? Still, it must be kinda rough. Yeah, I guess so. What are you going to do now that you're home? My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered. I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case. I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you. That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching. Not really, why? You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you. Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her. Maybe so. No, this has been going on for some time. Several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body, only parts. There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others. I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names. Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? That's too bad. Yeah. What are you doing now? Terrible boring. Yes. Am I bothering you? You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office? I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central. Stop it Mike. Okay. Sure, just a sec. Excuse me. Mike. We don't have to watch it. Come on. You can change it if you want to. Mike's gotta go. Nice to meet you.All right, what happened to me? Oh, sure. I'm getting used to this. I am Zuul. Fine, Louis. We'll stop in for a drink. Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by. Hi, Louis. I thought I turned it off. I guess I forgot. Oh, that's nice, Louis. I'll stop by if I'm around. No thanks, Louis. I'm really tired. I've been rehearsing all morning. Are you sick, Louis? Hi, Louis. Talk to my accountant. Thank you. Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call. Really! Is it gone? There is no Dana. I am Zuul. I am Zuul. I am ... I want you inside me. Take me now. Do you want this body? He is the Destructor. We must prepare for the coming of Gozer. I am Zuul. I am the Gatekeeper. I've got to go now. All right. Since you put it that way. I don't think so. I'm busy Thursday night. What's he doing in my refrigerator. Hittites, the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer." You must have gotten the last copy. Can't you tell me now? He is a very close friend. Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment? The "stiff?" He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man. I know. You're quite a celebrity these days. Are you here because you have info ... about my case? Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing. You're good. You heard it? Goodbye. All right. Then leave. I'll scream. Out! That's it. Get out. All right. What do you want to do? Thanks. Coming from you that really means a lot to me. This is terrible. Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy. Are you all right? I told you, I ... I'll wait here if you don't mind. Uh-huh. What? Like a used car salesman. You really don't act like a scientist. That's a violin concerto. Really? Do you have a favorite piece? No. If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real. I'm not ready to do that. No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means. Is that your professional opinion? Why would anyone make up a thing like that? ... and then I opened the door again but it was gone. There was nothing there. Barrett. Dana Barrett. Yes ... well ... I'm not sure. What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.You're a regular Sherlock Holmes. Now what do you want? What on earth gave you that idea? Yes?Go to hell. Sure. Mr. Congeniality? Let him find his own clues. There's a journal article in this somewhere. Yeah. P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30. Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his cheek. Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill. I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank. So he isn't a cop. District anyway. I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967. And the guys rich. You should see the stuff he has in that shop. It's in good condition. Scottish claymore. Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore. Claymore. Didn't think it was my buddy over there. Fine. Doesn't have a head, does he? Thanks. It's my birthday. There was a Count. Count Dusan. He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it. The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me. Would you remember his name? Have you spoken to anyone else about this? The boy _died_? I don't follow you. I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies. Then you didn't know Richard later on. Why? No thank you, I'm fine. Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it? You owe me. Besides, I'm cute. So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of- Yes. You have lived forever. The inheritance. No! What is it? What's wrong? Will I see you again? What is it you want? But you're known so much. History I'll only read about. What is it like? Being you? Damn you. Don't. Is that a threat? You kill with your left hand? You and your buddy make a real team, don't you? Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between. What about that family in '31? You killed those other two. Of bodies. That's insane. What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction. He knows about you. That's why Smith called you MacLeod. I'd like you to try. Who are you? Just a little crazy. My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses. I can't stand it. But you're different. It's in your hands. A clarity. I'm not even sure why. I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write. But it's not. It's you. I must be insane. Leaving work, ditching cops. All to follow a murderer. A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same. I hope I never get that old. It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives. That's impossible. Then you must be at least 70 years old. You're using your son's name. And you are William Taupin, aren't you? William Taupin seems to have left his mark. I don't know any of these. I'll make a fool of myself. It's beautiful. There's a catch. You're supposed to wear 19th century clothing. I thought it might be a nice break from all of this. It's some sort of party the town is throwing. Well, as long as we're stuck here. No. So what now? We just wait? The estate stuff is pretty straight forward. Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat. Yes. You want me to front for you. You make it all sound so simple. When you finish, what then? You did kill those men. What's all that? Our cars were seen together in Felton. They're calling me an accessory to murder. Is this what you killed them with? Maybe. You're wrong. No. I had to talk to you. No. Are you? I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face. I'd rather hear yours. No. I'm a witness to a murder. That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list. What about me? He was innocent. I left a man dead in Felton. But you don't really care, do you? He called you "MacLeod". What will you do now? And you? Who is he? Dupont Circle. He tried to kill me last night. What the hell is going on? Why not? Jesus Christ. I have friends. I've been to Church Hill. I think you do. Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that. Does Carl Smith? Who? Grave robbers? Someone beat you. Good reflexes. Charming guy, Basil. Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but- Byzantine? It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years. I'd like to ask you about the claymore. Very traditional. Do you play? Thanks. Now there's a new topic. I'm just curious. Never take up poker, Detective. Research. If your pal was there I never saw him. What's all of this got to do with me? What makes you so sure he's the one? You're an asshole, Moran. It'll never stick. What are you getting at, Moran? Spare me the details. Four? We've got nothing to say. I'm calling an attorney. What do you want from me? You better have a warrant. That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it. Who is it? It's bullshit. Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it. Some job. Card filing and cabinet dusting. Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do. Yeah. Corey, you _owe_ me. I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now. All I need is for you to check the name. Give it a rest Ned, huh? Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over. He has one, he might have two. I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved. It's just a hunk of peasant iron. Why would he be carrying it around in an alley? He's too cool. Too sharp. I think he's got something to do with it. I don't believe him.But Ian, he's still but a boy. Must he go? Have you time for some- thing to eat? They were Steven, they were. It's been a miracle it has. He lasted right through and healed. No one in the village has ever seen anything like it. Ever. Steven, Conor didn't die. You're a kind man to be sure. Ah Steven, it is good to see you.You -- sent them away. Without even letting me say goodbye? Why don't I? Sorry if I spoke out of turn. I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence. I mean whales may not have painted the Mona Lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didn't ravish the land either. Yeah. Bob... it's tearing me apart. Fine. Just fine. Just a couple of kooks... You sure you won't change your mind? You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that? So you were at Berkeley. I suppose they told you that...? Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here! Whoever said the human race was logical? Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy. Don't worry. I'll find you . See you around the galaxy... Why does it have to be goodbye? You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do. I belong here. Suppose by some miracle you do get them through. Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales? ... What does that mean? Oh my God, we're too late! You need me. All right. The frequency is 401 megahertz. What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales... What are you talking about? I'm coming with you. Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you. If we keep going up, they'll catch us! What kind of spaceship is this, anyway? They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now. Kirk. They're gone. But Kirk... Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real? It's true... what you said... Here... In the park? I bet you're a damn good poker player. So. There we are. Sorry, that's classified. I don't really have a clue who you are... You wouldn't want to show me around your space ship, would you? Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard. Jesus, you are persistent. Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out. Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China. Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises? I'm all ears. Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later. Don't tell me: you're from outer space. ... Who are you? Wanna try it from the top? You got a pocket pager? What are you, a doctor? What's that? Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived. Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that. Damn. Sorry, the time would have to be right now. My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe? Where could you take them? I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral. Thanks. Cheers. You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift. See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them. They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there. ... You're very perceptive. Just lucky, I guess. Good. A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob. Do you trust me? He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat? How did you know Gracie's pregnant? Nobody knows that. Or believe, I'll bet. Then -- All right. Who are you? and don't jerk me around any more. I want to know how you know that. Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here. It means that they will be at risk from whale hunters -- same as the rest of the humpbacks. What did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the Institute about extinction? They're gonna hafta take their chances. Go ahead. A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type. Uh huh. What about you? Where you from? Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it. You've already been that. C'mon. LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales. I buy that. What about him? Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh? The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales... Ohhh kay . I don't know what this is about, but I want you guys outta here right now or I call the cops. Soon... It's too bad because they're very friendly as you can see. I've grown quite attached to them... This way. Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day! Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea. They are mature humpbacks, weighing 45,000 pounds each. They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here. We call them George and Gracie. To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.I live here, remember? You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what? Well? I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all. Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man. And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something... I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it? I know exactly what you mean. Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you. You weren't gonna say goodbye? We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two... Looks like a tie. Your watch. And that's one! You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back. That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round! That's up to you. Take something off. True. The big one. The one that's most on your mind. You say the truth. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha? Want to play the game? Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time... It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off. It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play. I like to play "reality". I sit. I think. I play games. Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe. Only when you're depressed. Then it passes. You don't believe that. Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes. You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which. What? What do you want? I don't think so, but if that's what you want... Do what, show you a good time? Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in. You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part. Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen. That's what you get flight pay for. That's not what I hear. The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you? This is it, then. ...they say you're alright. Where'd you get it. What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross. Doesn't it ever bother you? Danger? I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies. I'm still second best. In that order? I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work. No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone. I want it understood. You always get what you want? And now? I don't know. I don't like being out of control. Where? You're totally insane. It's just as I thought. Are you really that brave? What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about... Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it. What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result." Winston Churchill. You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die. Does it bother you? You ever think about killing another human being? You don't have to kill it. You're horrible No! I don't enjoy watching things suffer. You're an animal. Why'd you do that? Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work. Make what? I'm starting to sense that now. Used to what? Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it. What about the plane? Hard to argue with that, isn't it... How about what? And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune... You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens. Uh hum. You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe. Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do? Maverick...you know the rules of engagement. Lieutenant... I can't. Yes. I'll give you that! I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional. There you go with those moves again. Apology acknowledged. For what? And far too aggressive. You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying. No. You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference? It never came up. The what? Two miles. If you were directly above him, how did you see him? He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six? Where were you? Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you. It's what? Where did you see that? You saw a MiG 21? Why not? I beg your pardon. That's all! How did you know this was my car? What if Captain Dawson had come with me? Yeow! I'm with someone. Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots? And on to a bigger one with you? How so? That's a big comfort to me. It isn't? Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous. Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer. I'll bet!Like what? On what? Why do they call you Wolf? Why do you all have such funny names?I love that. That's my type. He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane? Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil. ...because there are no interesting single men at this party! Oh, good... ...any sister talk? Great. Yeah. Uh -- A lot of works. That's just -- Great. Oh, yeah. What are your favorite buildings, David? Oh-- Yeah. Wha-- What kind of things do you build? Oh. Well, let's hope so. Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, cr�pes caviar. We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi. Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting? I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing. Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me. He wants to take me to see Rigoletto. No, he called late last night. Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say. Oh, uh, listen, David called me up. Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money. Well, sometimes, some, uh... If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah? Well, wait. You know what? I know. Uh... Well, I live downtown. Oh, geez, yeah. Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though. ...a monstrosity! Who would do that? It feels like you're in France. It's French, though. It really is. It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes. Oh, is that what it is? Oh, it's magnificent! Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit. Mmm. No, really, I really like him a lot. I mean, I've looked everywhere.Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No? Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap. I know, I know, and your hamster. Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us. No. Yes, please. Yeah. What? You're just realizing this now? Yeah...but you're not dying! Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating. Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious... It was on your shirt! Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma. But you don't have any symptoms! I don't know. Cancer, I-- Well, he has to rule out certain things. But there's nothing wrong with you. Mickey, come on, we got a show to do! But not you. You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em. Hello? Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes. Yeah? In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number? Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.I can't believe it! Mmm? Oh, listen... Come in, come in. Mm-mm! It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost. You matter to me. Completely. Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them? Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us. Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you? I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you...do you find me too...too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something? Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life? What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed! Are you? Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me? Are you in love with someone else? Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage? Are you angry with me? Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos. But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get? I want one with you. Well, tell me. Should I be worried? Why do you say that? Is there something wrong? Why not? Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat. Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me. Are you in a bad mood? It's so late. Where're you going? Holly and April, thanks for helping. Mmm. God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him? I know. Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these. She has all the cooking talent. I know! I know! Aren't they great? Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them. Oh, Mom! It's on the table, Dad. Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it? Don't make it worse, Dad. Hi. How's she doing? ...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest. I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage... I am... I did slave all day. Get his wine away. I know, she...she really writes good dialogue. Yeah? What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay? Oh, now-- What do--? You're being ridiculous. I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions. Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult. Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months. Y-yeah. I'm okay. I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- Do you miss Frederick? So how are you? ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive. I hope you tell her it was your idea... Oh, yeah? How's she doing? Hi. Where's Holly? Oh, yeah? Doesn't she look pretty? You look so beautiful. Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere. You've outdone yourself. Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs? Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that. W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination. Just think about it. That's all I ask. I want to experience childbirth. Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen. You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor. Well, what about artificial insemination? I don't know. Excessive masturbation? Could you have ruined yourself somehow? This is the second opinion. Is there no chance? Wow! Football! Oh! That's a beauty! Thanks, thanks. You know, he's been wanting a mitt. That's really nice! I know, I know. Ohh! Yeah. I think so. I think he'll find that satisfying. Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play. He's fine. Here, you guys. Open them up. Everything's good. Everything's fine. Huh? Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you. Very good. Glad you could put in an appearance. Hi! Hi! True. Now, Holly's not shy. I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know? I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things. Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?! Okay, okay. Okay, stop being so dramatic. You promised to stay on the wagon. Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting. ...from Mavis, also. I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you. I don't...I don't want to bother everyone. Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private! You're grateful, but you resent me. You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient? Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off? No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us? It's obviously based on Elliot and me. I'm real upset about what you wrote. Take...take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play. Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore. Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write. You're crazy! That's not true. You're too demanding. I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would-- Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice. How? I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean-- No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things. Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting? Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively... Well, that...th-that's fine. Oh, God... Oh, gosh. Oh, what do they know? Boy-- Awwww... Hey, hi! Look, everything's going your way. What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything? I hope. ...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something? No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take... Uh-huh. No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that. I know, no-- I know. Ohh! No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing. Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung. Really? Singing? You found all this, all this out on one date? Oh? Oooo. Oh-oh. HOLLY ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic. Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you. Oh! Here. Be careful with those. He's the headmaster of Daisy's school. He's not a loser at all! It's, uh, you never know-- Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep! When does Frederick ever come with her? Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around. Don't you think she does? Doesn't she look great in that new dress? Ohh? Are we talking about cocaine again? Will you just tell me one thing? Yeah. Uh-huh. I know. H-how much do you need? Holly, please. Don't insult me. Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm? Oh, sure. Perfect! What? You're kidding!Gee, um... I...I don't know what to say. But I'm seeing him. And you, you-you're going? I, uh, I'm very surprised. You're joking. What? Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health. I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised. I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um... Uh... It depends on what way you want to go. Yeah, I, we both live downtown. Okay. Yeah. It's really terrible. That's disgusting! Yeah. Right. Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know. Oh! Wow, it's the red one? We're a big hit. Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane. No, really, we mustn't get discouraged. I know. It's terrible! Oh, okay. Yes. Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it? Oh, gee, I don't know. Um... Fast. Yeah. And it ruins everything else. Yeah. ...and open the French doors and go on the balcony -- Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown... Uh-huh. It's terrific! Yeah. Oh, what, what do you do? We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried... What makes you think we're more interesting? Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company. Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams. Really? Is the food that bad? We're actresses. Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs? Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em? No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry. That's the point. I'd like to be bothered. Well, why don't you share them with us? Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems. Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong. Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful." Wow, I guess I hit a nerve. Well-- Oh, so loosely. My script? Hey, what's the matter? Good. What's the matter? What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden? Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre. You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with! Uh, losers! All losers! Hmm! You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm. You treat me like a loser. Yeah, you mean not at my age. Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging. Yeah, that's clerical. Well-well, like what? But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just...crazy! I've got...an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even. Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. You got it. They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means. So what's new? Well, I just came from an audition... Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why. Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing! Boy, you really know how to cut me down. Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it. Yeah. W-why? You don't think it's realistic? Easily. Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song. I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I-- You know. Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well? Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh... Yeah, can you believe it? I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it. Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition? ...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so... ...and then she just breaks down. And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently. I mean... Sometimes she's terrific... He's married... Oh, yeah. Well, how about this? You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed. You know what I'm saying? HANNAH Oh, no, not at all. Ouch! Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's. Not this Thanksgiving, you know. Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH Listen. He's a lot better than your ex-husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything. Oh, he's such a loser! He's such a loser! Oh, Hannah! Oh, your kids are so adorable. Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out! Frederick didn't come with her. I should get a garter belt. She really does, though. Yeah. Uh-oh. I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties. Okay. Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding. You admit that we're great cooks, right? Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great. Two thousand dollars. Someday, I'll pay it all back. This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts. Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset. Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately? Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties. No, no, we decided! I'm pregnant. Mickey? Tch. Thanks. Just a few minutes ago. Okay. Hi. Yeah. Sure. Sure, uh, yes. It's all right. That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself. Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and that's this. Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now. Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and... God, you really liked it?! Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life. Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh... Oh, wow! Oh, God! Oh! Right. Oh, gosh, you really think I can write? Oh, it just came to me one day. Really? No, you can tell me straight. It's okay. Just, you know, tell me what you think. Oh, well. Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe. Oh, gosh, I don't know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you? So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one. Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know. ...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I-- Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh... But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. Well, it's not my first script. Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion. Oh, I'm fine. You're okay, though, huh? Oh. Oh. You're kidding me. I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so-- No, I haven't. No, the reason I ask is-- Really? Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right? Come on. Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this. Yeah. No, well...I've been trying to write. Probably not. ...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all. Oh, nothing much. You know... I'm okay. Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed. Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired... People change...you know. Oh, well, that was a long time ago. I'd never do that. Yeah, it was. Yeah? Oh, no. I'm fine. How are you? We didn't hit it off. Yeah. I recall you. I remember you. God! You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately. Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out. This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed! At least I'm open to new concepts! I was so bored! Thanks for a swell time. Eh, Mickey, it's getting late. Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person. Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong. I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you? No! Come on, Mickey. Come on. You want some? Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy! The room's alive with positive vibrations! Listen, you are witnessing genius! Oh, why are you making those faces? Why are you so upset? I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you? Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat? Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe. Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning? ...which I did not get. Dad! Dad... Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt. God. Mm-hm. Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning. Oh, my God. Thank you.Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big. Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love. Uh-huh. Yeah? Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah. Hi, Dusty. Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over! I care a great deal about him, yes. Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else. It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know. I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever. Look, I'm just as much at fault. It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore. Oh, not here. There are too many people around. No. I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me. I know she must be a really passionate person. Oh, all the time. I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah. That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else. I know it isn't. I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called. I didn't sleep all night. I almost didn't. Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned. Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street! Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close. Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right? I can't say anything! Poor Hannah. But not over me? Why? Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus-- Not because of me, I hope. Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing. What do you expect me to say? Why, you know the situation. Oh, don't say those words! Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing? I was looking for you. Elliot! What are you doing?! Elliot! Don't! Did you ever read this one--? Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic. They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS. Yes, he's just adorable. Isn't that beautiful? Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect. Yeah. Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended... Oh. Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you. I have to get my teeth cleaned this week. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend. Bye. Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would. Well, thanks a lot. Well, sure. Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this. No, I don't think so. Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much. Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean...you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio? I'm...all right. Everything's okay? Yes? No? You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay? No, I don't have time. Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read. What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book? Isn't this great? They have everything here. Yeah, sure. Yeah, you would. Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore. Oh, God. Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know. Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on. Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol. Yes, I do. Oh. Well, I live-- Ohhhh! You're out looking here? Oh, what, in this section of town? What are you doing here? Oh, Elliot! ...ex-husband on the street the other day. I don't know exactly. Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings. Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He uh, sold a picture. Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me. Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that-- Oh, God, I don't even know what I want. Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late. It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out! What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met! But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this! Yeah. I'm saying it now! I'm sorry. Stop accusing me! No. No. Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try. I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while. Because I have to! Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out. Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating! I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not. I can't take this anymore. Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten. What's the problem? Oh, Frederick! Big. Frederick, show him the oils. Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's husband. And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent. Based on what? You never even see him. Me? Mmm you never know. They might. He's just trying to do the nice thing. Mm-hm. ...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else. Mmm... You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet. God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself. Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? Are you sure? How about something to eat? Want some coffee or tea? Yeah. I'll get some ice. Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote? It was great. She's really developed. I think we need to eat. I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache. She's going through a really rough time right now. Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?! You are, Holly. Stop it. Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that. Like what? Oh... Really? You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot. How are you? No. Oh, me, I'm okay. Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all. Why? Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late. He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. I bumped into your... Come on. Oh, great. Okay. I think they're fantastic. You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating. Boy...Holly...Holly. Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we? Hmm. April? Hi. Oh... Where are the antihistamines? Yeah. Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here. At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice? I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back. No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'... You wouldn't like it, either if you had it. He thinks you want him to look at evidence. You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone? Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you? Let's forget who said what to whom... Maybe we should give it some time... That's not true. Will? You could come up here. I came up here after Kevin's father died. They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too. It's what Kevin called her when he was little... Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days... Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and... I want to see you, too. Will? Are you okay? I was out in the garden. Mama came out and told me when she saw it on TV. Why didn't you call me? Will... William: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed. Is Crawford going with you? What will you do? And... where are things? Can you quit? Then why? Have you ever omitted telling me. things before? I'd like one of your cigarettes, please. Can I have one of your cigarettes? Do you remember what you said? You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong? He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face. You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... He's after you now, isn't he? I love you... Blue is cold. Yellow's a bad color for me. I'll look green at breakfast. I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there? To do what? Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered. Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing. Which part? That or the day-to-day. Me, too. And very erotic... At the store. You doin' some good? Hello, hotshot! Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night. Huh? Will? Is that you? Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me. And Kevin. That's selfish, huh? What you've already decided. You're not really asking. All the things that happened to you before make you know that... You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma. You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that... I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone. He asked how you are. He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.It's Dragon. Dragon... Red Dragon. The Tooth... Am I alone in this room? Are you here... Why are you doing this?! Francis...? Who? Who is it? You'll come by? Are you okay...? I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over? Francis? Where are you? I'm fine, Francis. I'll get my purse. My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too? Good morning... If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee... I'm fine. Is that you. D? That was nice of you to think of that. Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? I'll probably go back to it someday. You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children... They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract. In the kitchen. Come on in. How about a gin and tonic? Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time. No, thanks. I manage very well. I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow. The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code. It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? Let me stick this in the black hole. When do you need it? What's being photographed? Can you give me an idea of the conditions... Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore. After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing. It's that jerk Walter. Aren't we a little old for that? I bet Dolores told Charlie. Come on. What's with you and Michael? Just what you underlined. All right. What's the scoop? Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are. That's because you' re not a total moron like they are. I'll call you Later. We're going to take you home. Were taking you back to the nurse. Go on. You can do it. They're waiting. Come on. The only one? Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants... Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz can still dance. Wouldn't we all. After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious. You should have left here years ago, like I did. So he started having affairs, and you got depressed. You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage. Welcome to the singles scene. You're probably the only one who could carry it off. Peggy Sue! Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night! You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie. ) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty�six. I hear she does more than talk with her mouth. Charlie really has a great voice. Why do guys do such stupid things? Lucky lady. Hi.Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. Jack, I was just trying to help. Does everybody have to hear? Please don't shout. You have four seasons, you have four slumps. A new car. We can't afford a new car. Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light�headed. Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards. What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married. What does Charlie think about that? You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you. Isn't that awfully forward? Would they go over my girdle or under? I'm not the maid! Where have you been? You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. Maddy's party. Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it. Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing? That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning. Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter. Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are. What happened to you? Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it? Would you get that, dear? It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today? What about? What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?. When did you start drinking coffee? You're looking pretty chipper this morning. What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up? My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. Of course, dear. You're home now. Why don't you go lie down for a while. How do you feel? The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.Do you have to wear that hat? I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before? What does Grandma think you do at your meetings? Good�bye, Grandma. Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do? That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore. I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something. Do you believe in all of that? I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people. I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change. Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town. Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie? Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think? But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies. How do you like my hair? This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her. Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you. Welcome to the singles' scene. What happened? What's the matter? Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party. That loud�mouthed little bitch~ You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair. Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts? On what? He does? He is kind of cute, isn't he? I don't get it. Yes. Let's stay in touch. That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way. Maddy, what did you do to your hair? Where is it? I can't. It's all too much. Well, besides Charlie, of course. Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left? Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently. It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust. We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things. I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie. 1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun. Carol! Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell. Then hold me. You were terrific. And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up. Charlie, I had a strange experience. I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you. And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why". It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him. What about Janet? Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you. You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old. Charlie? Was I dead? I'm trying. I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years. I've got to go now. Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed? I know. Oh, Charlie. Will you take me back to my grandparents? I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that. You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless. What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice. How could you possibly know what I've been going through? Let me got! Where are you taking me? Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there. What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here? Forget it, it'll never work. It means I care about you and what happens to you. Just take a look at it. Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest. Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you. I'd forgotten how much music meant to you. What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group. I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific. Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell.. Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school? I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog. I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me. Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish. That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different! I just can't trust you anymore. That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet. Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy. And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you? You know I never could stand your sarcasm. I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride. What are you doing here? Charlie. I just had the strangest dream. What am I going to do with you? Why? But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand. Charlie. About last nights.. What do you know about classical music? I'm sorry Charlie. This is a mistake. We better forget it. You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing! I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out? A lot's happened since last weekend. Charlie, let's make love. You really love me, don't you? Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you. You're pretty charming when you want to be. Come on, let's dance. He's trying. Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik? Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen? Charlie, how are you? Right. I promised my mother. It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world. Where did you get that sweater? Good. Rejected, worthless, miserable. I thought it had a lot of merit. Thanks. Would you? They'll learn to live with it. Why wait? Maybe I blocked it out. Refresh my memory. Oh yeah? You drive like a maniac! Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years. Pretty strange. Charlie! Am I dead? Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight? I know. Put Scott through college. I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them. Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here. I'm still waiting for the mortgage check. There's something pathetic parked in front of my house. Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off. I can't. I'm too embarrassed. Charlie... Don't say that... Have a nice day. I beg your pardon? Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky. Touchy, touchy! Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion. First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out. Test? It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings. My children make me happy. I miss them so much. Beth. Scott and Beth. I'm going to name my daughter after you. But I'm remembering the future. I wish she hadn't. Fine. ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel? I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun. Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants. He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet. She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth? Don't get your hopes up. Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band. It was Beth's idea. What? I thought I knew everything about him. Ssh. He's great. It's Charlie! Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it. That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer. Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me. I hate chickens. I can't do that. Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah? For everyone. I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something. I'd love to. Is that one of your poems? I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance. They care about you. They're just a different generation. Don't you get along with your parents? What are you shooting for? Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here. Hey, man, I'm a hip chick. Coffee and a donut. The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today. Maybe you're confusing his life with his work. You don't? I was impressed with what you said in English class today. Oh, you're both so naive. Oh no! How did it go with the pantyhose? Wrong, Dad. Your idea. You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night. Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think? He'll win. But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats. Yes. The hat business is in trouble. Quiet today? I wanted to apologize for this morning. I closed my Christmas club. Open it. Hi, Dad. Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox! Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school. I think they're going to deregulate it. I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell. Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please. Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young? At my age? Don't be silly. It's not Charlie. It's me. I think I'm way ahead of them. Mom, is there any coffee left? That would be impossible. Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor. Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles. Just a little. I've had a tough day. He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit. Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school? You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie. No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell�O. Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta? We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come. Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather. Way to go, Mom! I went for a drive. Up in the hills. I don't feel very festive. For what? What do you mean? I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them. I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize. She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right? I had a dream that Grandma died. It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma. Sure, Mom. Hello. It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch. Who was that man? The house payments. Sort of. Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him? Oh. Ah...recently. All the kids drink it. I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health. Oh. I forgot. Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young. I'm home now. Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. Mom! I'm excused. I have a note. Mom! Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist. Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this. You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself. They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. Don't eat the red ones. It's unbelievable. The man never ages. Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders? I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life. I'm just happy to see you. Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop. But accidents can happen. I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself. I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous. You have an incredible memory. Rosalie Testa! You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian. No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard. Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time. Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now. You were meant to You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I came to say goodbye. You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here. It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out. Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out. God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here? That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back? Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself. I couldn't help it �� I loved him. Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen. No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time. No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young. We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway... I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that. Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set... Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure. Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it? What do you know about hypnosis? Like what? For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode. It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time. Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night. Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging. Hi, Richard. The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech. Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful? Oh. And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous. You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about. Not for you. Okay, there's lots more. There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life�styles. Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair. When do we start? Sixty�forty. Wbat're you talking about? Give me some credit, will you? How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people? Richard, take it easy. I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me. I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here. I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life! What if it's beyond science? What it it's God? What're you doing? Am I dead or not? Come on, Richard, I'm serious. That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died. I don't know. Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969. You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things. This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years. Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise? So you think time travel is possible? For people? What's inside? I know what a burrito is. What's that? Sort of. I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible? What a great kite. It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please? I have to talk to you. It's very important. Congratulations on the math contest, Richard. You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while. You're a sweet man, Richard. What was? Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife. He's not here. We're getting divorced. Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now. I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this. I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
