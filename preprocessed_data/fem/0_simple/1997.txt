Corn-i-Lius? Tell me... Why?... Why would you need me? I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life. But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own. ...Like love... What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them! I want to sleep... forever... I'm so tired... ...The rain falls... The wind blows... the fire burns... Protect life... Until death. Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy... I'm so very sad. You're nothing but a... a... And you can't concentrate with me around?. I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad? OK, you can turn around! Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women. You know women normally change five times more than men. ...Hoppi-hoppa. Good! Do you know how we say "make love"? Apipoussan! Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine! All 900. Learning language. What is... Make Love? Love... Apipoulai! Dinoine chagantakat! Cornelius.. Valo massa... Chacha hamas. Apipoulai!Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands! You little sleaze bag! Have you pulled yourself together? They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead! You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two! I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it? ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!! Are you listening to me, you ingrate! I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes. You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town. No. I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league. This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh? Has anybody offered to buy it? About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately? Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question. Who? Who? Always has been. Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral. Are you alright, Wade? Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?I want to go home. Oh. You're a policeman. That's illegal, you know. I want to go home. What are you sorry for? Okay. Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want? Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says -- Nothing. No. Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you. Oh. Pop? It's pretty old. Are we going in this? Dad. That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here. Yes. Yes. Yes. I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me. See, I knew you'd be mad. I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me. Yes. I called Mommy. I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home. No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home. No. I want to go home. I don't like it here. It's stupid. It's not that. I don't want to. No. She doesn't talk about you anymore. I just think you used to be bad. I bet you did lots of bad things. But it's not funny now. Was it funny? Did you do that when you were a kid? Yeah. It's stupid. You know. Why do they do that? I don't care. They're out. Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out. Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.Don't be silly. Hi, Jill. I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat. I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you? What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way? What happened? Wade. How? Think they're alright? Are you sure they're home? Did you call? I know your parents. Did you tell them? That we were coming? Alright. I'll think about it. You've been married twice -- Oh, Wade. Then... I guess you have to. Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now? It's nice. What way? You knew me as a kid. But not now. You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money. The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt? Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him? Jack doesn't need money. Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose? ...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else. I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her... Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks. Okay. Call me. No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you. You don't mean that. I'm sorry. About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian? I'm sorry about what I said. You okay? You okay? Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break. You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off. How's she doing? New hat? Jill's up, I see. Can --? When did she die? Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that? You're not using it today? Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.Can't it wait, then? Something about my father? Mrs. Gordon. Thank you. He's asleep. We were up very late. Who are you?Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man. I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem. Yes. Do you mind if I ask you a personal question? Kiss me. Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health. That's very clever. Do you know any other poems? How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham? Care for some saki? In Japan, men come first and women come second. May I wash you? Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know. Come in. It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable. Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know? You may. What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it? I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.I love you, Vanessa. No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone. I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had. Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery. Of course not. I was married to your father. Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out. You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted. Because you managed to resist Austin Power's charms. I'm proud of you. You didn't... How's Austin? Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?Kiss me. I love you, Austin. I have something to tell you. I'll secure the perimeter. Austin, I'm coming with you. Are you crazy? I believe you, Austin. Let's go. Likewise. Oh, behave! Austin, what's your point? I'll hurry back. I'm not going anywhere. We're a team. What do we do now? Shut up. Yes. Indeed. No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge. Sadly, no. Hold on! I always keep this on me just in case. Not now, Austin. Thank God, Austin, we made it. Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges. I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch. You know who. Do you think she's prettier than I? I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional. Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night. Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang. You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely. Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. Not in the Nineties. No, did you use a condom? I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection? Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry. Austin, may I have a word with you? Really, Austin! It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about. What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know. I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver. I am not. Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. Why? I haven't had fun like that since college. Go! Just go! Watch out, you're on my hair! I couldn't have another bite. I hate having my picture taken. Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped. I don't get it. We can't just sit here, Austin. Let's go get him! How do you know? A limousine has just pulled up. Why? Do you want to talk to him? Why did you leave so soon? Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're prescription X-ray glasses. I have very bad astigmatism. Here, use mine. I'm sure. No, actually. I don't know how to put this really. Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry. Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this. I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever. If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you. I hope this is part of the unfreezing process. What? Sure. We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. A Chigro? Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. I'm sorry? Excuse me? I beg your pardon? I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport. My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much. My mother's told me all about you. Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967. I'm on with a friend! Look, I'd better go. I love you. You didn't answer my question, Mum. Did you ever want to? Did you ever... I just don't see it. What about his teeth? Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre. Why? Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch. He's asleep. Great.His peritoneum has ruptured... 90 over 50 and falling... . I've got a pulse, he's alive... You didn't hear it? You must have heard it! What's happening...? Nothing. It's nothing. Starck! "The dark inside..."? I don't understand. What does? What, Justin, what shows you? I'll get back to the log. But on the bridge, I won't go back, back in there... Justin. I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up. I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin... Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay. Skipper... Crystallized. Frozen. I found one. Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact. Okay. I'm on the bridge. There's no one here, Skipper. I can see the hatch. I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing... That means they didn't abandon ship. Jesus its huge. We've got pressure. No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer. Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months. Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers. Good for four months. I've seen bodies before. This is different. About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... I did. There's no one here. Blood. Looks like arterial spray. Dr. Weir, what's this the door to? Here's another one. They're all over the place. DJ! It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe. They attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for Titan. The shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. There was a spark and both ships were incinerated. The Skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. Captain Miller was able... He served on the Goliath. Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach. First time in a grav couch? I don't care. You got any coffee? We have to do something, oh God... Come on, Baby-bear, open this door... Do you know what it was? Yes. Yes, Justin, we heard it. Can you shut it down? There's no one in the corridor but us.Run! Hurry. I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert... There must be a way! What about Engineering? You're okay now, it's over... I don't know, the screens are dead...! It is not. Weir. Miller, he's back, he was in the tank... I'll do it -- Blow it up? We've got to shut it down, we've got to... Weir can't be alive. Five seconds. You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door. He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit. Justin's in the airlock. Miller, come in... Nine hours and twenty-two minutes. I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have. I know that. It's not bullshit, it's the only conclusion the data supports... I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us... You've got to listen... There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system... I've got a theory. ...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin... Miller... Who? Maybe one of the original crew? I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins. What's the point? I'll just get the same thing... I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew. The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels. I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home. It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot. Oxygen is not the problem. The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us. It tastes bad. We're all here. That's an affirmative. There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location. Something's wrong with the bio-scan. Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees. I just finished drying... Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes. We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready. It's cold. Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay... Almost got it. Keep him talking. He's engaged the override. Not according to the computer. What if the air has gone bad? We can't wear these suits forever. I'm trying, goddammit -- Miller, do you read me, Peters -- Decompression wouldn't do that. What happened to his eyes? Picking up magnetic interference. The scope is lit, it's right in front of us... If they are, they're screening their calls. This is U.S. Aerospace Command vessel Lewis and Clark, hailing Event Horizon, Event Horizon, do you read...? This is the Lewis and Clark, hailing... The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel... All boards are green, everything's five by five. Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own. Justin said something about, "The dark inside me..." What did he mean? Miller, Smith, Cooper, any of you in the airlock? What is it? In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset. What are you doing? Maybe a power interruption crashed the system... I'm sorry. It must be hard, being so far away from her. Claire is your wife? Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love. I can't believe we built this. I don't know. The life readings just went off the scale. What is it? If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense. Affirmative. The hull's intact... but there's no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I'm showing deep cold. The crew couldn't survive unless they were in stasis. The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious. A straight line. How?Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch. My office will follow up with details. Jumping off, now... "Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure? Jordan, dear. How are they treating you? Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway? Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m. From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. This my shade? "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here. Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee? I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts. -- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing. Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases -- She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from -- Yes? Think I overplayed it? I'll act surprised. That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. Never. I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes. Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm? The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so happens. You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right? "The Lark Report." Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point... Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that... Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. Don't play politics with me, little darlin'. You'd be up way past your bedtime. You'll think about my offer? I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable. I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always use a hard-charger on my team. The reality is this: We send far too many men off to war. I don't need to compound the problem with women. Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with -- Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory. I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags. In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same. What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way. Should probably ask him that. Wickwire was there to help. To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. At least that was the intent. Absolutely not. Jordan. Might we do this over lunch tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely -- Sounds familiar. Jordan. I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that -- Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered. But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base. Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person. There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter. And your success would mean a lot. Jumping, now... Yes, dear. My office will fill him in and help expedite. Look forward to meeting you at the proper time. Jumping off now... This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat. Or, actually, its official non-policy. Now who's your immediate superior there? California. High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia. Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote. So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.What'd you find, Kathy? Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"? "Wickwire, Thomas Dane." See what you can find. Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order? Don't say my name. But are there... I mean, how many... The woman I saw you with... I don't know if there's any single reason. But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den. It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!" Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong. Made me mad. And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster. "Gee, I wish I were a man." Who's "we"? That's what I hear. Thank you, ensign. Sir? What did he say? Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there? Sir. If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward? Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud... I'm saying, we're just friends. Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong. Permission to leave, sir? Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this. Not this article, not -- See me, sir? So I'll get a fair shot? Wouldn't dream of it, sir. Across the board, sir. Same rules for everyone, sir. The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench. No, sir. I think you've resented me from the start, sir. Pardon? I can't afford civility, sir. How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider? Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..." I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base? It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment. It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met. It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here. Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way. Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement. I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect. None at this time, sir. Really, I have no problem with -- Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only -- Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain amount of pain. I'm fine, sir. Thank you, sir. West? Newberry, get a photo. South? Fine by me, sir! Ah, c'mon... Sir... You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him. I'm sure it is. You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too? I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been. So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble. You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did. What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more? You don't know that. So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon? If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras. What changed? Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to see me fail? It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me. You know him. Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire. Uh, ma'am. Can't complain, ma'am. Would I be the only one? The only woman? Uh, question, ma'am. Captain Dwyer. Technically. I know that, sir. Ma'am. It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training? "Coronado." Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding? Spotted you, Chief. Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows. Over. Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water. Go, GO! Fuck. Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix... Hey. You okay, Flea? Do that. Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me. But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway. It's just gonna hurt us both, okay? So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size? Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"? Sir? Come on, Montgomery... Just do it, okay? I can make this wall without -- Just a coincidence? I was looking for him earlier, but... The Navy Cross... What "all females"? If I'm the only -- I'll try anyway, sir. Thank you, sir. But I like these just fine. Which is guy-speak for... So here we are again. Staring three years of operational duty in the face. Yeah. Me too. You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country. He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere. Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado... "In Washington..." I don't know, I don't care. Sounds like an amazing coincidence. Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right? What about him. I'm tired of fighting back. I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay? It's done with, Royce. Let it go. No shortage of suspects. Maybe. Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it. Almost like... Did I say he was class officer? All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay. Sure. I'll join the crowd. Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce. Well, let me warm you: I'm going though with this. The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish. So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay? You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too. So why are you telling me this? I saw an article... Me? Why me? I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men. But hey, what'd I expect? It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life. Thank you, Royce. It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much. You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know. Which is guy-speak for... Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then? Sorry. But after our days... So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here? Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you. This has nothing to do with you. You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits. I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling. Royce. We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy? I take it you don't either. Feet. Just like you would be. Is this my glory, sir? Hate this part. Just sweating it out on the sidelines. Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon? Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. Why not? Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride. Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan: Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub. But don't waste time opening and closing hatches. They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters. Unless you Whiskey Run. North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice. Where's The Polk? Chances of recovery? Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy? Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got? Lieutenant O'Neil. This is insane. You've got no proof. We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta. Just, you know, nothing special. Do you, uh, know... Thanks for lying. But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up. Besides... I can't go out. Not like this. First big night of liberty and no date? You're pathetic, Wickwire. Sorry, didn't mean to -- Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me... How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? You got anybody, Wick? He was married? That's a good story. They had to kill 'em? If you got a good one, Wick... You really came back for more? Of this? Wick. They got your crew, too? Who is it? Thanks, Wick. I didn't know they let you try again. Especially at your age. And how do you know that? Whose orders were those? Well, now I feel so much better. Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it. Cortez, help him. Flea? You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead. So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each. 'Cool? How much air in yours? 'Cool? I'm lookin', I'm lookin'! If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area. Now how smart is that? I don't know... What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist? How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they -- What're you guys doing? Huh? Shut up, sir. I'm concentrating. Show us where you are, Chief. 15, sir. Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes. What's your air situation? Over. Good to see you again, too, sir. Sure. Just like your men do. No. We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position. I think you're the liar. That's not right. No. Yes. I mean, depends on -- Wasn't deemed a threat. Should I be afraid? Green Eggs and Ham. You're not going to get anywhere. You might as well put me in the cage. Dick, Jane, and Spot. "Dad." McCool's that same rank. We're both j.g.'s. It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead. I see. So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft. Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross. May I ask what you got it for? Permission to get dressed, sir? Chief, sir, I don't understand why -- Say again, sir? Shut your hole, Slutnik. FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for? Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear. Try a wrench on that thing. MOVE! All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site. Ready? North? Listen, Sex Ape. I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file. That your desk? I'll take this one. Funny, the C.O. says I can. Anybody usin' these drawers here? Your new roommate.I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform. Thanks. I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it? This looks pretty good on me. Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on. But you're not going to stop her? He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her? Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman. Fine. Can you do it or not? 'Course I do -- I deliver money for him. Help you get Ordell Robbie. Take your time. I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit. That's my diet shit. Beauty products. My pocketbook. Help yourself. I'm not a loser. Arrest me. I'm not saying another word. If I were to tell you "no it isn't..." Suspicion of what? Would I mind? Do I have a choice? I doubt it. Who's your friend? The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air. Are you scared of me? I thought you were tired of your business? Sure I can't twist your arm? Wanna go? Start off in Madrid. Ever been there? Spain. I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money. Do you blame yourself for helping me? We're partners. I never lied to you. I didn't use you, Max. They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car? I told him I might. He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does. I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement. You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want. Only this isn't a bail bond, Max. Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note. I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail. Well, we don't let that happen, now do we? He's already there. Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared. I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that. Tell him I want to give him his money. Uh-huh. Get Ordell to come to your office. It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell. That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe? Ray wants him. He's liable to shoot you. How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't? How'd you find out? Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on. That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room. Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried. Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke. He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top. In the bag underneath. Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand. Don't be so literal. Ray believed it. All he needed was a reasonable explanation. Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them. I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in. That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you. It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money. What if I've figured a way? If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it? I'm not sure you answered my question. And is that it? Did you do it that night? You do that? What do you do when he comes home? Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house? The day you got me out of jail? When did you decide? Why? You're avoiding the question. You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed. No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else. What about you Max? He tries to act cool. He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire. Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words. You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it. He's setting me up to make a proposition. Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself. I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me. Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags. I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him. Right around here, in the food court. He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag. Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here. They seem to like the idea. I go back to work tomorrow. How old's Annette? Why? Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute. Who was your girl before Annette? And Annette's it for you? Does it happen to all men? Oh, are you? Does she know that? How was it? What'd ya see? I know, ignoring me. What're you up to? Surprise. Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote? Yeah. My ass ain't the same. It's different with men. How'd you feel about it? Really? I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you? How do you feel about getting old? I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again. If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em. Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work. He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar? He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can. We talked. He came by. He told me last night. It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in. I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money. I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens. I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available. '74, I think. The Delfonics. Uh-huh. I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records. I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair. Want to hear some music? Yeah. What, I couldn't hear you? Thanks, but I have my own now. I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail. I am. Have a seat. I think maybe I have more options than I thought. But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with. Yeah, if I cooperate. Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer. That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope. It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash? With ten thousand? Nine. I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that. I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in. It was the other guy who busted me. Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. I didn't? The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont. Ordell pick up his bond? That's him. How do you know 'em? Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me. I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke. Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that. Sure. Shit. So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right? You're not tired of it? She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are. Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat. That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand. You gain weight? 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me. That doesn't sound dark. Is it dark? I'd love one, but not there. Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven? I don't think so. Can we stop for cigarettes? Who put up my bond? Ordell? Can I see your I.D.? Are you really a bail bondsman? Okay. If I don't cooperate? What if I plead guilty? Who's side are you on? You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them. Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you. You know what's in the bag you're taking? Then you don't see him for a few days? Not every day? Do you live together? Do you think I took some of that money? What about me? So what happens now? I thought you were watching him. If it'll make you happy. I have no idea. I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie? Not in the fitting room. I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling. I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do. She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform. Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it. I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home. I thought I did. Si. How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second? That would be one point of view. Yes. All those things are true. Uh-huh. Ever been tempted? I never have. It's not my money. I was told ten thousand in each pack. We could, if I'm not in jail. You said that the last time. Right. Everything's the same, except one change... Uh-huh. She didn't say. Uh-huh. I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont. I'm sure that was the idea. It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell. White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's. Not yet. I imagine shit needs to be done. What for? Not really. This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out. Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis. A Broadway shopping bag. I thought you were going to let this one through. What are you doing? Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity. He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him? No. He sells guns. You never asked me if I did or not. If I'm working, I can help you. I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job. Can I smoke? Look, that shit ain't mine. You planted that shit on me. What the fuck is that shit? Yeah? Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store. I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us? Do you got something for me? Yeah, do you like it? Hi, Melanie. I don't think so, but thanks for the beer. Keep it between us girls? Dreaming. Kinda. Beaumont Livingston? He said he didn't know about it. That coke was yours, wasn't it? What were you two fighting about? How long you been with Ordell? Uh-uh. Killian's. Sure. Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway. I'm waiting for the phone. Oh, hi. He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money. Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it. And a hundred thousand if I go to jail. If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you. Ray, the A.T.F. guy. Where you gonna be during all this? The fitting room. There's a sign over the door. Designer clothes. Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's/May. She knows what I look like? What does she think she's gettin? Are you sure she don't know about the money? It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall. Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills. Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it. I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this. I was there, I saw her do it. Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout. I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all. I need to talk to you alone. Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up. Who? The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet? Plus the same deal as before. That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent. I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent. Well, it's my plan. We're in this together. I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court. Can you cover that? That's the idea. No, I give it to someone else first. The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before... If you want. I don't know. One of your friends. If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone. You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is. ...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill. They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in. It's true, isn't it? I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here. Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You. They already know it's you. I told them. I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you. I do okay. It's a cockatoo. It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick... The Cockatoo Inn. I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on. I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea. All your money's in Mexico. One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand. It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail. Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me. Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me? Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down. Go sit over in that chair. I said, you understand what I'm saying Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying? The cops didn't try and strangle my ass. Shut your ass up and grab the wall! You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga. What do you think it is? They told me. I didn't tell 'em anything. And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker. Beaumont Livingston. I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer. They asked. The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot. For what? Sure. Yeah. I got some vodka in the freezer. I was expecting you. Come in.Thanks. You betcha. It looks good on you. Are you getting that black suit? Jackie? What's that fucker ever done for us? You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help? You think I'm kidding? So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting? You already knew that? He killed a guy who works for him the other day. You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em. Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell. He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you? This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever. Gimme one anyway. Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot? Great... ...Wanda! Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here. Buy ya a beer? Okay, Lou-is. You sure? Is it this aisle or the next one over? You sure? Is it this aisle, Lou-is? Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake. Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag? Fuck you. I can carry it. I'm getting out of here. What do you think? Are you sweating? That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display. Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis. All right already. ...and just take it from him. Let him and that stewardess get that money over here... Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here. I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico? Please. He went to meet that stewardess. That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went? He killed a man worked for him the other night. Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright. Is it dead? Now that's over, let's get to know each other. Wanna fuck? Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan. I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese. That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh. About five years ago. I lived there for about nine months. That's a picture of me in Japan. Did you ever go I one? C'mon, don't lie. Were you a disco guy? With Ordell? Where were you? That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then? The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco. Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos. I was pretty much the same height now as I was then. Yeah. Fourteen. Which one? No, it's what body builders drink to beef up. It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal. Want a Metrix? Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time. You okay? Yeah, there's another hit left. Really, I'm impressed. What for? Four years? How long? Where at? When did you get out of jail? Want a hit? He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am. He thinks he's Joe Gunn now. It's boring, isn't it? No problem. I was gonna tell you... Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV. Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes. 'Ola! It's Beaumont. You know it's for you.Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car... We can go anywhere. Up the stairs - down the hall. We gotta get the stuff and get out of here. You killed him. You all right? You got him. Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? Are you my man? I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of... Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny. 'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby. Set. Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night. I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay? That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here. So, should I call Andy? If you want me to go away, I'll go away. No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man. It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job... Pete... Don't... Yeah. He makes films for Mr. Eddy. He works for Mr. Eddy. No, honey... It was part of the deal. I used to. No... no. I don't know. I'm not positive... but... he knows. He'll kill us. Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes. I'll call you again. Pete? I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you. I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy. I can't see you tonight. It's me... Okay, baby. Can I call you? I want more. Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi. Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner. How would you like to take me to dinner? I was here yesterday.I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe. No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key. No. No. Fred hates them. What is? Was there? Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here? I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay... It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job... But... I thought you were getting me a drink? But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why? I don't know. Maybe a hotel. Why would anyone do something like this? On the tape! There was something else on the tape. What was that?!!! What the hell is going on?! We will. Two detectives are coming out. We've got to call the police. I guess so. Yes, I just found it on the step. That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up. Yeah? I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I? Called? When? Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one. What night? Huh?... oh, yeah, it is. It must be from a real estate agent. No, nothing. I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it. A videotape. Wake me up when you get home. I like to laugh, Fred. I thought I'd stay home and read. You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! YOU'RE SORRY!! What's the BITCH'S name?! You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? I didn't know you cared. I was? Where'd you come from? Why don't you like me? I don't know. What do you want? No... I really don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about it... It was weird... You really don't remember? You still care about me? You were acting like a different person. You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known. Last time I saw you. What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night. What's happening to you? What happened to your face? Why haven't you called me? You want some company? What are you guys doin'? Yeah. I missed you.Yeah ... ? What are you doing? Are you sure you don't? The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen. Out of focus? What the hell does that mean? What do we do? It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks. Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all. It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen. And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa. I swear to God, that was not here two days ago... Well, first of all, it's entomologist. I don't think so. I mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe. But you... Exterminator, I'd understand. But entopolgist? No way. It's hard to find. It's an old civil war cemetery. Nobody ever goes there. So... what is it you say you do? Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime... Do have any idea what I just said? With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors? Yeah, right. Even I can barely read all my work. So... how'd you hear about this? Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare. I really like that. Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples. I find you all so boring. Actually, they disgust me. But that's what I love about them. Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures? Really nice wheels, by the way. Seriously. I'm not going any further until you tell who you are. The what? Hmnn... wall, it's funny, cause usually I'm not all that attracted to stupid guys, but-- Come again? I mean, I dunno. I've seen insects with really great camoflauge ability. But never like this. Yeah. Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this. Scientific American? Really?Prude. Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper. You thought I was talking about getting married?! I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'. ...the hell are you talking about? Scott... That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it... I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level. You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it. Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they? I've been thinking. Scottie? I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie. Scottie... Scottie, Scottie... I think I'll stand out here in the sun. I don't think you're old and fat enough for me. And you think he'll... In Europe women find older men very sexy. Yeah? There is? It's very nice. How's Paco doing? Just now. It's okay. We broke up. It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are. Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning. Scottie... Yeah that's it. Mmm, needs a little something. And it's hard to get. No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese. It's already started. You got a bet on the game tonight? If you did, you never showed it. Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again. What do you want from me? Scott, You can't save everyone. You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting. About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style. Yeah. I'm sorry. Maybe you should be. A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels? Hey. Oh, I've got to get a shot of this. I'm going out with Greg tomorrow. You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else. Greg. You worship yourself. Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.Andy... You too. Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off. Well, they are French. After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor. "Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead." What? No wonder he let her go. All your weapons, on the floor! Now! Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat. I know where he'll go. We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy... We don't both have to die. You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it! Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead. Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want? You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen! No I.... Andy, you can't be sure. Andy?... What? What is it? Andy... are you okay? Holy mother of God... I hope they fucking fry us all. I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch... Are you crazy!? I didn't know he had a wine cellar. They're coming! I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it. I don't know... What makes you so sure this will work? Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry... Because, Andy. It's a cure. Andy! No! I know. He told me. Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there. Where did you go last night? What did you do? Are you okay? Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it. I'll be right back. Stay put. Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc- I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful. A la votre. So's Woody Allen. No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes. You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated. Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army! Don't you want to change? What about your glasses? Okay. But I'm back in half an hour. Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work. Fan-fucking-tastic? So... you feel okay now? You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys. What happened? Did you cut yourself? Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things... Andy! Holy shit! You must get out of here. It's not safe. Andy! What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid? I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous. Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history. Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on. It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh... Uh-huh. Good for you. You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home. You must not have known him very well. He's not like that. If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy. Salots! Shitfucker! Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit. It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle. Oh fuck, you are his nephew... You fucking liar! Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night... Andy! Andy, stop! I think he can help you -Then come find me. Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do. I have to go now, before it gets light. I'm not sure but look. . . No. I'm running to . Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend! Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money. Poor Meetoo! Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him! Not you. Him. You'll laugh. No! I look ridiculous! You must have. I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly... Who's Sophie? I'm fine. Noooo.... Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . . Well, I don't have any money . . . I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri? Don't let me go! Dmitri? I'm glad you did too. No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie! Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money! I'm so scared... Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana.... Oh! I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home. Lost. it feels lost. This was hers? It's so beautiful ... and sad. You said you wouldn't laugh! What a beautiful ship! The dessert fork! ...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . . [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE] Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie! You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess! You shouldn't have pushed us! No! HUH?! Forged papers! Now, what?! Just what do you think you're doing?! Why? I'm going to stretch my legs By pulling my hair?! Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging. Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me! I have my reasons. I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me. I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . . AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER. I'm sorry. . . I'm. . . I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ... I don't know who I am! I still don't know! And this is my future. This is who I am! I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you. "If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted! Why does everyone have to act that way? Dmitri didn't want the money? Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear... No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think... ... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything. THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ... I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me... I love you. Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met. What is it you want? What? Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. What is it, Mom? No kidding. ... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts? I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was... I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. This can't be right -- con- science. I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again? I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience? It lets a crazy man into our lives. There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact. Huh? Do you love me? Stay out of this... Doctor? No, I didn't. So why are you h... Don't be silly. How bad? Doc!!! So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll... No. Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves? His home number. Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results? Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me. No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway. No. Emergency room only. Yes. Since forever. I'm a waitress. Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better... and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and... you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold. Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he? What? Please? Now? Tell me?! No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No. You know what? I... Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well... I'm not the answer for you. Okay. See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind. Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you. Because... Is it a secret what you're doing here? I wasn't asleep!! What are you doing here? What job? Grouchy? What do you want? What do you want, Melvin? Okay. Good-bye. Go ahead. You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay? See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now. I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you. I can trust my brain. Yeah... Well... I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. You have my number. I'll take a bus. It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything. I don't. I don't want to hear that music right now. Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous! To hell with sex. I'll never forget you said it. That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?! Sex with Simon? If you ask me... I'll say, "yes." Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay. That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me? Here's the trouble with never. Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid? So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa. That's maybe the best compliment of my life. I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me. I am so afraid you're about to say something awful... Fries. And mean it... That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never. Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings. And? You wanna dance? You promised a nice place -- can't you just... You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you? Stop asking everyone. My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing. No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one? No. Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on. Hey -- you let him... Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands. I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance. Thanks, Melvin. Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage. It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit? Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you? Hi. Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night. Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask? There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes. Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going. Yes. Hello? No. Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!? Funny, I thought it was a strong point. Melvin, I'd rather not. My son. I can't. I work. The stiff one eye? No, sir... Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What? Thank you. I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler... Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever. What you did changed my life. Okay. So. Anything else? I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city. Getting loud, getting loud. A thank-you note for what you did for me. Yes. Just how grateful I am. I'm not kidding. I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever. I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up. But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because... Why did yo do this for me? That's not why I'm here... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer... The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour. Yes. Uh, Udall? No!!! Stay away from me! Sorry, honey... I'll be right there. How do you know about my mother? My son is sick, okay? What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get? Are you totally gone? This is my private home... What are you doing here? You all set here? Okay, pal... I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast. And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you? Oh, please... You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in. Sorry. You're not worried that someone might take him? So what are you doing with a dog? Spence. Spencer. An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you. He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection... Is this bothering you? What do you care? Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out." What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean? Okay. You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that? It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station. I know. He's just the best. Will you please take it? Don't want to. I love you. One night with me! But what about... We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great. All right, cut me a break. Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and... Stop staring. Do a vase. No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and... Good night. Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate. Why? What have you been thinking about? I'm sorry... are you okay? I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal. I don't think so. You need help with the pants? Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door. What a nice compliment. I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything? No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention. Yes. I really would. I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed. Water... Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room? Me. My home number is on this card. No. Actually, I think that's their technical name. It's amazing these things weren't done. They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin? Have they done skin testing for allergies? Only in the emergency room or when he was well. Have they done blood tests on him? How long has he been having problems? My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher. She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do? He's in the bathroom... He's fine. Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ... Dr. Bettes.He's not too bad. I can live with him. No, I'm fine. Maybe I ought to think about getting another job. It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh. When was the last time we laughed? Any of us? About Charles... Let's get a coffee. Nothing ever really changes, does it, David? 0 my god. At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you. Honestly David, you're so spineless. Meaning? Great. You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. Did you? Hi..... Roses. Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it? David, I'm serious! Shut up, Kevin. Honey, you-re not making sense ... Your face smells like a foot. Liar. There were three strawberries. Go ahead. I need some time, David. A little time. It's not just you. It's partly me. It isn't working any more, David. What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go. Did you really ask? Scottish. It's the last thing we need. David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'? Do we know anything about him? And what did you say? There aren't hotels? Yeeees? Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it. If you want to. Those are my breasts.

Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat? I want you to stay with me. Why are you here? Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok. I did. are you? If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold. There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. It's opening me to a death. Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again. . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you? You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease. Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease. I love you Don with all my heart. Just get outta my bed. And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then! I asked first. Do you love me? Kiss me. What if Frank came over here and found us? Beeeee careful. Does that scare you? Frank would open you. What if I told Frank that you opened me? You like to open me. don't you? I want you to hurt me. Do you want to do bad things? Anything. anything. Are you a bad boy? What do you want to do? Do you like my body? I'm not crazy. I know the difference between right and wrong. No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay. . don't hate me. Yes. Frank- It used to make me laugh .but. Come in. Please. please stay. . or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now. Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh? Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me? Don?. Are you in with them? Falling. Look. I can't. I can't. You think you know so much. Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die. Who's it, you mean. I'm alright. go hide. This won't take long. Be quiet. Oh shit. I liked being with you last night. I looked for you in my closet tonight. It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you. Yeah. hurry up though. It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now. Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I? Sometimes I think it would be fun. Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret. I want to die. Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you. Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you. You don't? Do you know? I made it go down the toilet. You can be my special friend and come and put that in me. Do you like me? You can hit me, if you want to. You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard. See my nipples? See my breasts? . See? Do you like the way I feel? Thank you. honey. Don. Hold me. I'm scared. Hold me. Please. Don? Sure I'm alright. Don't. I don't like that. What do you want? Lie down on the bed. Do you like talk like that? Do you like that? What do you want? What do you want from me? No way. NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you. How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you. Get undressed. I want to see you. How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress? THEN WHAT? That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what? The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word. Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME. An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before. Shit. You better tell me something. What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here? You tell me!! Let me see that wallet. Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont? Jeffrey. Jeffrey what? GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Yeah. Oh yeah, that's good. Oh God, that stuff stinks. Yes? What is it?You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late. Is something wrong? What's happened to your face? Of course, Jeffrey. Alright. Do you want the car? .Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so. It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him. He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you. Jeffrey, when you see your father. I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning. Jeffrey, breakfast is ready. Where's all your things, Jeffrey? Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store. I mean, for good, Jeffrey.I'll get a coat for her. Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon. Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes. Anyone else?. Alright Jeffrey, just a minute. Here you are. Would anyone like coffee? Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey. He comes over to study. It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good. Would you like a piece of cake? I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame. Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?Any special reason? Who? What happened? I love you, too. You think it's a conspiracy? You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there. Don't die on me, Jerry. Okay? Don't do this. Geronimo is down. What about you? How did you know? Where are you? You knew just what I was there for. Without a love of my own. You saw me standing alone ... Jerry...? Jerry . I'm sorry. You got to get out of here. My cell phone's on. Back in the truck. I believe you. How'd you get the picture? Why not, Jerry ? Why not? Why? What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters? Someone else might call it stalking. My dad felt it. He started carrying a gun. Back where? Love at first sight? Then tell me what happened. Jerry. Please. You don't understand. I have to know. It's all I think about. Do you have any idea what it's like not to know? Did you kill my father?! At a horse show. I don't understand. Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box? Did you kill my father? Did you kill him? You go. Send me a postcard. My father's house. John Hinkley. The guy who shot Reagan. He only had two names. What about them? What's in Connecticut? Where are we going, Jerry? Now what? We're going to Queens? What is it? No. That wouldn't be fair. Where are we going, Jerry? Thanks. I don't. I know you wouldn't. Answer me. Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it? You've been following me around. Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me? That's not love, Jerry. It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way. Can you? Now's not really the time to get into this -- Holes? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't do this to yourself. Jerry. You don't love me. If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again. Jerry, I -- I like you, Jerry. A lot. Those are song lyrics, Jerry. What? If that's what you want. Yes. Okay, I will. A water main broke. They're big details, Jerry. What was he doing down here? A billionaire waiting for the subway? Why not drown him in a bus? Why drown him at all? Why not shoot him? Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis? I mean, come on. Where then? It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool. In Newport . Murdered? Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago. And you think Group One is at war with Group Two. Cold War's over, Jerry. Elaborate on 'they,' okay? Realized what? I'll be fine. Let's worry about Henry Finch. P.O. Box in St. Louis. He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet. They're dead. Four out of five anyhow. All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke. Well, I've been tracking them down all morning. Where'd you get your subscribers? What van? Fuck you. I know you're crazy, but fuck you. You watch me, don't you? Not this again. He was murdered. Please put it down. That was him. I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now. How is it possible? It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible. It was that painting. The one on the wall. Jerry, there's something I have to ask you. Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question. To my satisfaction. Who are you, Jerry? Has this happened to you before? Was that who I thought it was? What are you doing? You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is? Holden Caulfield? Catcher in the Rye ? You're a Holden Caulfield fan. You got a list? Yeah... how many subscribers do you have? 'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.' Can you prove any of this? 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'. 'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'. Oliver Stone? Are these yours? Equitation. This would be it? Um, coffee. If that's okay? Surprise me. You okay? Believe you about what? You're certifiable. What newsletter? So why are they after you? That's it? Do they have a secret handshake? What is it with you and the space program? Nothing scary there. Sorry. You have the right to ask me certain personal questions? Till today, I haven't believed a word. Now, I'm curious. Six months, eleven days. I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me. Where to? How long have we known each other, Jerry? See? Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans? That's how a man would do it. I'm not a man. You mean I should speed up and try and lose them? As opposed to? Yeah. Them who? Right. Sit up so I can see you. Oswald was an assassin. You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry? That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out. A lot of people are after you, Jerry. Don't tell me you're naked back there. I can't promise you anything. He says a dog bit his nose. Heart attacks happen . For what? I got to get downstairs. The C.I.A., they want to see your body. You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night. Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart? People do have heart attacks. What is? I'll see you tomorrow. What? Just relax. You were there, Jerry. Figure it out. Put down the gun and I'll take your statement. Okay? You bit someone's nose off? Johnny Dancer. You've been in my office ten times. How come you never asked me about that picture before? You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry. Just call and make an appointment. No. I think you're different. I can't promise you anything. NASA is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake. Motive? Well, I -- Jerry, the point. Get there. What does it have to do with the President? Not for years. I still don't see what it has to do with the President. Testing some top secret seismic weapon. I don't see the connection. It's okay. I'm game. I don't understand. You sound so sure. Not a man. Ezekiel Walters. It was my father's. Kept it in his wallet. He was murdered -- Where'd you get it? If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live. Why are you telling me all this? I don't believe you. I'm still listening. These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry? A dog. Jerry told me he bit your nose. Missionary? Penance? You talk about it like it was a religion. If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here. Terminal? As in Catcher in the Rye ? Ask what you can do for your country. That kind of thing. It was mind control. Manchurian Candidate kind of stuff, right? Truth'll set you free. I'm listening. Fine. What the hell is going on? Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing? I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists. That's it. I went to Yale. I hope you won't hold that against me. Veritas. Truth. What is it they say about truth? A year ago I was leaving work late one night. Two guys tried to mug me. It was horrible. Jerry came out of nowhere. To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me. Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy. At first I did my beat to avoid him. But there's something inside Jerry and... Jerry made me see it. He made me see him . That make sense? Excuse me? Honestly? I think he has a crush on me. I'm sorry. What was the question again? You've asked me that one three times. You already asked me that. Why do you insist on making me repeat myself? And you feel bad for it? Excuse me? Can I ask you something? What do I look like to you? Switzerland? Too bad. Because I'm terrible at 'yes.' Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now. Working. Working. Agent Lowry? Then this is a goddamn emergency. Do you have an Agent Lowry in your New York office? I need to speak with an Agent Lowry. Go to the northeast corner. Call a cab. Bring the pizza. Then there's a poem. Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too. -- Understood. We don't know who Jonas is. We don't know who it is we're cooperating with. I don't like it. Something's wrong. This doesn't make sense. Tell him I'm on vacation. That I won't be back for two weeks. Not today... I don't think so. What do you suggest? I'm going to find him. Because he'd find me. Where do you think Jerry is? He's shown himself. Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do? And Jonas? Nothing. I was just making sure. So, who are you? Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.? I want to believe you, too. Do you believe me? Can I talk to you a second? When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know. Jonas? Agent Lowry. No. Not yet. I was just thinking that. I don't know. Didn't see him. You don't understand -- Wait -- Tell me about it.I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology. Is it possible...? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you? What would you have me say, David? Good luck, David. This... seemed best. Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the package. The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan. ... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account... You... What? I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy. David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request... It'll just take a moment. Do you have a minute -- ? David -- You mean -- What is it? What's happened? Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa. Are you threatening me? I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad. With me. What? Why? Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise. ... could it be a nested code of some sort? It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years. As for why... I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal. Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention. David -- Goddamnit, they are out there, David -- The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work? Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not. I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all. Order in the chaos. I'm practicing listening -- Meaning... You can't just pull the plug, David. It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now. Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum? We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right? So we've been trying variations of pi... No doubt. 'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...? Really? Congratulations, by the way. Oh? How's he doing? Pepsi? Tequila? Then disagree but don't stand in my way! What if you're wrong? No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks. You're -- Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there -- I'm willing to take that risk. Well -- Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky... ... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind. Because you cut it from the budget three years running. It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica... How can that be? And? What? Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles. A third layer. What... Dr. Lunacharsky...? How's the spying tonight, guys? I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always. Put it on speakers. I'm not sure. You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes? VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old. J39 Z186...? I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot. It's a civilian facility. Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin. Thank you, Mr. Sensitive. I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something... It's beautiful. This is how you see the sky? Nice. Where? Ellie. Pulsar? Dr. Cullers? Because I can't. -- but I don't believe it to be the truth. Is it possible. Yes. But -- By our standards... yes. I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right. There is no direct evidence, no. I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have. ... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design. That's terrific, but there's one problem: we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own. Pardon me, but you can't do -- ! And a hundred mile airspace. -- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode! You want to classify prime numbers? This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans. No. Please. Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference -- But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean? But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves. None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean. No! I mean... why so soon? So. What happens now? ... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it. The librarian... or the library...? Can you help us? So we passed some kind of test? The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here? So who...? And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built. And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others? Why did you contact us? Can you show me? So who -- what -- are you? But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola. So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin? You're not real. None of this is. Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...? I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again. Okay. Pensacola. Okay, okay... there. Could we hear God? Could we hear to the moon? Could we hear to China? But what do I say? I can't move any smaller. Why don't you come back with me? -- of Hadden Industries. The systems integration site. The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us. You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium? What are you talking about? It's over. It looks like pixie dust... Kent would've given anything to see this. David, too. What's that? It's so... small. Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment. And in return? A machine. But a machine that does what? Some kind of circuitry...? You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is -- A page-break signal. A period. If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you. You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden? I didn't realize I was out. What kind of deal? Why am I here, Mr. Hadden? You live here. S.R. Hadden... You compromised our security codes. You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham? I thought you were here because you want to go. I'd say this is slightly different. We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck? But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone! The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at... ... the tape... Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane? How long was I gone? Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this? Wait -- hold on a minute -- I'm -- I'm fine. Like it. Almost there. That you, Valerian? Someone tell me this is really happening. You too. Peter. You sonofabitch. I'm serious about this, Peter -- Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us. And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday? Let's get married. Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more -- But the work -- But what about your research -- ? Greenbank? We could be together again -- Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- ! The V.L.A.? It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time. If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes possible. We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now. ... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts. I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started... Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there... ... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar... God, I've missed you. '... is indistinguishable from magic.' It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist... ... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts... What a coincidence. It happens to be my fetish too. I read your paper on ETI's. It's brilliant. Sounds like a Russian general. Ellie. Arroway. He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life. ... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year. Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.' The one thing that makes it bearable is love. I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves. I don't know. If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning... In other words, God works in mysterious ways... ... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof? I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true. But -- It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real. I don't have any proof, Palmer. You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small. They don't believe me. So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites? Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you. I'm assuming you read my deposition. Hi. And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it? If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave. Now. Please. I can't hear this now -- -- I don't know -- Don't you understand? I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow -- Please -- Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now -- I can't do this -- I'm sorry -- I can't -- I'm sorry. I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow. Thank you. The final countdown. I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know? How do you mean? ... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one. How did you do it? How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves? It's late. We should go back. It's getting late... I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility. Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there. Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's? I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective. I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President. Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy. I read your book. It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose. If you came back. If you survived at all. Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't. Something like that. If you came back. In other words. It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable. I don't think so. Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems. I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors. So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this? Yes. Very much. I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine. You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure? And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it? Can you try? That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time. I flinched. And mind, yes. What are you -- That's not faith, it's physics. The second law of thermodynamics. Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small. Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations. What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all? I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe. I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side. Champagne please. And where exactly does that put your position...? For managing the truth. But the truth won't be managed, sir. It stops being the truth the moment you try. I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks. But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason -- You kill me, you really do. The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it. Y'know what? Fine. I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them. Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust -- I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.In the morning. We talked. Come in out of the rain, Bud. He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating. Come in out of the rain. In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast. You found Patchett. You found me. You're smart enough. Be a detective if that's what you want. Do you like being a cop, Bud? So you saved her. It doesn't matter. All they get is Veronica Lake. You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... Where'd this come from? I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White. If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I -- Are you asking me for a date or an appointment? No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print. He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us. He makes us quit the life at thirty. He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us. Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions? Actually, it was two. You're different, Officer White. You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute. But you did it anyway. Did they deserve it today? Do you enjoy it? There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job? You say 'fuck' a lot. I remember you from Christmas Eve. You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White? It's Lynn. He's waiting for you to mention mention. Pierce meets people. Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood. This is how they turned out. Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little. Like I said we were friendly, not friends. I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today. That's right. Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating. Yes. But do you know? No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you? Of course I am. What kind of question is that? I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean? Can I get you a drink? It's not what you think. It's practically stamped on your forehead. Merry Christmas yourself, Officer . Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona. Right now, before I back down. Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is. I know how he feels. I work for Patchett. I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who. If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake. Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside. Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself. You're tougher than Bud thinks you are. Because you'll use it against me. Won't you? No. This is the means to the reality. But I'm not going to tell you what it is. I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality. You don't like that you don't know how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. That makes him dangerous. Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier? I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money. I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. There's more if you want to hear it. I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him. You want to know what Bud's like in bed? The silver screen's loss is your gain. Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best. The way you've underestimated Bud White? It galls you that I know so much about you. You don't have information to compete. I'm curious about you. He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you. And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink? He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost. I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.Was it... a rat? I came home that night and there was blood on the floor. Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself. They were acting nervous. And that Stens kept going under the house. Don't mind the smell. I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl! No! Please leave! That's him. That's him. Maybe. I don't know. We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day. She called him by a nickname. Muns or Lunts or something. Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend. He was too old for you. You let him come into this house and be fresh to me. I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus. First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died. Let my daughter rest in peace. My daughter was a virgin! All he found were rodents. No signs of foul play. So there. A sweet man. That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss. Let my Susie rest in peace! At Christmas. We had fought. I didn't like her boyfriend. I -- she has a birthmark on her hip. It seems like my Susan, but...Damn right. I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference? No life signs at all. He's a turnip. Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off. I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together. Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro? Jon, what is it? -- Or maybe all at once. There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families. He's insisted Jamie and I be there too. What do you mean? He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff. I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ... Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...? Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago. I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead. I took it from my fake husband. How did he expect to do that? I know you -- you're the one who called. You're Castor Troy. You killed my son -- Whoever you are, don't call again. Okay, you're having an emotional crisis. You need to seek the help of a trained -- Who is this? Is someone there? You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO! You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that? What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ... And you wouldn't be. I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help. No. Totally -- you were being very, very bad. You went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn't open. Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother. We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you. ... I was dreaming ... So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ... I'm late for surgery. Jon ... we just remember how it used to be. You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop? She's only 12. Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you." Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried. Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you? Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna. I'm going to the powder room. Good. Because I'm fed up. That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off. -- Yes. Nothing. -- Studying. Yes, Jon. That Karl. Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him. I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again. The world can wait, Jon. You're going. Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go. You're wearing your suit -- ... That's great. -- what? You always say that -- then you leave. Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment? So -- how long will you be gone this time? You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law. Remember what my brother called you? I think -- you're trying to get me drunk. Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date? -- I've got to study. No. What is with you tonight? Jon -- I don't have time to play games. There're leftovers in the fridge. The hospital. As much as ever. Nothing. What happened to your big "assignment"?What's wrong with him? I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is? It's about the Director. Good to see you're feeling better. Jerome--? Not so long--just once around the sun. --when you go away. What is it? You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are? Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish? So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg-- --<i>if</i> it came to it. What happened? My medication. I left it back there. I can't. Who are they? What about the car? Why are we leaving? What <i>is</i> this place? So you didn't do it after all. Of course I think about it every day. Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties. But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67. It's here. My heart. I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into. I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun-- --on this satellite right here. I envy you, Jerome. You're angry-- You didn't know? You celebrate, Jerome? Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody. In the South Wing. They found an eyelash. Friend? I know about you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything. Why would we do that? No. Yes. I was at home. Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone? I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.Is that true? I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me. I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it? See, now this doesn't feel right. When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies-- Okay. Is this a bad time? I guess so. This is your house, right? You were the only Sullivan in the phone book. Good. Hi. I wanted to meet your brothers... See ya' Chuckie. I had fun. Oh... What class? Okay. Goodbye. I love you, Will. No take-backs. I never cared about that. You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life. I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? Yes, I do, Will. Yes, Will. I didn't even know that? What about your twelve brothers? You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you. Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid. I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. Is that what you think-- Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else-- Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of? Then what are you afraid of? Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that. Why not? "Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me. Yeah, I'm sure. I don't know. I just feel it. I know. I just do. I want you to come with me. Come with me to California. Will? Are you awake? --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can-- So, do you play the piano? I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay. Come one Will. I just want to know. Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars. Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you. Just for fun? Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry? All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory? Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially. Clearly. It's important that I learn this. No. Fine. I thought you said you'd show me your place. You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf. What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends? When? Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around? I think I can make it to South Boston. What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them? I've never seen your place. Why do we always stay here? No. I'm supposed to understand this. How the hell did you do that? If you bring the caramels. You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible. It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look: You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me. Where have you been? I want to meet them. Do you keep in touch with them? Well... Do you know all their names? Your house must have been a zoo. Bullshit. Not a chance. What, five? How many? Yeah. You have a lot of brothers and sisters? I bet you have a great family. How was that? You grew up around here? Free? Then why don't we just get it out of the way. Oh, you will? Yes you were. Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss. You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it. Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing. Have you ever seen Annie Hall? Okay... Sure. Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go. Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate. I was happy to pay. I inherited the money. I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School. I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that... Sounds good, where are you now? Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call. I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description. Yeah? See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line. What? Okay, sounds good. What? Here's my number. Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education. Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us. I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you. You suck.Other people can't. You kill people. That's because I speak human, and you speak monster. You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate. I'll hide. I'm staying here. That's probably a good idea. You never could have kept this from me. Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath! Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm.... Jesus Christ! You're a government spook? Get the fuck outta here. Is it something you've done? Not the other way around...? He was trying to kill you, right! Like love? Like heroin? No time. It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth? Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- Which would you rather...? We haven't seen each other since high school. What? I think they'll probably have booze there. ...Let me get my coat. Okay... Hold on... Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol. Flowers. That's funny. You're fucking psycho. Hello...? Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time. Are you there? I'll think about it. Unbelievable. Let me get this straight, are you asking me out? It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever. Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku. Watched television? You met people. I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences. Okay. Let's catch up. You go first. Yep. Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view... No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here? Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being? Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty? --Torn down in the name of convenience-- More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank? All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question? Okay. Professional killer. Do you get dental with that? What's your business? That's it? Tell me about yourself. Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months. Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word? I just play my own collection.Will do. I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional. I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late. You have. You haven't looked at the dossier. What's it look like? This is not good. Don't forget your identity. Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive. But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy. Enough? Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one. I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia. And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one.... Intractable, sir. You leave tonight. They were very upset. In Detroit. This weekend. They blame you for the compromise. They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep. They're not happy, sir. That's going to cost. All of it? It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip? This? Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange? Take care of her. She's a keeper. Of course you will. Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back. We had a good laugh, didn't we? You don't have a headache. I have a headache. I have a headache. You have a headache? Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache. Nature made him then broke the mold. I spoke to your father the other day. His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass! Marlin Perkins and Jim! What's a revival tent? I bought a new rug.Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was -- Ben, I don't think he wants us here. The phone's out. We'll talk in the morning. You'll get some sleep on the couch out there? Ben. Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here? We're not going anywhere. Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you. Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession. You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch -- You're not going to -- Damn it, Ben -- Well? That this was going to be a key party? This just isn't the best moment for this. In the car. Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it? Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like. If you're going to insult me -- It's a starting place. Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it. I'm not surprised. Don't be dim. It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup. I have no idea. Don't start. See for yourself. That one. Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash. So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway? Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that. Dinner in ten minutes. The turkey in? Leave it -- I'll wash it for you. That shirt? I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children. No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben. What is going to happen with us? Have you -- I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know... Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to-- I... I think I am... Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches. Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce? Hmm. Good night. So early? What do you think? The Halfords have invited us again this year. Good night. -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision -- It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you. So maybe you'll come too? I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok? I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens. You're staring at me. Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit -- No thank you. We should be off. I suppose we'll make an appearance. Thank you Janey. A key party? Sure. Maybe coffee. Yeah. You? Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait? Well, we can talk about it. Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city. Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right-- Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't -- My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all. Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen -- You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk. Let me. It'll warm you up. Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning. What sort of problems are you planning exactly? I suppose. Why? We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11. Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner. I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore. Oh Wendy. We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston. The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos. Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows. Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it. Mikey Williams? Who? I saw you on your bike today. Hi Wendy. Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother-- I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown -- How'd you know? I'm thinking of going back to school. I used to know how to cook. Thanks again. For the dinner. Of course. Oh. It's not a bother. I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile. You're here... I'm a bit surprised. Reverend Edwards. I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about. Take care. And you're still trying to get me into bed. But not too ashamed. I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude. I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed. That's right. All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in? You're saying that Christ is the child, and -- Forget what? My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. When was the last time you rode a bike? I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person -- Yes, it was -- I ended up -- Yes.He's probably been waiting all night at the station. Yeah. Huh? Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff. Talking to me, dad? What do you think we're doing, dad? ... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and -- Nothing. Nah. Good-night dad. Fascist! Dad stop it! I don't like coffee. Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know. Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt. Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party? I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in. They need the money for my band uniform at school. Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me -- I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and -- You're not a psycho! Mom. Are you ok? We were just riding around. Nobody. With Mikey? Hi mom. Yeah. Maybe. Can't really tell yet. Yeah. Yours? Huh? Wow! I don't know. I don't know. Maybe we can just watch some TV. You have to follow me? Then why'd you come after me? Did you tell Sandy? Sure. Twinkie? I have plans. Right. And? Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you? Is this Charles? Hood residence. Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets? With who? Can I come? Why don't you use the phone downstairs? Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth. Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much. Greetings, Charles. Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot. I have not touched your sh-- Stuff. You watching this? Charles. I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down. That's nice. Are you drunk? That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream. Have you ever had a nocturnal emission? One more shot? You never tasted the stuff? Want a drink? Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff. They left it in the jungle. Well. It looks like someone got to his private parts before us. He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted. He's dead. No. Yeah. Just thought I'd stop by. Sandy, you scared the shit out of me. I have to go to the bathroom. The ones you built? Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d. Yeah? See ya. Hey Sandy.Dad! I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?! What are you guys gonna do? On the side of that one truck. "InGen." What's InGen? Because you said so. Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did. You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you? I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you. I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin. I could come with you. No. Richard talked to his parents. That was about a year ago. Which one? No, Dad. I have thoughts of my own once in a while. I'm your daughter all the time, you know. Not just when it's convenient. My vacation is over in a week. Stop saying fantastic. Where are you going? I don't even know this woman. Hi, Dad.We've got to see one to find out. Is there any -- Why wouldn't they? Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds -- And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible. Ian, you're not insane! I'm so glad! Not without a shot of the nest. That was a pair bond! A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound! You're going too? What? Oh, God. Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals! These formations. They're dried -- Ian. It's guano. Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals. The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square. You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax. Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy. What?! They will come after me. But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back. I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes! There we are -- your baby is free -- Born free, as free as the wind blows. As free as the grass grows -- That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here! It has to be temporary, something that'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows... Funded by whom? Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal. What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity? Where do you think she gets it? No more smoking. We leave no scent of any kind. No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags. We will observe and document, but we will not interact. Where's Ian? WHAT ARE YOU- No. Hold it down, Nick! We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest! I'm almost done. Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can -- That little black line means death for this infant. The fibula won't heal straight, so the ankle joint can't pivot when he stands on his hind feet. The baby won't be able to run, and probably can't even walk. It'll be crippled, and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old. Ian, nothing we observe will be valid if we're trailing along in the wake of an army. Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day. That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated. You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead. Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic. That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it- -- way we could safely -- I believe in him. Ian's a very good friend of mine. You think this is all a joke? Very noble of you. You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you? That must be interesting. What drew you there? So what's your story, Nick? You've got to be kidding. Ask her. We have to send someone to look for him! Move where? Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send -- Hey, we came here to observe, you came here to strip-mine the place! It's a looter mentality, all you care about is what you can take.We do not know. Yes, yes. Your brothers are here. Two. I will be back in a few days. I miss him too. You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered. At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink. Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come." He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die. Your father had been very sick. Oh, no. Where will he go? Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen. Please, come in, so cold. Good day. You decide. I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming. Me? I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us. Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen. I have news. The Regent has resigned his post.I see that. Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart. Too young? The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad. I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.And that day, your father got better. He named you Lhamo. "The Protector." You were a beautiful baby. So calm. Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died. Again?Did you hear me? Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!! Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you? What's your name? We're no leaving you! Which way? What? Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV! But the power... Scent glands. Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other. We'll find him. We'll be back and find him. Manny... This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud? Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code... No... Just inner chambers... No... Peter... Ah... Your arm, you can't... Oh, come on, come on! That's it. That's it. Breathe easy. Don't touch it. And for Godsakes, try not to sweat. They can sense chemical changes... The scent won't last... Peter- Just do it!! Rub it on the windows! They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired! His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor! That's camouflage... No, Jesus, no. Don't. It's me. Can you hear me? It didn't bite me. Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you... ...you don't even know what you're looking for. Ironic, don't you think? These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are... I was just late. Right. I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids. No such thing, baby. He was just doing his job. I heard how you talked to him. No, there's... Metaxonycha Godmani. Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it? Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop... Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen. Don't you get it? It's more than that. This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts! I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel. I'll be late. You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that. Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they? We're down to a "couple" now, huh? We did no impact evaluation. The consequences of... You know what I mean... Do you think we did the right thing? Please. An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside. You sure you didn't see one of these? You guys have done a nice job. How bout five dollars? Hello. I know. Help me get a sample. My God. And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult. This wing configuration. I've never... It bit you. I have no idea. Are you ready? I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay? What's this? Oh, Jesus. What? Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here. ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that. Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower. Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...And that is my last word on the matter. Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock. It is quite late enough. It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged. I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box! ... Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave. Cold is good-- Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?! No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors? Gesture? Yes. Yes it was. You should never have gone out in such foul weather. Then why send me back to them?! I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it! You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most! -- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me! I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time -- Duty?! You talk about duty?! The Queen forbids it. I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please. I do not accept. Yes? Has someone seen to those bruises? I was told you were in a fight. John? The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure. Am I not safe enough with you, John? Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. Must they always follow us? What is it, John? John? To keep out the cold. I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John. What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do. I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good. His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject. He has been attending at Balmoral for many years. Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming. I am told so. I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals." Craobhan-geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?! Those, over there, there. What are those? Yes. It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not? Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish it. The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- He thought so, yes. Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. Then why do you persist in doing it? You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so. Mr Brown. Yes. That will be company for you. Yes. You have a brother in service here, do you not? I forget his name. My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much. Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated. And the pony? You are well? You are here safely. Mr Brown. I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral. This is my good John Brown. I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime? I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief. Is that not enough? Then they may read about me. But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli. How ill is he? Why was I not informed? No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son. I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy.... Why am I being lectured in this way?! Cold is good! Whom? Why was I not told earlier? How long has he been this sick? Has he been hurt? Unwell? Why? Well? I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there? What is he doing there? Just them? Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear? What do they want? My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person. From whom? What is it? Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too. No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely! Why not? Who told them that? Read it! Read it. And now I am back. We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It was most agreeable. No. I shall be out walking. Why? Please make sure it does not happen again. Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding. What is the matter with him? Then why are you not with him? Why is he not here? Where is my son? That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well. But you are not eating enough. One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.I'll think about it. I'm okay. I did what I came to do. Hey, handsome. Brevity this... And what will he do? Needing. I'm moving this book to Viking. I'm taking my next book to Viking. You're going to say it, aren't you? Major. Dish. It's too late to start over. How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor? I can't even say it. DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION! That was Thursday. Try less appropriate. I wish. I KNOW THAT! I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF! Let's not get carried away. Beyond reason. The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts! I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus! I don't know the meaning of the word guilt! He was in love with me every day for nine years. I can make him happier than she can. Sure. This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless. ... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times. There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years... Because I realized. When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart. And it will be there every... I was devastated. If I didn't have to hate her, I'd adore her. What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit. You're butting in. You flew all the way h... Chill? Since when do you say ch... She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois! He's adored me for nine goddamn years. It's called the Law of Love, asshole. Same difference. If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves. You have no appropriate sense of emergency. My best friend is ruining his life. I'll have to kill myself before I call him. We'll never be the same. He can't do that to me! He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th... You think... He says, "Swear. When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!" He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me... Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane... He's the salt of the earth. Kind and loyal and generous. The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there. No, he's nothing like me. He's like you. Only straight. Nine years, we've seen each other through everything. Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times. The best times of my life, maybe. Just drinking and talking. Even over a phone. No, no, the opposite. That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk. Sometimes I do. Like for two months. Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w... Plus some guys whose food I don't like. See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in. It's who I leave out. Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity? If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note. I never want to go through this again. Have you ever heard of. Irony? In one minute. You are going to feel so foolish. Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat... If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form. When are you gonna come clean with your folks? What with the psychosis and all, yeah. Who? The jerk who's running your life? They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk? Uh, Kimmy...? Your call.

Jesus, we're trapped! I've missed a step. I was gonna predict that. No. Well, perfection can get wearing after whi... Do you get hysterical in small confined spa... Let me rephrase that... Do you get nervous in small confined spaces? It's been awhile. I'll take your word. A trademark move, don't touch it. How about... Well. You've been introduced to the symphonic range of... ... garden sports, all. Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit... So your honeymoon is exactly where? ... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding. Just to top it off. ... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s... Don't you have to be somewh... That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit. Right from the start. What else did he tell you... I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress. Which was the disqualifying factor? Uh. How about promoting a bridesmaid? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes. ... you want a menage on your wedding night. Can you watch the road? Excuse me? You need a few dollars. Well, we're... You are <u<so right. What a nerve on that guy! Bring my dress to church, huh? Ex-cuse me? It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you? I saw the show. Right. And then it didn't want to come off. Exactly. Well. See. That was a... reflex to see if it would... ... unless he has a hump. I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office? Nobody has. So far. I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring. I'll collect the inconsequentials. Then it could all come out, sooner or later. Nobody should be in on this. Just you and me. Or, more correctly, I. He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating. He's said some things over the past few weeks. Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job. I think he's been fired. It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss. Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right? Is anybody watching? I think you're making a mistake, sir. Nice meeting you, too, Walt. I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question. ... me, yeah. And she likes Tommy Lasorda. Case closed. Okay, we'll split up. You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who... That's little egotistical. Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock. You've got a lot of explaining to... You can't believe you've lost her! Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love... That is so romantic. It's two weeks. Why would she come here... I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before... Lower. Actually. Lower. I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum. Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung... I didn't know it would get sent. I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and... ... wrote it, yeah. I'm the bad guy. DON'T SPEAK! This is the dumbest thing I will ever do. So dumb, in fact, that I can't. I don't think. Shhh. The Big Hurt, huh? You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. As they say in the sport biz. ... your one chance for true happiness? Well, it happens. Oh, yeah. Does that make it right... She admits it's her fault. BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. And your point? Get married, apparently. But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch! I had the craziest dream last night? Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to... If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento... Should we take a walk? Or maybe some food sent up, or something... Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif... Michael... A bad combination. What happened? "Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl." "Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..." Michael? What ha... ... maybe it's congratulations. It means a lot. You're right. Easy come, easy go. We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou... It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves. That's my point!! I'm up against a deadline. ISN'T THERE A GUARD? A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR! SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH... Yes. No accents today. Well. We danced to it. Just like this. The night we met. I'll check. I have it on powerbook, these days. I wouldn't know. I never had that many first thoughts. Me either. Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year. You've been the man in mine. Well. There's a lot of memories to choose from... Have you. If you like. You miss her, huh? Well, you've got the rest of your lives. You keep saying that. Like I said, dazzling. Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun... Michael!! Never can tell. You need a baby-sitter. That's what I'm here for. Boy, those were the days.

Such as. I just admire your maturity, that's all. I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring. Day after day, year after year... Best everything, Joe.

Don't you see... This must be... very, very, hard on him. Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared... We settled this. And I reneged. That wasn't fair.

After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life. But he sure can kiss. He sucks soup through his front teeth. ... cigars in bed? I broke him on that. But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times... ... his snoring, yeah. He says it's worse than ever. That snaffle one...? It depends. If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix. Or depending on Indiana- Clevel... I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye... What? Because I'm a little understand... ... just my bridal shower. And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game. He said that, too. ... you hate weddings, you never go. Not you. You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive. The twin part. I like to remain impartial in my contempt. The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts. With amazing bodies! You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp. This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav... See. Dry. It's in the delivery. But I can't be dry. I can be quick. I can even be funny. My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor... I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you. All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that... MICHAEL!! Well, if that's the way you f... What is that sup... All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life... And to m... It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him... He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust... ... and public relations is a big problem area for him. No, it's, uh... a real big favor. To the twins' soiree? So they can paw you and drool...? The most important thing. Is being together. Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...Enter Cotton Weary. Finish what my son started. Where do you think he got it? Mental illness is heriditary. Who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? He was a smart kid but children need parental guidance. I couldn�t believe you didn�t recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book. Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home. Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think? And are the police sure about that? Where is Sidney's father? Hi, Gale, any leads? I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year. And much richer as a result. What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting? Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?Don't do anything stupid, Cotton. You've come to far. Cotton, I've done nothing but help you. You have a right to be angry. Did you do it? But you�ll never get away with it. What are you going to do? Jesus, you�re just as whacked as your son. You�re all in this together? Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me. No, I don't. Why don't you ask them? Home--where he lives. Tons and tons. Good for you. Do I know you? You look familiar. Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter. Fair enough. Look, I'm sorry about the face. Dewey? Let's go. Jesus Christ! Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere. This is all too familiar. Ssshh! What was that? Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum. And Joel's pre-med. ..and as lonely as I am... Dewey, you and I would never make it. Can we turn the light on? What are we looking for? Billy had alibis too. He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek? If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could? Not good. How you doin? Yeah? And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit. Mood swing. I'm manic depressive. I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say except I'm sorry. I never meant to imply... You have every right to be upset. Oh Dewey, I'm sorry. And an explanation is, of course, out of the question. I see you read the book. I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned... Hello, Dwight. No, wait... You're getting obvious. What do you mean? What do you want from me? Oh--a God complex Where are you? What do you want? I don't play games. Who are you? Who is this? What? Sid, I'll come with you. It's good to see you involved. It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper? I'm sorry. Sidney. Hello. How are you? The safety what? Fuck that! I don�t know. Yes, goddammit! Someone�s trying to kill me. I need the police....campus security...send someone...check out...place... Hang up...call... Don't do that. Hang up...call... That's smart. I can't believe you're alone in that house. Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah... Where? What is it? It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing. Don't. Think Bailey. That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there. thought he was doing AA.Tuition�s expensive. Tails. Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to flip. We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings. So we found a compromise. ..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience... A twist ending if you will. And now, drum roll please... A verdict and premiere all on the same day. I love it. Of course not. Who wants to? What�s the point if we don�t get caught? Where�s the glamour in that? You�re the one who got away. We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you. He sent me the cutest e-mail. He hates Oliver Stone. Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on. Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive. I got it.. He seemed harmless. Randy somebody. She's got guards with her. I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together. Damned if I know. She ditched me. So you'll relieve me at 2:30... You're going to get it. You know what happens. Don't do this. What? He tried to kill her first. Too bad. Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening. I have rehearsal. I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20. Oh, Sid, you�re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious. I'm the only one who can cut him down. Can I come with her? It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to. No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed. We're missing the Sig Ep party. No, girletta, I don't leave your side. Who is that guy? That was good. I'll cover you through rehearsal. Derek when do you get outta docu- drama? What about rehearsal? Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas? Time to change numbers again? Knock yourself out.It�s over, Cotton. Please, Cotton, don�t do this. What? Did it? Cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when I'm not reminded of what I've done. I have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what I feel in every vein of my being. And I wish I had in me what you need to hear but I don't think the words exist. How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that? I did that. What do you want from me, Cotton? I don't think that's a good idea. Cotton. But nobody wants to see that. It�ll never go. They�ll rewrite you. You don�t want that. You�re not going to get away with this. Why? No. This is a set up. It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men. No, it's not. What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it? My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends. This is exactly what I don't want. I'll get my jacket. The forbidden subject. Where have you been'? You missed my shining moment. I won the macaroni sundae binge. It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper. Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo. I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks. Whatever. Dewey, there's no such place. No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence. Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat... You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here. No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it. Yeah, right. It's a copycat killer I knew this would happen. That fucking movie. Oh my God. How could it happen? Three hundred people watched? Nobody did anything? Oh my God. But who would operate your camera? My morn was a Delta. It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas. Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews. I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't stop calling but other than that... You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos.. It's not a good idea, Hallie. No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright. I'd really just like to be alone. No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me. I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please. It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside. Yeah, right. Gotta. Please, I have the perfect excuse. Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes. Hello? Hello? But... Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way. Thanks, Joel. You're not allowed to ask that. This has nothing to do with me, Joel. There's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the US at any given time. I can't control that. Who's hungry? Don't panic. I'll be right back. He's after me. Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here. Thanks for the movie, Randy. I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve. I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive. Me, too. Randy. Me too. Do you work for her now? What do you want?What is it?! Right now it's about 8 o'clock at home. People are going to work, kids are going to school... In that case, I accept. I would, but no one can perform the ceremony. I guess it doesn't matter. Marry you? Except write our wills. I never thought this would happen. No premonitions, nothing. So close... We don't have time. I'll explain later, hurry! We have room! Let's go! Sooner than later. Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again? So what's going to happen to you? I'll do my best. How does the distress signal look? I'm about to blow the wall. Barnes? Taylor! Where are you? You too. But you can't be sure! It's suicide. You have to come with us! But how are you going to escape? And what are you going to do?! What? What are you talking about? Why? Where are you going? A flare? A flare won't do it. We don't have enough suits to get the others out. What's that? Oh my God. What happened? I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude. You saved my life. Helllp! Words to live by. Sure. Yeah, but you didn't answer my question. What do you think's going to happen to us? Taylor? Explosive? Don't worry about me. Where are we going? At this point I'm ready for anything. Yeah. We did it. Ready as I'll ever be. I understand. Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking. Wait. Even if we do, it might be too late. It must be oxygenated if we can hear him. He certainly is polite. We could send Mac. If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other. Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath? Why can't we? Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes. OK...it's open. Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition? Supposing we could get out of this room? Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge? Just considering our options... sir. Well maybe we can do something like that. Given a malfunction, how would a rescue team get you out if the doors won't open? Well maybe there's a way out of here. What are we going to do? Still, I hope I behave on the moon. I'll stick close to you. Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction. Well I hope I don't do anything careless. Like open an airlock by mistake? So you were looking for a new challenge. Yes. Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you? That's right. Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it. It will reduce the level of negative feedback. So I've been told. No, just enjoying the view. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm going back for Taylor! Carlo! He's up on the bridge! He's going to be OK. Now who's missing? There's no time to explain. Get everyone together! We found a way to the pods!Zander, no...! Zander, what are you doing ? Is it true ? I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ? I don't know, Zander. Yeah. A funeral. No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool. Please, I... Everybody's lost someone by now. This shouldn't be any different... Excuse me...! No, funny there's almost no wounded at all. Funny... So who's got time to get married ? There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too... You weren't thinking...you were dreaming ! Zander, please... Let's go ! Johnny, wait... Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now. It looks like an... asteroid. WHERE IS IT ? I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet... You and me, huh ? Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ? Don't change the subject. Am I right ? Hey, check it. No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way. Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always seems to last forever. Oh, I see... teamwork. Or...? Oh, yes, sir. Vector ? In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up. It's amazing, us running into each other like this. Maybe it's fate. Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ? Hey ! What are you doing here ? Johnny, this is Zander. Don't you have to finish the game ? Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ? Are you alright ? Which way ? AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ! Take care, wilya Johnny ? Well, look at this. The three of us back together again. Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K. You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it. I thought you were KIA, Johnny... No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here. ...I'm sorry. Johnny...! I thought you were dead ! What's wrong with you ? Johnny... Life is so different from the way it was. One day you'll see what I did was best for both of us. You don't look very happy to see me. It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying. What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ? I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will. I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write ! Alright, I love you. I'll miss you, too, Johnny. You talk to Carl ? Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad. My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go. Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what. Games & Theory ? That's Military Intelligence... Oh, Carl ! Hey, Carl, what's wrong ? Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse. I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...? Shhh... You're right. Let's never stop... Everyone's looking... we shouldn't... Are you the boy for me ? He's nothing like you. Johnny Rico, you're jealous ! Zander is going for pilot, too. No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance. He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ? Good luck at the academy. I'll meet you outside. Romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation... How do I know if this is love ? Sometimes I do what I want, eh ? It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran. Johnny, my Dad's home today. I thought you were going to help Carl. You can't walk me home. How come that's all you talk about anymore ? I don't want everyone to see. Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers. Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing. Excuse me...! Eeuch ! Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical She's flying starships ! Your turn... No way, ma'am ! This is Rodger Young, we're going down... Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we're going down...! Where's Lieutenant Barcalow ? Plasma, ma'am... from the planet. Thank you, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am ! Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.It's alright 'cause I got to have you, Johnny... I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ? Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group... What frequency ? I'm on it ! Planet P ? What kind of name is that ? What ? Well, excuse me, sir... You used to dance... C'mon... Way to go, amigo ! That you don't have what it takes to be acitizen ! You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny. If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo. It stinks, you goin. You got it. High school... remember ? Run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score... Flip six, three hole. What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ? What's your malfunction, Rico ? Hey, amigo, come chow with me. Guess you gotta go. Sure. How come we never got together ? Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start. Too bad for her if she's not around. Hey, Rico, wanna dance ? You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ? Hut... hut !This time of the year...? Oh, my, what's that ? We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite. Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ? Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach ! Good good, then it's all settled. Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do... Well, of course you should come home immedietly ! Bill... pick up... it's Johnny ! You little rat. You haven't called, you haven't written. It's been so lonely here without you... Hello... Oh, Johnny...! I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform. Johnny, please. Calm yourself. Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ? Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother. He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened. Yes. Abbot understands these things. Anything you didn't understand? You heard what Abbott said? Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling? What other people? And Billy told you that he'll tell that to... You've talked to Billy? Billy said that? He knows that? Billy? Because I'd be to blame, right? I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then? I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens. The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child...the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams. What do you mean? That's right. What do you mean? A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six. With our hands. Yes. The old-fashioned way. Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring. Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children. That's the way I thought of them sometimes. No. I saw it on his face. No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia. From what? Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him. Those are all from the fair last year. Abbott and me were judges at the pet show. Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott. No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers. I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing... About the Ottos? Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'. The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies. Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here. I'll just strap it on the roof. I didn't say that. Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting. Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.Goodnight, Mr. Ansel. Oh. Right. What do you mean 'outgrown it'? No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her. I don't know. It just seems...kind of weird. Are you sure? Okay. Was it good? Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason... It's the truth. No. What's this lawyer business? Who's Mr. Stephens? From you? Is this mine? I feel like a princess. It's interesting. How was it? And winter? What happened to summer? He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein. It wasn't. I feel like his monster. Should I keep reading? No. Not mean. Just...very angry. Yes. Because...he wanted to them to be punished. That's right. What, Mason? Okay. Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad? Yes. Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats... It's like a song. The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty... It was snowing. Why? Dolores. You seem very sure about that. The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame. I won't lie. What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens? Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and... You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. Then you start to feel...unlucky. I don't like thinking about the accident. I don't even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and... I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital. Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it. No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed. I was scared. And there wasn't time. No. Yes. I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was. Positive. Seventy-two miles an hour. Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared. The speedometer. And it was downhill there. Dolores was driving too fast. Yes, I understand. I was scared. Before the actual accident? Yes. There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly. Yes. As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it. Yes. No. Until the accident? No. Yes, there was. My usual place. On the right side. The first seat. Yes. Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot. No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day. About eight-thirty in the morning. Yes. Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new. She'll move away. Will the police do anything to her? What's going to happen to Dolores? How about Sunday night? That's always the best time. Great. He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely. I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now? Great. No. As opposed to this T.V.? Nothing. How will he do that? What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things? But you didn't lose me. My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer? You and Mom have a lawyer? That's too high. I'll never reach it. The door needs a lock. It's okay. Very slick. The ramp? They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident. Mrs. Ansel's clothing. Nothing. Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life. You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure. You mean it? Really?Why did you do that, Billy? Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed? Because I have to. I have to. ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough. Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus... Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was. Good night, Billy. You're leaving. Just like we look forward to this. They can look forward to that. Your kids never cry. Yes. Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me. When the game's over, I guess. No. It should be dry by now. Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking. Have you been waiting long? Can't you make it later? Billy, that's too early. No. Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall. Crafts. They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago. Yes. Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian. There's the Prescots... What do you mean? ...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and... At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle... She...she was a friend of mine. Will you be spending more than a night? You don't know that. The Ottos. But Charlene... Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week. I apologized, I offered to help. Then, you kiss his ass. Always. No. Yes. Julliard, yeah. One brother, one sister. Originally, Connecticut. Like what... my favorite color... ? Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was. There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk-on this time though. Bit-part. I have to get to the airport... Claire. That's my fault. I get too worked up at these. I'm very method. You do know... that's not my name. I have to show you... Please, Nicholas, let me show you... Open that door, you'll see. Your brother's there... Conrad. He's there. It's your birthday party... It is. It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money. Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration... Think about it! They followed you every step of the way. There was always a safety net. The taxi, there was a diver. At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks... You're wrong. You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down. Let me show you... Nicholas... Okay... okay... I put it down. Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door. He's an actor... What did you really see ? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies. Please, you've got to believe me... He's got a gun, with real bullets! No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ? Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game. This was all the game. Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game... He's got a gun. Everyone, he's got a real gun up here! Real situation! ... damn it... Just... wait. Just wait! Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore... We searched the house. Where'd you get that gun? That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic... Where'd you get that... ? They won't... It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank. It wasn't you. It wasn't personal... How deluded can you be? There's no why ... What do you think you're doing? Nicholas... Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone... What are you doing here? It's out of your hands. Mm... I wouldn't worry about it. Who is it? Who is it? I don't know. A lot. What? All I mean is... someone like you... It's just money. You should be glad you're alive. My name's not Christine. It's not my real... What did you say? They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough. Why else would they be willing to put you under... ? They did the same to him as they did to you. It wasn't his fault. He thought it was his only way back. They fleeced him real good. Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday. Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember? I was already playing my part, before you started the game. I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning. I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee. No cops. I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud. They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else. You don't have a choice. No one else is going to tell you what's going on. I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead... What are you doing... ? God, wake up, it's a con! Nicholas... Not here! They can see. They're watching. I don't... What's wrong? Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel? Want anything to drink? Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay? Be right back. Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in... Okay. I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me? Where'd you get this? What is it? Didn't think I'd ever see you again. It's okay, dad. What are you doing here? They said five hundred. I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit. I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit? I have a confession to make. Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke. Give me an address so I can send your shirt back. Right. Call me Christy. I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name. Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted. If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed. Nice. What exactly do you do? Where are we going? We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall. That's classic. Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar? Never did catch your name. ... two hundred dollars a toe. Your shoes cost a thousand dollars? Me? You're the one who... ! Shit! You're a grown man. I'm not responsible for you. They'll love that. What's C.R.S.? I'll wait. My hero. Let's go. I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied. No. You pull me up. You first. Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us? If there was one. Why not? Never mind. How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience. Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for? Home. See you around. There's got to be a flashlight. You should be. You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ? What are you talking about? A game? What... is... happening... ? Let's talk to whoever can get this over with... What is your problem? He's turning blue! He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911! Don't just stand there, get help! Do you know what to do? What's with him? Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye. What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment. What are you babbling about, psycho? Oh, no... you. I said I was sorry... It was an accident. I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day... I'm so sorry.Isn't this what you like? They told me you had a thing for boats. Don't be nervous. They said you'd be nervous. I've been so lonely. They were my husband's. My late husband... may he rest in peace. Let's get you dried off first. I might have some clothes below.Goodnight. See you home. Nobody worried about your father. You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you. Not much, I think. No. What happened... no one expected it. Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time. All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him. What makes you ask? I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened? Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong? Mr. Van Orton... ? Goodnight then. I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else? Is everything alright? Well... send my love, if you see him again. You did? How is he? Dinner's in the oven. Have a nice day.Dr. Frock? We will. No, Dr. Frock. You can't. That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes. None of that matters now. The people upstairs need us. We have to help. What's that? Dr. Frock. Did you hear that? I think so. What's going on? And it's hungry. It's been two days since it's eaten. There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! All those people in one enclosed space... With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear. "Nocturnal. External hair and bony plates. Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers. Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust. Aggressiveness: extreme." All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw. "Species unidentified. Genus: unidentified. Phylum unknown. Male, weight in excess of 240 kg. Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal." But a virus normally codes for other viruses. This one's making human and animal proteins. Listen to this. "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone. 4- monoxytocin supressin hormone." Look at this. An ambyloid reovirus protein. That explains why the computer's confused. The plant's infected with a virus. Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go? Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock. What are they? Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui. John used it as packing material. What is it? A blow dart. Seed pods. A plant press. Pretty unimpressive stuff. That Cuthbert. What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit. You are this museum. It won't be the same without you. I'm not giving up. Your work is highly relevant. What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology? Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit. My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you. How can you say that? You know it's not true. Let me help. I can take care of everything. We can't do without you. You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology. You're practically an institution around here. I don't believe it. Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class. Evolutionary Biologist. I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years. I'm an Evolutionary Biologist. What do you do? Yes, I do. Okay. How about lunch? Yes, he's fine. Greg... take care of yourself! Yes. Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant. When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach. The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing. Pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains! This is it. This is what he, or it... is after! The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain! Try Weinstein's tropic hormone. What kind of hormones? It's reptilian. There's another possibility. A lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage. Turkish Gecko, I believe. A lizard. It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian. Mbwun. For once I'm glad you're rumor central. What in the world is going on? That's impossible. What? I have the species identification on these teeth. We can extract DNA and start running tests on the extrapolator program. Call Dr. Frock. He wanted a demonstration. But at what a price. I'm so glad to see you. What's the occasion? I can't! Do it, quickly. Please. Aim for the eye. Just like John. He won't listen. You have to! Listen! All viruses pass on their own DNA. Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses! This one was different. It inserted a whole array of genes into John. Reptile genes, sixty five million years old. Those genes remade him! It's not his fault! That thing is John Whittlesley. I should have seen it before! The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA! He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states. He probably entered the country as a man. It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum! No! Don't kill him! Pendergast, you were right. It's John! Listen to me, Pendergast. Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien. In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain! If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it. Shoot it in the eye! You smell that? Help someone! That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing. The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest! The answer's right in front of us. We have to try and draw it off! I think... for the pleasure of the kill. No. It's still hunting, but not for the hormones. I think... it means it's full. Its eyesight is worse than I thought. It couldn't see us. And it couldn't smell us through the glass. What is it doing? What are you going to do? Is there another way around? The planetarium! Unlock one of the other storage rooms. We're going upstairs. We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here. We have the fibers. Don't you see? The creature is hungry. It wants the hormones in these plants. It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers. We're just a poor substitute. To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants. It's not supernatural. Mbwun is an animal. Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam. That would fit. It's nocturnal. Quick. Come inside. Wounded? You're not. Where is it? Pendergast? Are you all right? When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair. Viruses can damage DNA. So can radiation, certain chemicals. Even cancer. Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out. I have to get started. This will take several hours. I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw. All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something. I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there? That's not what I saw. Behind me. Over there. It's okay, I'm all right. I remember now... It was an animal. Something large! I could smell it. It was hunting me. I saw two green eyes in the dark. You were behind me? Running after me? I don't know. I'm not sure. We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one. I don't know. He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation. But I've never seen it. It's in the exhibit. My God. Then it was an animal. I don't understand. No. I'm all right. I won't let this affect me anymore. John wouldn't get help. His ego endangered the lives of others. His theory came first. No one knows. The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals. Yes. He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection. The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species". It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years. A legendary monster called Mbwun. He was afraid of himself. He tried suicide once. He was ill. Manic depressive. He had wild emotional highs and lows. Not a happy affliction for a scientist. He'd been revered in our community. By the end he was a joke. That was two years ago. John was still in love with me. He wouldn't leave me alone. How did you know that? Yes. Once. We met at Columbia. John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there. John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that. He was a fine man despite his problems -- I don't understand. And John? If he were alive he'd have contacted me. Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John. Is he really dead? With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was... You aren't here for a lesson in DNA. An invention of mine. It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA. I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.And to you, Mr. Andrews. Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? Bottom, left, right. I have it. No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer. Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?! Yes, I understand. Thank you. You're certain? I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. Is this in any way unclear? Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. I'd rather be his whore than your wife. Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. But I was with him the whole time. Something serious has happened. I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee -- I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. I was tired. The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming. My God... Cal. Is it a -- Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself. It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. Cal, stop! It was an accident. You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso. I felt like black. You told me to change. I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. I promise. I can't feel my body. I'm so cold. It's getting quiet. It's so cold. You jump, I jump, right? I'm not going without you. Will this work? I'll be right back. I didn't. I just realized I already knew. I know, I know. He couldn't have. Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you -- Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? We have to tell Mother and Cal. Could it have damaged the ship? I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. You're trembling. Au contraire, mon cher. To the stars. He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere. Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? Fabrizio said you might be up -- I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. It's not up to you to save me, Jack. You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. Jack, I -- I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star. A mistake? I don't know the steps. May I cut in, miss? Jack, must you go? Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson. I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair. You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it. A whole ten cents?! So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! And...? You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. I think you must have had a love affair with her... You liked this woman. You used her several times. And these were drawn from life? Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. May I? What's this? Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. If only it were that simple. Yes, exactly! Worse I'm afraid. Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. Oh God, I am such an utter fool. I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. Mr. Dawson, I -- Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. Could I speak to you in private? HELP! HELP!! Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. You're crazy. I know what ice fishing is! No. How cold? The fall alone would kill you. Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. You're distracting me. Go away. What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. Don't come any closer. I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. It's been 84 years... Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once. I should like to see my drawing. There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie. Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. Goodbye, mother. It's so unfair. How can you put this on my shoulders? Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. Excuse me.Jake ... And I love you too. Why's that? Can you make it back up? Bobby? Are you all right? Hope is a four-letter word. My mother died in this canyon. I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you? I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me! Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby. You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby? Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby? You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop! I don't know why ! Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that? Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now? So, aren't you going to ask me? He was a scumbag!... He wanted me , Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead ... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same. The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks. Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me. What are you talking about? Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there. Anywhere? But I thought -- Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you? Can't we just dump him fast someplace? You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders. You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place. It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is! I'm not coming back. I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take. Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you? The money's right here! Get the key! After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked. You said you couldn't kill anybody. Are you sure?... About me, I mean? Is that what changed your mind? The money? I thought you couldn't get your car. Because I know you're full of shit. Stop it. There is no us, remember? I don't think we have anything to talk about. It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it... I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and... Kill him. It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all the time. I mean all the time . It scratches up against me when we do it. Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least... At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more. Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it. Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere... Darrell? You know he and Jake are... Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here. Is it pretty? Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California? After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her... You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted more . I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away. He was a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see... ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass? It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean... You'd never understand. Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can. Nothing. Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out. It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of. I don't know how. All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me. He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole. I'm still here, aren't I? See this? Yeah, I guess you're right. I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love? Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me. No. Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way. They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em. How do you know he's still not here? Maybe I just want to hear you say it. That's not an answer. What is it you want? You never did answer my question. Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of. Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you? And what would that be? No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do? I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life. Beautiful? You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look? Lift me down. There. All done. Lift me down. It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want? Come here. Those are white words, not ours. From my father. He was the tribe's shaman. A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes. I guess it must. Thank you. Good, 'cause I liked what I saw. Did you like it; me watching you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. What happens when you lose? I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances. So, what is it you do, Mister...? Where you headed? You've been around. Where you coming from? And here I've made you all hot and sweaty. You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving? Drove into Superior? What for? You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day. You're not from around here, are you? Thank you, Bobby. Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up. It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot. You should be more careful. What happened to your hand? Do you want me to carry your pack for you? You sure you can manage? It's Grace. You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you? Maybe I don't want you to. Do you have to call me that? My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers. I'm just going to my car? Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't! You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you. No baby, you got it wrong. Anybody hurt? Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated. Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes. Like you helped her, Jake? Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff. Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass. What's the matter? No! No! Please! Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa! Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please. Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing. I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors. You haven't even looked at them once. You never said anything. About the drapes. I put up new drapes, Jake. Wrong number.Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together. Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child. What's your name anyway? You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind. Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want. That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's a cool car. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day. He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is. But you was going to fight for me. For defending my honor this afternoon. Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you. You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie. You're not from around here, are you? Where you from? Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad? You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records. How about I pick one out for you? Got any requests? What happened to your hand? I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter? Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the juke? Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone! I want to stay. Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox. Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.I call the sheriff. Hablar slowly, por favor. My ingles no es bien. Eh?He's dead . He's dead . The Fella Killed Old Shoe. What are you talking about? ...the Harvester... I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.

I'd like to mention a few names , who... Oh, MiGod.
