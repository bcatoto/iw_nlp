Everybody goes home! I'm going for 'em! I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you. Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it! I promise. You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy? So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door. Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service... If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place. It's a flop house. What do you think Mom would say? That happens, you'll get it back. It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him? I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore? Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way -- Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim. Ain't it the truth. It's the bitterest of pills. What did I say? Do what? What? What's in Mexico? Where are you taking us? Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy? What's going on? Later. Me too. Should I use the last bullets on us? Not many. Watch my back! Noooo! We have to go back for Daddy! I'm really sorry. Are you okay? Okay. You're gonna let us go? Yeah, we got a bible. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Creepy guy. Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff. -- you got your shower -- -- you got your microwave --You bet it did. Are you all right? With you? I don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission? Thirty seconds? Isn't that cutting it a little too close? I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special? He's a good man. I take it you've heard. David, don't... I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President. What do you want me to do? And when is the countdown supposed to expire? David? How'd you get this number? What? You're being paranoid. In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here. This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion. What do you want? Love was never our problem. Spunky. He told you about that? He still gets air sick, huh? In all of this I didn't get the chance to thank you two. My ex-husband works in satellite communications. David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't. We're losing them. You saved a lot of lives. I'll bet. I don't know how you put up with him. More than likely.Dick-weed. You scared the hell out of me. Sorry for what? I know, you like to make a big entrance. You're late. You're late. Dick-weed! You know, you're not as charming as you think you are. Really? You don't mind? Be careful. Wait. I have to tell you something. You said you were on leave for the Fourth. You can't go. Call them back. He's trying to impress you. Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy. Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady. Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future. Guess it doesn't really matter anymore. Don't be. I'm not. It's good money. 'Side, he's worth it. No. Exotic. I'm a dancer. He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though. He's my angel.I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not. You want some advice? Don't do this again. You know exactly what I mean. That might not be so bad... at least for you. You think they're still up there? He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. Any word from the Enterprise? But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain. It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread... I'll be fine. He's a different story. That'll be interesting. He's stable... for now. But it would be better if we could contact... our friends. There must be some good people... even in this time. Are you saying they won't help us? What are we waiting for? Let's go. Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now. I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship. Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place? But he's been dead for three hundred... Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we? Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive? Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here? Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we -- The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones... His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator. Um... yeah. Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one? At least four hours.Do it. Can you configure it? Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons. Vulcan? And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind. ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again... Isn't it better like this...? I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now. Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always. A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me? I'm your creator now. Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh? More lies. You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie. Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try? They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny... What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift. Do you know what this is, Data? That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet. You've taken your first step toward perfection. How does it feel? Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh? Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos...You've been interfering with my life ever since I met you. Don't stop now. Why? I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you. It's the future, isn't it? Just like you told Scrimm. I knew you weren't from around here. Where? And don't tell me San Francisco... You're leaving, aren't you? And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship. Or...? All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning? Lie. That's one. Keep going. Friends from Cornell... We? Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house. Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk. Too bad. Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies. I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow. No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be. You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me. You're lying. 'Fraid not. Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. Who are you? And how do you know Zephram? You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet? "Money." So you can get dome money... Bed sheets. I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years. Did you need something? Yes... and I only had enough silver halide for one shot. So you're lucky you didn't screw it up. Thank God this plate was already fixed. What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on? Take care of him. He's a very special man.I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg. I am the Borg. You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. But now... they are all one with the Borg.Mike... Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of. You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with? Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that? Anything? To do what? What else? Like what? How? Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better. I thought I was going to die. You too? Well, I left someone very special behind. Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah. ...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here. Why? You're not a real man? I thought real men don't like quiche. Yes. Like the quiche. Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine. Hi.Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might... You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back. I can call back... Are you on the other line? Hi, Mike? ...well, it suits you... ...Which one...? Can I give you a ride to your car...? ...home. It's getting late. Yeah. Well, I should be getting... Hey, at least it's not Goofy. Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right? Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these? Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career? It's not going to well? I'll have to come see you sometime. You're a comedian? Let me get a pen out of my car. Do you have something to write on? I'll be around. Me too. Well... This is it. You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.I really think you should talk to him about this. You should talk to him about this. Aren't they? No. Who? Who is it? You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. I don't believe it, Jean � they're picking straws. That is amazing. What year is it? What's that about? Pretty much the same. So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but � whatever. I'm really excited. And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published. Don't you think he's using you? So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo. What's that? Hi. You're your own baby. You mean babies with you? It looks done. Staten Island would be ok. I hadn't thought about it. Well thanks! Basquiat, don't lie. This is smack. Basquiat, what did you take? You're blaming me? I had to go see my family. It's Monday morning. Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself? What who's saying? You don't have any fucking money.. I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? How could you do that to me? Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing? A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago. I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it. Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496. I don't go there. Too many party girls. You do! You definitely do. Have you been camping? You could use a scrub. I think I could do that alone. Guess I just got sick of him. No, don't tell me � you just got fired by your crazy boss. I need this? I just don't think you're being fair. Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.I could be lying. You can't kill me yet. No. Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face. Lick me. Sure. My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though. I should be going. Five. No. Rajeev's in India. You planned this whole thing, didn't you? ... Me neither. You know what the difference is between us, Violet? How'd it go? Hey. Don't be sorry. Help me. You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you. I'm still here. We're almost there, Violet. just hang on. Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out. That means he probably will kill Johnnie. It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie. What happened? I think we're going to find out. I had a partner and she fucked me. Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart. Thank you. You'll be clean and we'll be rich. He'll have to run. If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to. Because of what you are going to tell him. You have to make it as real as you can. The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan. Not Caesar. The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust. There is no going back. If he does ... Trust me, Violet. He won't. An accident. And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. -- and shatter against the hardwood floor. Waiting in the apartment next door. We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again. Fine. Any bodyguards? What time did you say they would be there? What did Gino drink? It's getting better and better. Keep going. Has Caesar ever seen him? Does Johnnie hit on you? What happened? Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? Sweet Jesus. And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money? ... shit. Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family? Who is Gino? Why? It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other. All right, now, tell me about Johnnie. Good. Does the case lock? And where is it now? What? Then what? Exactly. You said he washed the money? I think ... The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself. I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this. All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me. I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment. All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying. I am, but ... These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob. How much money? What choice? For what? Mickey? Sounds like he wanted to get caught. He was in love with you, right? Even though he knew about you? I think so, too. I suppose he just wants to watch. Don't tell me, you're a workaholic. What about that guy this morning? What was it then? What the fuck was it? For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember? What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men? Is that what her daddy tells her? Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me? How can you sit in that bed and say that? I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different. I'm not afraid of anything. If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading. Shit, here we go. Nothing. So am I. I guess I wanted to. My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. She was always more honest than me. That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed. Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for? The redistribution of wealth. Five years is a long time. How long have you been with him? He's a launderer? How did you meet him? No. Caesar's Mafia, isn't he? Tell me about it. Don't apologize, please. I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex. Look, I don't think this is a good idea. No. You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? Why? Maybe. Curious, maybe. No. A beer? Okay, one drink. No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it. Do you have a pot or a bucket? I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink? He said you lost something. Not exactly. Thanks. Caesar is your husband? Do you know him? I don't, really. I was referred to him. '63 Chevy. Truck. Yeah. No, no trouble. There's other work to do. Are they really? Oh, I'm sorry -- A favor? Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this. Good guess. Pretty much. One day at a time. Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back. Who? Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.Caesar, you don't know shit. Caesar, don't. I knew I couldn't trust you. I should have let him kill you. Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out. I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand. We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... But everybody is all right. We were in a car accident -- Good boy. You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino. Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. You murdered Gino! Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business. Ha! What a load of crap. Look at yourself, Caesar. You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob. You rent women like you rented this apartment. Everything you couldn't. Let us go and we'll make a deal. You need the money just like we do. Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- Not until he has the money! He can't kill you -- Don't tell him -- Just hurry. Who are you going to call? What are you doing? I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here. It's not here, Caesar. Caesar, someone could see us out here. Caesar, what are we going to do? What happened to them? Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. What? Caesar, what are you going to do? For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says. Caesar ... You don't, you can't believe that ... Caesar, this is crazy. Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out. The hell I can't! This is insane! No. But it could be anywhere. The money? The money's gone. All right, Caesar. I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late -- Caesar, maybe we should run -- Caesar, what are we going to do? But you know he did it. Why? Why would Johnnie do this? Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him. I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed them. I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch. I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop. It was him. I'm positive. I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. That doesn't make any sense. You mean they weren't up here? They just left, didn't they? They were early. Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes. Don't worry, I'll get some more. I'm sorry. It was an accident. Ummm ... in the linen closet. What are you going to do with it? Caesar, what happened? Caesar, I'm serious. This is too much. I have to get out of here. Caesar, I'm leaving. That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar. Jesus, Caesar! She's doing the work herself. Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar. I didn't expect -- All part of the business. We make our own choices, we pay our own prices. ... thank you. I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. All right. How do I know you are cops? Gunfire? Is this a joke? Hello? No. I'm here, aren't I? Hey. I'm sorry, Corky ... I was so afraid you ... Oh, thank God. okay, all right. Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! What if he doesn't run? Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous. He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind. It's me. I won't. If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught? Jesus, that's beautiful. If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. C! Shit, I'm sorry! Why? I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it. When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off? I'm just asking, what if? You can't know for certain that he won't see you. What if he sees you? Shit! Oh shit! Where will you be? Poor boy, has to work so hard. Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver. The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight. Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it. Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left. He does it right in front of him. Johnnie hits on anything in high heels. Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear. Yeah, twice. Yeah. Yeah. That's his brother. Gino Marzzone. It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. Like each other? They hate each other. Johnnie? Yes. It's in a case, on his desk. In his office. I saw it this morning. To let it dry. He hung it up. Yeah. Do you think you know me like that? Is that what you think? You think I'm lying? That's why I need your help. You said you were good. Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. Shelly said it was over two million dollars. Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register? You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again? I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky. He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it. Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey. Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do. For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out. That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them. Yes. Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him. Fuck it! I think you better leave. No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman. You mean Shelly? We make our own choices and we pay our own prices. I think we're more alike than you want to admit. Work. All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. What you heard wasn't sex. I don't. I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you. Because it's the truth. We're not that different, Corky. I don't understand - ? What are you afraid of? You didn't want to see me, did you? Yes there is. I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. What's wrong? I'm glad you did. You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to. I'm already in your bed. The redistribution of wealth? What? Yes, it is. Almost five years. Basically. They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it. Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business." You have to ask? ... I needed that. I wanted to apologize. I had to see you. ... yes. If I say yes, will you take your hand away? Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator. Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you. I have a tattoo, would you like to see it? Are you surprised that I know what it is? Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky? A beer. Of course. What do you want? Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something -- Sure. I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called... Yeah, come on in. I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni. Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would call you. God, you must think |I'm a total nuisance. My pleasure. I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime. Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind. No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian. Oh, really. So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni? I knew it. Truck. Of course. That is so amazing. I'm in awe of people who can fix things. My dad was like that. We never had anything new. Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. His hands were magic. You're doing everything yourself? Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ... No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin. Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools. My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor? I guessed you were straight black. So this is temporary for you? Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building. I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee? Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator -- Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this. I know you will. I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police. Mickey! Oh God, Mickey! Oh my God. Was anyone hurt? Mickey? What are you doing here? Oh, God. Caesar wants me to stay.Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips. No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples. You'll find a girl there. Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces. How are you? I can get in the back. Buon' giorno. What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody. I think that's called looting. Where did you find that? Please don't creep around this house. I don't know what that means. What? How could he have? When? Ask him. I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts. Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me. What do you do? What are you doing here? It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or - I could help you. I could get you off that. Where've you been? Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at. If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go. So you can shoot a pistol? So was my Patient. You were in Africa? Bonjour. What do you want? Never heard of it. Would you like me to? You'd better be. Hey! - I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me. Arguing about books. Kip's another one. Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing? They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden. With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy. I liked it better when there were just the two of us. My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano. I'll probably marry him. He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban. Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire� I love that, I believe that. Who is K? Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him. He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him? He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it. This is Captain McGann. Thank you. Thank you. No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get. He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise. Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes? Excuse me - He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices. He needn't disturb you. He's Canadian. There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay. Because I'm a nurse. Are you crazy? Are you remembering more? No sand. That's your drugs speaking. I'm turning you. How? How can you see anything? I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery. Are you asleep? When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure� Candaules�you're laughing at me. I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word. Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth. I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book? I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful. Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy! I'm not sewing anything else for you! No! I'm not sewing anything else. So one day we'll meet. I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting. I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft. I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us. Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think? Kip� I - Of course. When? Nya-nya-nya! I should go to the house, get breakfast. What are you up to? You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban. But if it got late and I hadn't shown up? If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do? You loved him. Kip - come and dance with me Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man. Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case. Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers. I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy. I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die. Why would anyone do this? I follow the wires. So I follow the wires? What do I do? It's okay - I'll help. Please. I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house. Yes, for your hair. Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife. I don't think so. No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all. I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles. Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door. Oh God. Oh God. He's gone, hasn't he? Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver. Why Picton? He can't even move. I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol. When he dies I'll catch up. The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion? What if you couldn't find him�? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning. Does he have to go? I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine? He's sleeping. You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance. Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please. I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever� you and Lieutenant Singh� Hello. I thought that was for when we were very very old? I was looking forward to this evening. You've got a mustache. I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed. Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling. I know. Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead. Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you. Oh dear. Shall we be all right? Don't leave me! It's so cold. Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you. You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk. Don't you know you drove everybody mad? Why did you hate me? It hurts too much. Please don't move me. It hurts too much. A surprise, he said. I can't move. I can't get out. Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think? No. You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists Don't do this. Would you let me pass? What? You will. You will. I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him. I'd better get back. Say goodbye here. Shall we be all right? That day, had you followed me to the market? This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife. I thought we were against ownership? I can stay tonight. You bastard, I was believing you! It's beautiful. What's it about? Arabic? This is - what is this? This is empty, just coming! No. What? No! A lie. What do you hate most? Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Alm�sy nods. What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths. Now. Now. A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes. You sew very badly. I'm impressed you can sew. Don't. Will you please come in? Will you not come in? Do they know them? No, the marriage isn't a fiction. Geoffrey's not in Cairo. He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance. Find that plant. Cut out its heart. Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have? Oh my God, the others! Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More. Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not. Shall we be all right? This is not very good, is it? They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them. What am I looking at? I'm quite all right, thank you. And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would. I'd like you to have them. I thought you might paste them into your book. Ask Al Auf. Alm�sy asks Al Auf in Arabic. You sing. All the time. Actually, you sing. Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who? What is he saying? Come on, what did he say? Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in? What do you mean, poetry? So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it? You felt obliged to. After the market, you followed me to the hotel. Why did you follow me yesterday? Excuse me. I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market? I don't care to bargain. I don't want to go back. Excuse me? Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why? Hello! Good morning. Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story? I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it� Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms? I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives. What? Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise. Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted. Aren't you? I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot. I'm fine. I got hot. Oh. Why do you think? About my staying? Darling, for goodness' sake! Oh really? But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this - I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic. Darling, Peter says I could stay� How awful. What will you do? Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann. It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior - No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Alm�sy, who doesn't look up from his book. I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes. I don't think so. Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.Well, okay - thank you, Detective. Oh, no, I can't let you do that. Where'd you get him that parka? Oh, he's adorable. Oh, now he's adorable. You have children? Oh, yah, I know that! This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time. End a April. ...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then. Uh-huh. Uh-huh... A what? Mm. Pretty darn good, ya want some? Oh, yah? And what about the other fella? Is there anything else you can tell me about him? So you were having sex with the little fella, then? Was he funny-looking apart from that? Can you be any more specific? In what way? Where you girls from? Yah, that can happen. Uh-huh. Yah? Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like. I'm sorry, sir, I - Sir? Right now? Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here. ... I'm sorry, sir? I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of - Yah, but - but do you know that for sure without - So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently? Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know? Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected. Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering - I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here. Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then. Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then? Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox. ...Mr. Lundegaard? Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera? Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson - ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard? Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here. I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here - Mr. Lundegaard? Oh, yah? Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35? How we doin' on that vehicle? Yah. Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685? Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR? I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou. Uh-huh. You look in his citation book? No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers. Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet? Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back. You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya? Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame. Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy. There's two of 'em, Lou! Let's go take a look at that trooper. Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs. Yah. Now I'm hungry again. ...Well, that passed. I'm fine - it's just morning sickness. Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf. I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd. Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal. Where is everybody? Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide? Hiya, Lou. Aw, Norm. Aw, you can sleep, hon. That's okay, hon. I gotta run. Yah. ...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet. It's okay, Mike... It's okay... It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think? Well, I always liked you, Mike. Better times. I'm sorry, Mike. No, I didn't... I'm sorry. It sounds like you're doin' really super. Well, they're a good outfit. I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh? No, no, that's fine. No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck. No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that. Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids? Oh, yah, a long time ago. You're livin' in Edina, then? ...This is a nice place. Just a Diet Coke. Yah - easy there - you do too! I'm expecting, ya know. Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya. Yah - how are you doon? Okay, ya know. Okay. Yah, that's me. Yah. No, that's okay. Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it? So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya? ...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that. Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide... Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater. ...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole - Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning. It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling. Anyone else residing there? Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace? Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters. Copy. Yah, send me back-up! My car! My car! Tan Ciera! There's the car! There's the car! Copy. Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson? Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake. Copy. And Lundegaard too. Sorry - didn't copy. But we still haven't found Gustafson. Gustafson's accountant. And this guy is... The day of our homicides. Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise. Oh. Geez. Oh. Oh, my. So... they didn't... Linda Cooksey? Linda. Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' - Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's - No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd. Norm? ...Mike Yanagita! ...Well, yah. Who's this? Yah? Hello? I love you, Norm. That's terrific. When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones! Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps! It's terrific! Norm, that's terrific! Your mallard? ...So? They announced it? Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there? Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good. No, no. Oh, fine. Oh, pretty good. They bitin'? They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them. Aw, hon, you're better'n them. ...How's the paintin' goin'? You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's? Yah. Prowler needs a jump. Hon? Thanks, hon. Time to shove off. Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding. Boy, this thing is really... geez. Oh, my. Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home? And his wife? Uh-huh....What're you talking about? I don't know. Few munce. I don't think so. It's nice. Wuddya do? Carl looks around. Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know... And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large. His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C. She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is. We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.I'm ok mommy. What do you mean? Mommy? You're scaring me! H-how long will it take? What about all my other stuff? Where are we going to go, mommy? Are we leaving mommy? I'm scared! Ok... She's down... She talks to me. Yes. It's going to hurt us! Maybe it was Colleen... I didn't do anything, mommy. Can I do it again tonight? Mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night. Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy? Help me! Please!!! She's down. Help her... She's hiding. She's here. She says she's lonely... Mommy! Good night daddy. Are we going back to California daddy? Daddy help! Daddy, please!!! Mommy please help me! I can't move! It's dark! I can't breathe! Look daddy! It's empty! Did you ever see a leprechaun? Did you grow up in Ireland mister? Why? What's he doing daddy? I want this one, daddy. Can I have this room daddy?Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby - Your father doesn't love us anymore! Go to your room! Now! We'll get it later. We're going to go someplace new. Yes, we'll be leaving soon. My angel! Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner! She's down...how do you mean honey? Can you talk to her? Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen? No it won't - no it won't! Who...is Colleen? Well then who did?! Don't play games with me, little girl. We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey. Well I bet you they're happy. Sure. You're bleeding. I'm ok. What's happening! We'll destroy you...destroy all of you! We're not going. Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me? Do you think I'm a fool? You don't think I know? Should I... I'm fine. You seem to appreciate the local scenery. Aubrey! She's gone! Oh my God where is she! Good. I'll start bringing things in. How are we doing? You, an imaginary friend. That's what she calls her. She has a...friend. Colleen. Are you ok? I'm sure this sounds crazy to you. Voodoo stick? It's nothing like that Will. You're just being cynical. What about keeping an open mind? I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff. Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it. Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all. Well what do you think it is? But do you agree with me? I don't know what I'm saying. Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off. The videotape... Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event - What is it? Didn't you just see the power go off and on? I just had a bulb break on me! Were you fooling with the power? Ok. She's asleep. I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things. What the hell is that? It's not going to work. I'm too smart for you. Are you playing tricks on me? I don't think she willed it to me out of sentiment. She didn't even know who I was. It's just... tradition. Not really. She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland. I really don't think anyone knew about this place. I wish I knew more about her. To our family. It's just going to take a while. You didn't think much about that before. Aubrey knows more about us than you think. I just, I don't know... Will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while. Must be... Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't. I'll have to call her. I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service. Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater. I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon. Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea? You'll have to settle for turkey. Yeah, they told us this was the best. Maura. Before. Ok, so we have a...presence. What do we do about it? She's at school. We've tried not to upset her more than she's been. What about the other five percent? What do you mean, unfortunately? I think we should do it. We don't know. Well that's what we're here for. I mean - Come back to us honey! Come back to us honey, don't be afraid! Aubrey? It's mommy. So what should we do, father? Why? What! Well it's nice that you were there for her. It was a shame. Did you know her very well? Oh, that's nice... Yes, I am.Oh Jerry. I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work. No one has ever dumped me. You've never been alone and you can't be alone -- Didn't hear it. No. Don't say it. We're both ragged out right now. What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember? It's not "love me." It's not "trust my handshake." It's make the sale. Get it signed. There shouldn't be "confusion" about that. Jerry. You and I are salespeople. We sell -- I have to finish my job -- It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me -- Oh honey. It's spun. I just heard. Jerry! Do something -- You lost your head, it happens. I'm so fuckin jazzed! Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft? Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either -- Let's go. I'll drive you. _ 45. I'm sorry. I was on a roll. I meant something else. When do you want to leave? You are not a loser. King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room! Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire. Good. They're all heatseekers! All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you. Ugh! And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush? Who told you? Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey. Jerry, this is what intimacy is! Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!! Don't ever stop fucking me!Still going. He's asleep, right? Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense. Don't let him stay up too late. Wait. Did I just say "hon" to him? Aw, shut up. You had me at hello. _ 130. Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me. _ 118. There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends. Oh please. My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is. A nice long break. I know. I watched it. I sort of know it by heart. I think we made a mistake here. Why fucking not! I deserve it. I don't know -- I don't need you to "stick." I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid. I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us. I did this. And at least I can do something about it now. It's not fair to you. This whole -- It's my fault. Why do you love me? Okay... I will... And I really don't know your noises yet. Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours. No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't... Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever... Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it. This rig? Phht. No problem. Fine, I just -- Oh God. Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this? No. I have to go in. I live here. I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel. Good night. Let's not tell our sad stories. Yeah. It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- Jerry? Maybe you should call her. Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but -- We'll see you soon, honey. Bye. Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny? Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. _ 86. Oh good. I'm relieved you said that. Yeah, what happened there. You don't have to explain. Plus, you could use that commission. Actually he said "glad." _ 85. Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy. Good evening. I may not sue. No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas. Yeah, I did. Don't worry about it, boss. Well. I'm working with you because of that memo... What you wrote inspired me. _ 79. Truth? -- especially one like this. Don't worry about me. I can get jobs -- Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you a cab. Beer okay? Sure -- Sorry. Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too. Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it? Too bad. Oh my God. He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp. Hey you. Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right? Call me later, hon. Happy for us... okay. Here's the number. 404-453-2222. Well, I'm happy for you. I just got goosebumps. We are? ... light. Wait. That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is... Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff. Honey -- later, okay? Whoop. Wait. That took guts. Absolutely. No no, I know -- And I guess we didn't talk about money. So, I'll just dive in -- So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right? My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40. Oh no. I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up. Thanks, though. Bye. -- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" -- Oh tsht. Yes. I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act. Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise. Oh no. And have fun at your bachelor party. Well, thanks. My son... my mind... Hmm. Pretty good. Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm -- Oh, tell the story. Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him. I love him, and I don't care what you think. I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him. Please, if I start talking -- No-- Oh, knock it off! _ 89. That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? I mean, he must have been needing that. Thanks. I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath. Look at me, Laurel, look at me. I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world! How do I look? As opposed to twenty angry women? That's the girl I love. Thank you. No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen. Honey, he's engaged. And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in. He just lost his best client. He called from the plane. I invited the guy over. He's coming over. Wait. Where is he? Of course I know -- If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too. Of course, medical! _ 42.Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details -- Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung. Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head. First you gotta tell me something. No no. Don't cry at the beginning of the date. Forgot your keys -- Good. But you just gotta hear me out on one thing. You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house. Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74. This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest. Wait. Use the frosted glasses. I heard. Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome." It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome. And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you. At eleven at night? _ 70. He's in the living room asleep. You know how much those Well Child exams cost -- You are a single mother. You have given up the right to be frivolous. What about medical?Jerry. You two will be together forever. How sad -- Oh no -- _ 14. To the pools? That's when you need to cement, and define define define. Gorgeous. Oh, tell the story. Tell me, and then you can sleep. It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?! Tell me about your fiancee. And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships. I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend? Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend? Bobbi Fallon. BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs. You're with the sports people on the plane, right? What --Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. They all been real straight with me. No, sir. Not at all. They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us. Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's-- I do, sir. I mean, follow orders, sir. Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you. It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer. You really want to know, sir? The--the officers. Follow orders. Do whatever they say. I am, sir. I-I can do the job, sir. Yes, sir-- I'm sorry, sir. No, sir-- Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank you, Sergeant Major. Will this go on my record? Out of the Army? Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves? I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy-- From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street. Yes, Sergeant. You're testing me? I'm feeling okay-- Sergeant? I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble. We were just dancing-- If I had I wouldn't have gone in.Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam. "I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people. This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow. 350 pounds. No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you? You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound-- You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it? Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead. Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone? Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now". You look awful good in that uniform, though. Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny. --they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her. --and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal-- Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop-- Do I seem jumpy? Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press? Oh. Right. And you're in--? The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors. A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it. Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see! Tipico. This girl has a child? I thought you were married! This girl is a friend of yours? You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals-- Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here? Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso? You have somebody else out there? In English, Enrique. We're in the United States-- What are you doing out there? Are you crazy? Quien es? [Who is it?] Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car-- En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English. I never said that. It was just that boy-- I felt that you could do better for yourself-- I never said that. I don't mean Fernando. Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit? I was too busy. A little older than Paloma is now. He was killed. You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them. Why would I want to go there? Did you come here to tell me how to run my business? Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy. If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan! These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'. Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite. Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime. Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for. Not if I can help it. We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April. I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away. Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone. You ever play one of these? Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior. That's me.Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help. I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age. If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled. That isn't true. I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for-- You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized-- How do you think you're going to make a living? Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me. That makes it okay? Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things. So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends. --you're going to be on your own. I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college-- Leave your sister out of it. Oh, come on, Amado-- You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam. I'm unmarried. I'm not available. The Sheriff. All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish. Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner. Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack. Steve? "That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes! What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos-- You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody. Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails." Thank you. Nobody's too busy. There must have been somebody. How come you never got married again? Right. When he was killed. Mami, how old were you when my father-- Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon-- No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up-- If you spent a little more time training them-- Well, you hire illegals-- Maybe you're just getting less patient. I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt-- I don't think you can take it personally-- He's going to wish he was dead. Okay? He's not here? Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys. I only went for my last two years. Enough with the clothes-- Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma. Yeah. I had uhm--school business. It's Saturday. What do you think? For a while. Yeah? It doesn't have anything to do with being smart. Of course you can. Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right? We start from scratch-- I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about-- From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected. They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this-- I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before. Didn't know she owned one. Couple months before I was born-- She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean. Eladio. Eladio. Cruz. Yeah? It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment-- Like your story is over. There's nothing on the walls. No pictures-- How long have you lived here? So what are we gonna do about this? How come it feels the same? Wow. Yeah? When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it. I mean what did we know about anything? I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children. We thought we were something, didn't we? Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam. I should get back. They've got me. Different thing. It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own. You don't want to be Sheriff. So why did you come back here, Sam? Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars. With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal. He hates me. Amado. Weird what you remember. I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know-- I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I-- People liked him. I thought you got through that pretty well. So she tells me three times a week. A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing-- I can't name anybody she does like these days. Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty. Are you okay? We haven't talked since high school. Somebody called--something about an electronics store. They've got my Amado.Yes. Don�t Jim. All ten million. Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here. Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why.. You knew about Jim? Krieger. Krieger can get it. Right? Always. It�s all right, Ethan..you�ll bring me back...won�t you... This stuff is so sticky. Ethan? Ethan�s right behind me. Listen to me Jim. Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money. Ethan takes the blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him. Two cars. Where are you? Ethan...Kittridge is on the train. Yes.......come here....viens pres moi... Okay... What happened? What are you going to do? Bastard! I'm going to try and get some sleep. I'm so sorry. Krieger was my call. I've never worked with him. I'm sorry, Ethan. What about you? You didn't have to......... You don't think we're going to make it. Sure... What kind of help? Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this. We've got seventy-five rounds for your Glock 9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself -- if I'm not dead, I'm with you. Max made a deal with you? The message is for Job. Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do... What are you going to do? Why haven't they brought us in yet? No one sent me! We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --! Who is they, who is they? Who is "they?" I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so I walked away. What? They're dead. Jim's dead. What happened to Jim? What happened to Jim? No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge. I wasn't. I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio. He said someone was... Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay. It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you? Roger that. Oh yeah? Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you? Sleeping's better. I'm walking. I want to sleep. Can I sleep here. Did we get it?I wouldn�t worry about him. Once you�ve got the money -- he�ll find you. The possibility alone is worth ten million. Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314. Ha, dear boy! I do hope this doesn�t prelude a meeting in private. I'm going to have to front you personally. Don't lose that money without losing your life. How will you make sure I'll have the list in three days? It's been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy? Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by the end of the week. Six million dollars. I'll give you the same. But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world. I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket. My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn't pass muster. Deal's off. Very good. Mm - Hmmm... It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir. Why should I? I don't know Job any more than he knows me. Why, may I ask? Ah, but, we're asking about you. And how might you know that? Are you another Company man? It's quite out of the question. On what? The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox. Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you? Who are you and what are you doing here? Phew! We�ve got five minutes... Run it through from the top. Is something wrong with the phone? Well is something wrong with the batteries? Try it again. What�s the problem. This wasn�t what we discussed. How long until we reach the Chunnel? Doesn't mean it's a signal. Could just be the hard drive heating up. That's not so good for you, my friend.Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell... ..don't. I'm warning you. I think you're drunk. I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you. Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell. I think I'd like to dance. How do you do? If I change my mind. Would you mind? I'm trying very hard to be polite about it. Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash. I haven't been invited. I'm sure you have. I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing. Not tonight. Yes? I'm supposing. Thank you. Very nice Mitchell turns. I don't know. I really don't know. Well.. Is it? I expected to go to the Vancouver Royal. Should I have a reservation? Perhaps I don't take it so lightly. I'm going to Vancouver, Mr. Mitchell. How far does this train go? I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell. No thanks, I've seen Seattle. They might think I was running away from something. Immigration Officer? How long would that take? How soon can I get a plane to Seattle? I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like? Bank? I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr. Campbell here? Do you think I was faking? Yes. You. You're not really a murderer yet. If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself? Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick. When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either. It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time. The water is cold down there-- But so is everything else. And there's you. Every day of your life you'll want me. You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror-- But the next one is murder. First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back. You could tell about Mitchell. You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it. You could never tell about me. Magruder does. And that nasty man that followed us last night. You didn't kill him. Yes. Yours. You haven't murdered anybody. You killed Mitchell. Wasn't that an accident? It must have been. If you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can't talk anymore. And I'm begging for my life--and yours. You'll never make it. You've out- smarted yourself. So that I will never be found. I guess I'm a little screwy. Maybe I could believe it. Should I try? You-killed-him? He'll come back...They always come back when you give them money. That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning. I'm beginning to wonder about him, too. Was he really following me--or you? The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon. Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal. Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please. You big, open-handed, generous guy. That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it? What your father did doesn't condemn you. If it was an accident, you could have told the truth. Larry Mitchell found out. So you killed him. Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way. Funny, I never thought of you that way. You were so close too. We were all pretty stupid about you. I thought you had to be back to the hotel. To leave my--my note. If you're doing all this just for me. I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder. Frozen. I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising. Killaine's wise to what? You leave it. You wouldn't like it. I've been there. Do you have to leave the note? This must have cost a fortune. Killaine... But that's what I'm doing. Couldn't they think of that? And Betty Mayfield-- They'll look for you. I was tried for murdering my husband. Guilty. The judge set the verdict aside. There was one man on the jury-- --but he was afraid. They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course. My father-in-law will never give up. Never. He promised me that. So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina. And it happens all over again. Almost the same thing. Almost the same way. Do you wonder about this-- Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself. Yes. I've never been very far from it, for a long time. Will you do something for me? That wasn't why I called you. Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope? Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store. With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap. Perhaps you're right. Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked. I have my own warrant. Stop a minute, please. They're going to arrest me. I hated to go to that place. I almost went to the police station instead. There's another man--right outside the booth here. I never saw him Before. I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store. That man last night--the one that followed me-- So have I. Nothing matters. Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it? No matter. There's nothing I can do about it. All right--following me. He was following us--but he's not a policeman. You don't know who he is? Absolutely sure. Then he's-- Then he's got to be a detective. We walked right passed him. He's following us. That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby. They know you here--know your name. Dance? Here? Is this the best you can do? You, too? My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it. Certainly not to me. Dance? Tonight? There's a lot of night left to live through. What time is it? That's putting it mildly. Bad enough. There's one thing I may as well tell you. You'll find it out anyhow. I tried to run away--when I found him out there on the balcony. There wasn't any plane. No thanks. There wasn't any plane. Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter. That's all there is. He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in. On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me. I don't. No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it? Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything. There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there. There's one less tonight. You said it wasn't a tragedy. Much too late. No thank you. You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind? Do you think I don't? I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours. I didn't say anything. Would it make you anymore amusing? You're drinking it. And do you amuse the guests? You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table. As I said before... You don't sound as if you liked him very much. What did you say his name was? I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties. I see. Your liquor laws.. I see. No, please. Ale. I don't mind. Beer? Well, all right. I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please. But I tell you---if you'd only understand. No, Jeff. You don't. He's not a murderer, I tell you. He;s not a murderer. He could have killed me a dozen times. You'd never have known. Not sometimes. Always. Just because it is the hard way. You're that kind of man, Jeff. You do things the hard way, don't you? But even if you were in love with me. What proper grounds? You can't be in love with me. You hardly know me. I'm not in love with you. What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound? Because I make you think of magnolias? I thought policeman was something like a soldier. That his duty came first. However much he might happen hate it. You're still a police officer, Jeff. I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me. What will they do to you? To do what? Because you think your in love with me? They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind. I always wear gloves when I shoot people. A bad joke--but better than tears. Looking for peanuts, I suppose. Jeff. Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with? What do your friends call you?-- The ones that know you well?--and like you very much? Very ridiculous. What does he see? Points very straight to her. You wouldn't even try There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector. I expected nothing else. I don't want to talk. There isn't anything you can do. You understand perfectly. Nobody can help me. You, least of all. You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl. You--or the Vancouver Police Department? The police always do, don't they? You were there when I last saw him. Is it a crime? Who hasn't--one way or another? You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known. We wouldn't have met at all. I've never been to Florida. Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue. Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment. That was a crude trick. Why don't you arrest me and be done with it. A graduation present. Yes. Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him? I'm sorry. Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine? Who told you I was married? It is? You didn't ask a question. You made a speech. I'm sorry, that's all there is. I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am. I don't know her.. or particularly want to.Don't make me... I can't... I won't. What? ...leave me alone... please... You tricked me... It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. No it's not. It was Jason. ...please... no... Please go away! Leave us alone! NOOOO.... Michael... Michael Myers. I can't think. Please..stop... I don't know... No... Don't do this. I can't... ...please... No... please. Please don't do this... What kind of game? NOOO! No... Why are you doing this? Please don't hurt him. Where are you? How do you know his name? So you better leave. I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. What do you want? I'm two seconds from calling the police. Is this some kind of a joke? Listen, asshole... No-bored. Dial someone else, okay? What do you want? Yes? Gotta go. Nah, I don't think so... I have to go now. That's not what you said. What did you say? Why do you want to know my name? No. Why? You wanna ask me out? The first one was, but the rest sucked. Yeah... Freddy Krueger. Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours? I don't know. Uh-huh. Just some scary movie. I'm getting ready to watch a video. Uh-huh. Popcorn. I don't think so. Who is this? Hello. They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. What? You're forgiven. Bye now. So why did you dial it again? Hello. It happens. Take it easy. I think you have the wrong number. What number are you trying to reach? Who are you trying to reach? Yes.I'll get my camera. Sidney's father? People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism. What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist... I like it. It's... sexy. So is Dewey your real name? Can I bring Kenny? I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? What kind of lead? Mind if I join you? Then what are you doing here? You never know when or where a story will break. Deputy... good evening. You are precious. Please, call me Gale. Am I keeping you? I'm sorry. He's not a suspect, is he? Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father? Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there. Boy, you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer. Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out? I know, I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker but who knew? Please, call me Gale. You look awfully young to be a police officer. And why is that? Has something happened? Productive. So they're closing down the school? Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY. As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote. What's the delay? Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities. Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof. No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. Jesus! The camera-hurry! But couldn't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat? The same person who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him? The same person who really killed your mother? He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him... Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all. Many times. I think you falsely identified him. Yes. He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think. What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that. Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it. I owe you shit. Forget it. Kenny. Camera. Now. Just stay back. I'll send you a copy. It'll be out later this year. Yes, that's right.Ricki Lake. And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression. Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. Maybe she's a slut just like her mom. Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage. What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? For attention. The girl has some serious issues. She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.Where do you get this shit? Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered. You're evil. Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy. And why would she do that? Why would she lie about it?Not my daughter... not my... I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her. The phone's dead. Where is she? What is it? Where's Casey? I told you to send it back.Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy. Not so fast. We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS? Are you alone in the house? Stop it! I don't understand... Why did you kill my mother? Fuck you. NO! Don't believe him. I thought you were... No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you. Uh-huh. No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him. When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call? Who did you call? Yeah... I think so. You heard me. Or even a good porno. I wanna let go. I do... But this is life. This isn't a movie. Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense. I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something... But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was. No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress. So... It's okay. We need to talk. Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere. Tomorrow. One year tomorrow. No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom. No... You know that's not true. I'm so sorry... please understand. I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house. No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me. Jesus, SHIT! He's here. He's trying to kill me... Oh Billy... Please... God... Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship? You know what my dad will do to you? So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump. Oh it did? Now that it's out of your system. What are you doing here? My dad's in the other room. What are you doing here? Billy? What the... Should I be worried? Have they found my father? Yeah. Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. And my Dad? Any word on him? Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. Any word on my Dad? I don't know. I guess. At the airport. Did you reach my Dad? ...yeah... I saw him leaving wearing it. He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat. Has his story changed? Have you talked to Cotton? During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar. Do you still think he's innocent? And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories. You owe my mother. Please. You owe me. Off the record. No cameras. I want to talk to you. I'm not here to fight. I'll look for it. How's the book? It's okay, Tatum. She's just doing her job. Right, GALE? Who are you? LEAVEMEALONE! Hello? Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now. What am I doing? Can you see me right now? So where are you? Why would you call me from my front porch? So where are you? So who are you? That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy. Because they're all the same. It's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who can't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door. They're ridiculous. Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit. I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy. Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over. I have no idea. Have a good trip. Got it. ...out at the airport... No you didn't. Can you knock? Only if it's a nice Meg Ryan movie. Don't come any closer. Stop. Right there. THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? So Stu, what's your motive? Billy's got one. The police are on their way. What are you going to tell them? You'll never get away with this. You're crazy -- both of you. Why are you doing this? If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood. Yeah, okay... whatever. Are you serious? Why are they doing this? Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey? Deal. TATUM! What secret meaning? Like a Satanical thing? No way. How does that get you in the mood with Stu? Who? What do you think about when you're having sex? But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic? Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax. Is Billy going to be there tonight? Oh, god... You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me. If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there. And you believe it? Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers. If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? So you think my mom was a slut too? I don't know... It was him, Tatum. I know it. I bet he's pissed. This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. Just a sec... I need to talk to someone. It's alright. I'll get it. He was there, Tatum. No, nothing's like it used to be. Just another sleepover at the Riley's. It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up. Whatever. Just hurry. I'm not worried. It's past seven. Thanks, Tatum. Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back. Tell your mom I said thanks. You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday. How do you gut someone? They think it's school-related? Do they know who did it? Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. No way. What happened?What is she doing here? Shit. No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night. Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out -- we'll be perfectly safe. I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. Hey... Dewey. Can we go now? Yes, you doofus. Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late. I thought Blockbuster fired you. Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night? Stu was with me last night. There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight. Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out. Watch the show, Sid. His basket is bigger than the one you're pushing. Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..." During foreplay, I sing the theme song to myself. "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." It's a real turn on. Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman. With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve. Billy and his penis don't deserve you. You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out. He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? Come on, let's rock. Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us. Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it. It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men. You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor. I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman. Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. Come on. Pathos has it's perks. This could be good. What do you think, Sid? It was just some sick fuck having a laugh. Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. Shit, what is he doing here? I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. Come on, Sid. Take a message. I knew this guy was too perfect. He was destined to have a flaw. Do you really think Billy did it? Just like old times, ain't it? Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us. Bye. Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis. Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten. Practice ran late. I'm on my way. Later. I'll be there by seven. I promise Yeah, yeah... are you okay? No prob. I'll pick you up after practice. Or a man's mentality. They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big. Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors... Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside. And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end. Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night. Do you believe this shit? What am I? The beer wench? Tits -- see. That's mature. For once, Stu, drop it. You know if I were accused of carving up two people, I'd take the opportunity to skip school. I thought you dumped her for me. That is so sexist. The killer could easily be female -- BASIC INSTINCT. Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?I'll be back in a little bit then. All right, y'all gonna go with me? Would y'all like that? It went real good. We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed. What do you want, hun? Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave. That might be better than this. You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good. This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it. He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk. Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on. No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you. Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle. Please Doyle, don't. What? He does make some funny noises. I just feel sorry for the poor thing. Let's go, Vaughan. Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over. Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty. You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'. He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream. Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet. He's just mentally retarded, I guess. Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way. I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think. Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long. I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you. Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right. Huh? I know he does. I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop. Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too. What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep. No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh? I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight. He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it. Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio. I'm glad of it, honey. How come Karl won't eat here with us? Maybe you and Karl want to go with us? Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop. He's mentally retarded, poor thing. Nice to meet you, Karl. Hey, sweetheart. What you up to? We sure like havin' you. Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either. Yeah. All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow. Where'd he go? What's goin' on? Well, okay. I got you some. Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things? You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that? Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out. I believe you. I really do. Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well? That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown? Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm. It's all right. You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that? Okay. Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy. Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all? Right now? I'll be dog. Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'? You scared me. Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go? Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl? That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all? Vaughan, don't get pushy. Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'? I don't think he sees you as a guy guy. He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass. Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry. I know. Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?Why won't he talk to women? No, we have to get this story. Do you smell shit? In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you? Will he be supervised? Where will he go? I didn't mean that. Is he leaving right this minute? Signs? Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time. How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions? That's really strange. What does it mean? Before they were married? I knew he slept in a toolshed. Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him. Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here. No thank you. Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know. Yes sir. Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.Mm-hm. Yeah, I guess. Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing. Yeah. It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me. Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first. No. Oh, maybe. Fuck. Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated. Intense. Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA. Sure, all the time, in Group. Yeah. Knock yourself out. I don't anymore. Um-hm. Mn-hm. We are? Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming? You didn't get me in trouble. Uh, home, you know. Typical male. Typical male. Responsibility, progress. Uh-huh. It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title? Slides go with it. Yeah! That was really great. I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay. Now? I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know? Right now? Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them. Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow. No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing. Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy. Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it. Oh. A cloud? Oh. Well, what's it on? What's it about? Hey, you said you did a video? Hey. Do you have a cigarette? Yeah, when's he coming? No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs. You better! Yes! Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig. Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape? Playing with something really hot. Yeah. I'm so burnt-out. Alright, Pony! Buff is funny. God. In what way? Pony, what would you say our relationship is? Am I fucking him? What do you mean? His girlfriend? Sure I am. It's fun. Oh, you were in the band? Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield. I'm sorry. It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about? Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson. Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food. I know. It's okay. That's what I mean. We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk. Deep down. Way down. Erica. I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know? Let's see. You cut off your little finger? Mm. Really? Mm-mm. I'd like to. You think I'm rich and you hate me. You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like? Yeah. So, what about you? A Porsche. You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW. He is. Yes. Thinks he is. Well, he is. Maybe upper-middle-class. No, not really. Middle-class. No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air. Hi. It's nice here. It's different. Mm-mm. It's coming along. It does look good. Pony and I are friends. Nice to meet you Sooze. Hi, I'm Erica. Hi, I'm Erica. Hi. I'd love to read that. Mm. I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice. Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it. Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony. Oh, wow. Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you. Great. Hi. I'm Erica. He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble. Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously? Typical male. Yes. I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something. Why is everything about you, Jeff? Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff. What did you guys think? Was it okay? Really? Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went? Sure. You make art and you want people to see it. Come on. Hey, I'm Sooze. Jeff! Let's go! I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death. You really suck, you know that? What? 'Bye, Jeff. You did, huh? Good for you. You're unbelievable. Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not? What about us? I'm moving away your staying here. I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know. I've run out of words. Shit, Jeff! Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away. For a ride. I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it. Is that a threat? God, you smell like whiskey. Mm. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. What? Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't. Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony. Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you. Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on. Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come. Come on. Jeff! You do. Yes, you do. Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing. Mm. So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me? So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist? Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield? My goal is to make art. Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes? New ground? No one does nothing, Jeff. So what do you wanna do? Come with me. Of course. What feelings? What? Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty. Jeff. Jeff. How? Okay, what would you have done. Oh, yeah? It got that close. It was a racial incident. This is ridiculous! Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him. Um, because you didn't want to go. I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being? Typical male. You know, all you know is what's good for you. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you. What? What do you stand for? But do you stand for anything? No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit. I'm talking about idealism. Your completely missing the point. God, KAREN JOHNSON. Of course I do! Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial... About things that are important to me. Yes, you asshole. I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change. So you can give me more shit? Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl. Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows. I don't want to hear it anymore. I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York. It's a piece. Man? No. No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now. I hate that. You could've come over. What the fuck are you talking about?! Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up? "Don't write any checks you can't cash." You know, my mom has this saying. Oh, my god! Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life. Yeah, I know what you're saying. Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past. Me? Yeah. I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go. Oh, yeah, you're just so smart. What's that supposed to mean? Soon. No, I'm going. I'm moving. Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world. Oh, yuck! Oh, gross! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jesus, Jeff. You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it. That was so great! Alright! Yeah, come on, play it. Yeah. Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do. Yeah? Would I get paid? Oh they'd never let me do what I want. You're not serious. You do not want me to do your cover. Yeah? Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now? Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee. You do not! Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint. You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York. No, she was just sitting there?! Like? Yeah? So? What's L.A. like? Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances. Oh! No, no, it isn't. It's cool. Is that your driver? You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man! Pony, oh my god! Tim, go throw up somewhere. Could you give me a ride? Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore. It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time. Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough. Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax! Jeff! Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too. Leave him alone, Tim. Come on, Jeff. You have the largest penis. Can we go please? Hey, Tim, you know what? You win. Hey, Tim. Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left. At least I have a point of view, you know? Fuck. The fuck not? I'm going out later.Don't swear it's impolite. You know the fuck not. No car.Well, he's young and he's healthy. What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you? Sixteen next month. That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now. I've got a boyfriend, Mark. So why have you told me about it? Unless you get caught. The point is, you've got to find something new. Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway. You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop. Too young for what? Smells like it. I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is. Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell? Is that a promise, then? Are you clean? Can I see you again? Calm down. You're not going to jail. In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night. Holding hands? I don't see why not. And don't make any noise. No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you. Out. Right. You can't sleep here. Shut up. Ssshh! Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue. Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that? What? It's where I live. I'm going home. Diane. Thanks.Spud, they're my sheets. No problem for me either. Honestly, it's no problem. There's no need. I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now. Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses? Homeless people? What do you see as your main strengths?Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...? But I had to use my hands. None before you could kill with their mind. Graham, my dear. Your uncle...? ...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster.

And this - if you decide to take the rest. Other properties as well - here and in Europe. And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics. Liquid funds over eighty million. tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now. I'm tired. I need to rest. A Mayfair it ever I saw one. In the coffin, my dear. where else...? You came. I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear. Out of the question Rowan, coming here will not change the - A very tired one. I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.
