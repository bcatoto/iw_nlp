in that goddamn medievaljacket hes probably the one who killed you thats all you got from him that bastard helped take your life away from you william youre not making sense its sunday beat i dont

here drink this ill get the heat going its not a prison its a hospital theres got to be some way out of there and youve got to find it youve got to get yourself out of that place theyre going to kill you if you dont what about captain medley he never told them what happened to you over there his testimonythat coward wanted them to think you were crazy they told me beckers in shelbourne now i looked him up and he was listed how long do we have because thats the part i believe is true you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugenes name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled lets see if they have an address for becker i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with you think lorenson kills you me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene no they never figured it out i did most murderers dont stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road not without hurting them i know alpine grove still exists i looked it up on the net we should go there and see if theres still anyone around who might have known what happened to you then we need to figure out what happened to you its the only thing we can do softly i want to trust you should i trust you i dont know beat i thought i was crazy after you left that day i died i still think i could be crazy but then i replayed that night in my head the parts of it i could remember and it was likei dont care if i was or am i havent felt that way in a room with someone my whole life beat and when you left all i wanted was i dont know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it beat you bled to death but no one knew until after it was banned you know and it led to an investigation of dr beckers mistreatment of some of his patients thats when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients the jacket thats what they call it right please im telling you i dont care what time you think youre in youre not william starks beat i dont believe in many things but i believe in death and it doesnt give back what it takes so whoever you arei did a nice thing youve made me regret it enough already so please just leave no its not beat its december 25th 2004 i know what this isi picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought im just fucked up enough to fall for this but the thing is i know what im doing when i drink i just usually dont care right now i do though and i want you out now i dont know but he did die starks falters under the news jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up no you didnt they found william starks body dead in the snow i looked it up his body was found new years day 191993 at alpine william starks is dead beat ive been to his grave you cant be william starks hes dead stop it stop it jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes starks eyes plead right back well you belong in one what now youre gon na show me some kind of drivers license if you dont get out of my house right now ill call the police whatd you do snoop all over the place you had no right you had no right to go through anything william starks beat thanks what for whatre those youre just gon na walk yeah but i like it i guess jackie yeah but i dont know what our car wont start come on mom dont fall asleep because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups i dont understand how just a little when we were looking up information about williams father how did he helpwhere beat its becker isnt it hes doing stuff isnt he what should they be looking for its the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about i wish theyd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we dont have i see youve done your homework beat alpine groves undergone a lot of changes since then at the time we didnt have theresources to help our patients the way we needed to beat now we do and things are different i still dont either even after all these years he just saidthat id shock eugene and then things would change for him its complicated but looking at starks in a way your father let me know how id get through to him sure its an easy address a little far out there but easy enough what are you talking about who told you this william i cant indulge these delusions even when youre in this state i do believe you im not gon na let that happen what for youre going to be ok william we just need to get your fever down and well be able to hopefully stabilize you you have nothing to fear william yeah you told me this was how it happened i know i know it all save your strength i already know everything youre going to say beat youre in the jacket right now arent you i dont know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions how do you know about eugene william that is just another facet of my delusions and how do you know that why not why dont you help me beat like who like mackenzie maybe what about the world the future doesnt look different ok fine tell me about it tell me about the future 2004 what does it look like well what time is it then help me understand you know youre not alone a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms what you have might well be a syndrome and if so its not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously no i do thats what im saying to you what do you mean youll die if you keep smoking those in your condition well beat let me know how your search turns out its important for you to know who your father was isnt it so maybe dr becker would know beat but as im sure you know the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities how do you know about dr becker i was but i saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows im sorry i dont know more about your fathers sincerely i didnt know about everything that went on here i was working with a boy named eugene at the end he made me change my mind about a lot of things yeah i did beat he was my most memorable patient my god you look exactly like him you should be careful you could be killed if they found you out here so its helping you may never remember at all beat your minds grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged you were convicted of the crime youre not crazy i guess id ask you whyyeah me too softly every day for the last ten years she fucked herself up day after day and then one day she fell asleep with a burning cigarette beat i came home from work and she was gone never knew my father i grew up with my mother actually i grew up around my mother she was great though i mean the way she was with her friends she was this woman who had so much life in her she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us beat she died young im sorry so you never knew your mother may be easy to remember but not easy to get being warm maybe but look you dont even have a coat and i still have to chop wood to make a fire beat and being happyyou tell me if thats simple you remember it maybe beat maybe not beat real is overrated well good for you shit happens and your life changes bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen beat so how come you

well dont you somewhere stuff belongings do you have a motel or something money well howd you get here because in my life it wouldnt make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where hes

you care what i do with whom if im sleeping with him and i havent said i am then so what no ones waiting home hes a very sweet man do you think he can do it sort of sometimes youre not building an obsession about steven are you look i understand opening night jitters but youve got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy no friends no phone is what true the fact is i have to get going he doesnt want to meet some outof work ingenue peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously i hear good things about the new play i was one of those silent listening children glued to the shadows alla puttanesca what a little drastic maybe engaging he has something a funny little quality i find a little not one of stevens finer moments i think i remember i was in the fishmarket play what happened to him we have a very nice pasta today alla putanesca im going home to my machine i dont want you steven yes ive seen your victims

hard for you to believe in something its hard to have faith its hard nwork to trust somebody it may be work but its not honest work faith is the real work your problem is you take the easy way out losing is easy its a simple subject and the people he hurts the most are the people who love him despite who he is and what he does for a living were always saying we want to take control of our lives
