failure of nerve we took the seediest most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care paid out millions for it put the same old duffers in charge a new broom with very old bristles when the tories were returned i went and sat in the bm and wrote my little book on chartism did he i left school and worked for the labour party my older brother george had just been killed in greece and hed been an active member i heroworshipped him he was 25 years old it was an exciting time for us those first couple of years after the war we thought the country was about to become a true democracy i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time they feel betrayed they want to know what went wrong then i began to listen to what the welloff were saying about the poor now ï½ the war had just ended and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act a small minority thought that england was really theirs they had made it they owned it the rest the wage earners were foreigners outsiders intent on wrecking it all shall we go hello anyone for a walk tom isnt i can tell you these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts including

even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia its a pity she couldnt make it up here today i do worry about susan have you known her long she hasnt mentioned you i think youll do very well if you like but dont be too modest james the citizens duty is to remember not necessarily to write books you are highly qualified youre a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you here i am lecturing you have some pï½tï½ if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost everyone must have a memory everyone needs to be a historian in this country for example were in danger of losing hardwon freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present to james i remember what it was i was going to say we were talking about forgetfulness the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting and id like you to call me ann since you are a friend of my daughters i think im entitled to call you james dont you think my husband apologises for not joining us its not too cold for you mr penfield good suez was a minefield for both parties i see are you a socialist mr penfield it wasnt much more than a pot boilersuez was very important for our generation i didnt want it to be forgotten and thats why id like to be able to help you but really mr penfield i looked through my notes before you came theyre all very much out of date theres been so much published since i dont think im your man my first husband worked for the bbc i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbcs independence during the suez crisis one of the few things he was passionate about i became involved too i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez then he died and i loots the will to write it by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it wasnt worth going on hes a little unhappy i hope he wasnt a nuisance tom daddy would like to see you in the garden and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee and remember to say please mr penfield i am sorry to have kept youi know im sorry oh excuse me theres nicholas in your car hes making plans for brighton he thought we could travel down together jeremy phoned this morning yes might remember youre here to talk to my mother i might no its a bit of a madhouse for some reason a lot of my mothers friends specialise in monologues well you should do you think shes invited you up for her sake or for mine did she talk about me i think were ready now thank you and how was norfolk did you get on with my mother you just might i bet thanks for the drink i dont trust anyone thats what comes of working in television two or three years ago i would have stayed and fucked you i have to be up early yes if you like call me at work well you know i called you a taxi damn theyre early that must be rather nice in a way i mean you dont have any it makes me weepy just to remember it so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew whos a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials what about yours mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious i really was upset i stopped going home i never phoned i went round telling everyone how awful her books were and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters yes youre much too old to making a drama out of alienation or whatever you call it youve got to take responsibility for your own happiness thats what i think anyway i think youre exaggerating and if you arent you should jolly well change your job and youre at this third stage my real father well he was a flashback good theory but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does and the shape of it all it was sort ofshapeless and i didnt like that man i think it went on rather too long i quite liked it i wasnt as enthusiastic as everyone else no its all right i can get a cab night night yes thats right im being terribly rude bob oh bob this is bob tuckett bon was at oxford too was that your chapter then it was very good so its all worked out perfectly no he wasnt he just lowered himself into a bar stool and said oo i do feel bad i ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees its true i was here last

round me like children saying you working for television youre just a young thing they wouldnt let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying oo can i it was incredible he came back made a pompous little bow and said my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish and hes promised not to talk to the press promise oh yes wheres mine i want to look like you what have you got there dont point it at james oh no it was last year were thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools world history
