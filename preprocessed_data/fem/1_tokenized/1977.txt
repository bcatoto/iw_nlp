our benefit and i apologize i misunderstood you you knew them why didnt you bury those people i will not i have seen the face of war before mr poe but never war made on women and children and almost as cruel is your indifference though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a christian burial yes i do i know exactly what i am saying and if it is sedition then i am guilty of sedition too justice if thats justice then the sooner french guns blow the english army out of america the better it will be for these people he knew the consequences and he stayed are those the actions of a criminal duncan do something there was no letter there was none when how what are they doing to duncan duncan yes go ahead they do not live their lives by your leave they hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands burying their dead and their children along the way you know he wouldnt send me you misrepresented what you saw and caused this i too was at that farm it was as he said beyond the periphery of men staring at him i am sorry duncan duncan duncan i promised you an answer you have complimented me with your persistence and patience but the decision ive come to is id rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment he delivered no such message my god alice yes yes i will cousin eugenie my father but some say thats the way of it dear duncan my affection is as towards a closest friend alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely i wish they did but my feelings dont go beyond that do you see you still have an aversion to the water im embarrassed to be so indecisive after so long apart and after youve traveled so far
