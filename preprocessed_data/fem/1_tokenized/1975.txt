old fool roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty what sacrifice do you want from me i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself i did not know that one kiss could matter so much without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it my husband has convinced me of the contrary our abstinence makes our love immortal if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires always my dear one never any further love is a child to be pacified with trifles a full diet can only kill it poor man and for that reason you want to begin where people end you will do as you please it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other do you not agree and if she does not choose to show you some kindness be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me to make me wretched in two weeks you want my heart how so a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws it is only too possible love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune your word empty makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate if it is fortunate i congratulate myself if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it many worthy of attention but valuing is something more i could value only someone whom i loved that man has perhaps not yet been born not one not even that never noyou must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver thats very kind of you mr ohiggins but i shouldnt like to put you to such trouble mister that fool didnt know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this
