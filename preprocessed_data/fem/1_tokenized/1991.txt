goodnight to daddy come on now well talk about it at the table dinners getting cold what are you doing in here jim dinners just about ready ive got a surprise for you tried something new jim jim dinneror a cover up jesus bill dont you have enough proof of the fbis complicity now no shaw director of the trade mart this is incredible who you want facts bill okay from 1945 to 59 only two us soldiers defect to russia from 59 to 60 seven defect six return one of them another marine a month before oswald all of them young men made to seem poor disenchanted i dont know if its coincidence but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan six months after he arrives in russia francis gary powers u2 spy flight goes down in russia that plane was untouchable powers hinted that oswald couldve given the russians enough data to hit it as a direct result the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed i cant help thinking of that book seven days in may maybe someone in our military didnt want the peace conference to happen maybe oswald was part of that it gets weirder yes but were talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance three years later and hes still classified they gave us his grammar school records a study of his pubic hairs put it in context bill of what we know about oswald lonely kid no father unstable childhood high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy joins the marines at 17 he learns russian he acts overtly marxist with two other marines but hes stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate hes discharged from the marines supposedly because his mothers sick he stays home 3 days then with a 1500 ticket from a 203 bank account he goes to moscow im sorry arent you being a little hard this is interesting are you ready for this oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald bugging the district attorneys office of new orleans its outrageous now it gets positively spooky in january 1961 in new orleans at the bolton ford dealership when the oswald we know is in russia there is a man using the name oswald to buy trucks for the friends of democratic cuba the salesman never saw him again but guess whos on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba guy banister banister has someone using the name oswald to buy the trucks hoover at the fbi writes a memo dated june 1960 that there could be someone using oswalds passport and identity all i can find out about the williams is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program he used slave labor to build the v2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams its through janet williams in october 63 that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists the next thing we know hes living in dallasft worth in october 62 working 6 months at jaggarschiles stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the us army he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man whod been in the army security agency none either its bizarre its next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in 63 a man who has defected once already its crazy spas t raikin a leading member of an anticommunist group the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type none the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel hes never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or as far as we know debriefed by the cia but he never writes speaks or does any propaganda for the russians he meets marina whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence at a trade union dance she thinks hes russian the way he speaks six weeks later they marry have a daughter finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has hes given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls negative on his tax records classified first time i know a da cant get a tax record i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them there are about 1200 documents oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u2 a cia 201 personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and activities cant get one of them all classified as secret on the grounds of national security its real strangei keep thinking of that day tuesday the 26th the day after they buried kennedy lbj was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge it never did i knew the man 20 years thats him the way he walked arms at his side military the stoop the haircut the twisted left hand the large class ring what was he doing there if anyone had asked him hed probably say protection but ill tell you i think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes theyre about to get booked and hes telling em its gon na be okay theyre covered and in fact they were you never heard of them again does it matter another technician but an interesting thing he was there that day in dealey plaza you know how i know that picture of yours the hoboes you never looked deep enough you never ask a spook a question no point hell never give you a straight answer general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket dont think so when they start to drool they get rid of em these guys are proud of what they did they did dealey plaza they took out the president of the united states thats entertainment and they served their country doing it hes done it before other countries lumumba in the congo trujillo the dominican republic hes working on castro no big deal in september kennedy announces the texas trip at that moment second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket y flies in the assassins maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens greece pros maybe some locals cubans maria hire separate teams does it really matter who shot from what rooftop part of the scenery the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone i think it started in the wind money arms big oil pentagon people contractors bankers politicians like lbj were committed to a war in southeast asia as early as 61 they knew kennedy was going to change things he was not going to war in southeast asia who knows probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere houston new york hell maybe bonn germany who knows its international now you didnt get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba what can i do for you but you dont have a choice anymore youve become a significant threat to the national security structure they wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you instead theyre gon na destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town youre some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm you got ta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba i hope you get a break no chance in hell mr garrison id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized maybe worse you too i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things keep digging yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy thats important its historic kings are killed mr garrison politics is power nothing more but dont believe me dont trust me do your own work your own thinking im not with the agency mr garrison and i assume

wrestler and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end in between the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type or a convict and sometimes instead of a waif hed have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild the studio always hated that oh some of the scripts were so spirited yes im afraid i have its alright barton you dont have to write actual scenes oh hes he drifted off hell sleep for a while now what is it you have to do exactly now thats all right barton everythingll be all right hello barton if i can he gets jealous he who is this hello barton empathy requires understanding hell wander back when hes sober and apologize he always does no sometimes he just well he thinks about estelle his wife still

really works ya know oh sure got ta believe in god but i dont think god made man in his own image no cause most of the bullshit that happens is because of men no i think man was made out of the devils image and women were created out of god because women can have babies which is sorta like creating and which also explains why women are attracted to men because lets face it the devil is a helluva lot more interesting i slept with a few saints and let me tell you booooorring and so the whole point of life i think is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and ya

for what were about to do you dont have to say that no reallybelieve me there isnt any more this is it there isnt any more to tell what do you do for a living i mean how do you know him we mostly publish trashy romance novels why does it sound exciting theres absolutely nothing exciting about it iuhi get to read some of the books but mostly ijust calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback after paperback its basically someone elses problem what a gyp got any ethel merman i dont like uh polish love stories i like musicals i dont like horror movies ohlike moses parry parryguards come exactly every three minutes gum it doesnt have to be everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin youll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails that was beautiful hudson gods given you a gift for cat burglary you can t just something like that oh thank god youre dead i know i know your eminence just say god go with me im going to find out you got it operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and im the punchline i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower a little petting is not the issue he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure but he knew right and wrong oh and we kind of messed around i betrayed a man a good man an innocent man a thief yeah the big e thats the best kind a wise woman once said polite conversation is rarely either no your eminence i think hes going to steal the codex as early as next week hudson im afraid im sticking with god but youre a close second tough guy what is that smile holy shhthings are going to get very interesting very fast da vinci would be proud of you wha you dont want to know da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded the way the machine is running now the gold will produce too quickly clog and the machine will shut itself down isnt it wonderful trust leonardo oh hudson im a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent oh hudson uh yeah guess im a wee bit nervous im sorry i could only score clergy passports you re not some guy anymore hudson right now youre the only guy without your help i its that kind of selfish attitude that its from the machine all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 23 of it already we cant let that happen where did you get this iworkforacovertvaticanhumanitarian organization theciamadeafoolofme icareforyou hudson dont you understand oh i must have put too much ethylchloride in it the ci what god no for two years ive been tracking the mayflowers peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces their sforza replica was as fake as the gas leak that supposedly destroyed it what are your plans for the weekend hoisting away the colosseum tell me did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower you really went and did it with one day not even a day of planning you did it nobody does it better hudson you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex somebody robbed the vatican its also been a long time for me i im sorry i cant i oh im so sorry what have you been doing wow you were in the joint doing hard time its funny but that excites me i seem to have a thing for sinners how long were you in prison oh hudson i was worried you werent going to drop by secret passageways dont mean as much as they used to theres a place two blocks east of here enzos say 1030 ill bring my entire repertoire i dont steal stuffed elephants from little girls and i buy my own clothes my lifes a little boring actually i wrote it its a good sentence it can apply to people nice but right out of our brochure delivers up to ten at night the pope has an obsession with his easter seals its actually not that an unusual setup the secret passageway on the other hand sure hudson are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo come on this stuff will knock you out have you ever had the feeling you were being followed mr bond question sir his untiring pen predicted the airplane the submarine the bicycle the helicopter and even the tank as you know the da vinci codex has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more tough guy what are youhows your head thanks tough guy thanks a lot why was the guard chasing you no i meant you didnt have to tackle me and rip my dress a polite push perhaps a clear shout of watch out anna would have done nicely my god that was bold of you you didnt have to do that fantastic perfection the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder cat got his tongue oh lord the only reason i ask is that hudson uh mr hawk hawkins had some neat things to say about darwin minerva and you basically that youre part of the same car pool when the mayflowers find out we have the codex theyre going to want to make a dealyoure detestable youre just doing your job not today burgel send one of your memos write up one of your communiques but for gods sake dont bother me today say what you like no one pays the least attention i do always you understand the world better than any of us kafka and what its becoming ive always held you in the highest regard i know better than you what people will say when they have to when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day i think youve just escaped for the moment just as i did as eduard did as they let us do but only for the moment why should i believe a man who never believed me theyre absolutely right you know guilt should never be doubted its easier that way i know there is and youre what i have to bargain with for now youre the last one in their way i know how they reward failure if they saw this id be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others this is the result of their elixir of youth they were to come and check on it during the night i contrived to miss the appointment only two steps back even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists why i became a murderer because murder is bliss its easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil once youve adopted its procedure over its only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit i knew you walked this way to work i wanted to find you before they did what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails youre far from understanding the authorities if you believe that or what if there really was an error i dont know what kind any kind that needed correcting and what if burgel was responsible for it one mistake even a small one in a firm like ours it could cost him a promotion and burgel is the bringer of messages isnt he how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records of course he is the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark people disappear up there regularly if you want to lie in wait for someone thats the place to do it he used to like me very much more than i liked him burgel hated eduard and me im sure he knew about us and im sure it drove him mad its still easier for you to understand suicide isnt it you might think i thought so myself at first that burgels too insignificant to be dangerous but thats the very reason to beware its the small men to watch out for the ones who substitute method for character i wouldnt put it past him of course it could burgels been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember he couldve killed eduard theyre not obliged to tell burgel i didnt leave it with him im collecting eduards things if theres anything you want take it or ill give it to charity yes which is why quiet dependable people have to take charge of their own lives you think what were doing is so wrong and what are you doing pursuing goodness for what to answer to some supreme tribunal when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day its liable to create a false impression youre shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window he was murdered he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division apparently one of his claims was relevant the day he died eduard was called up to the castle did you know that you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of your fellow men and yet youre able to remain an outsider with the concomitant air of superiority i nominated you as a possible candidate you were eduards good friend he read me some of your work theyre ubiquitous what we try to do is make them a little less so you wont have any trouble finding it im suspicious of men who want to marry i believe they think its the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers eduard wanted to marry me you almost married recently didnt you there are some people id like you to meet can you come to the musil district at eight oclock are you free tonight the very fact that theyre authorities should give you reason people will do anything to protect their own interests for all you know he was killed at the hands of the police and you believe everything the authorities tell you do you think people in the new town care what happens over here this will always be the ghetto eduard didnt see it as something that needed bearing two or three months thats all i seduced him as long as its on their terms if your work and your private life dont correspond to their specifications youre labelled a dangerous agitator with no recourse whatsoever whats funny its not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office what he would have you were his best friend a better friend than me i was having an affair with eduard he didnt tell you yes have you looked hello again excuse me i have to copy this for central docketing by 230 one of you must be mistaken why would you suppose so i knowagent mapp thank you he knew her every day but why he didnt weight the others fredrica bimmel from belvedere ohio the first girl taken but the third body found why what girl but there is no pattern theres no connection at all among these places or the computers wouldve nailed it theyre even found in random order desperately random what does he mean hes here ardelia the worst part the thing thats making me crazy is that bill is right in front of me only i cant see him lecter said everything i need to catch him is right here in these pages it would be rude and he wouldnt get to ask any more questions no he wont come after me somebodys coaching her theyre trying to make him see catherine as a person not just an object boy is that smart pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face thanks ardelia whatd i do never cock just squeeze i will i promise sometimes ill need the big fingerprint kit and the onetoone polaroid the cu 5 with film packs and batteries where shut up the other officers will be here any minute youre perfectly safe now catherine listen to me i have to find a rope i have to leave this room just for a minute but ill get you out just be quiet so i can hear shut that dog up is there a ladder is there a rope youre all right where is he fbi catherine youre safe dr chilton i told you this is just routine followup on the raspail case but then i wouldve missed the pleasure of your company dr chilton if lecter feels youre his enemy as youve said then maybe ill have more luck by myself what do you think i understand i graduated magna from uva doctor its not a charm school how do you mean dr chilton im sure its a great town dr chilton but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon but then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them thats what lecter was hinting maybe he lives in this this belvedere ohio too maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously maybe he just meant to give her a 7up and talk about the choir but then yes sir i can find it by myself sir doesnt this william rubin strike you as i dont know kind of vague mr krendler dr lecter trusts me or at least he used to if i could just i need the id to fly with my gun the gun belongs in quantico sir mr crawford instructed me not yet just wait for me maybe in about two seconds mr yow oh mr yow it looks like somebody is sitting in this car that wasnt me okay mr yow good idea mr yow if this door should fall down ha ha or anything else would you be kind enough to call this number its our baltimore field office they know youre here with me do you understand i wont disturb anything mr yow i promise be gone before you know it did she leave any records here tax or business records maybe a list of employees mr gordon did you take over this place after mrs lippman died i think we may be yes thanks mr gordon did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs lippman im investigating the death of fredrica bimmel who are you please excuse me but i really do need to talk to you this was mrs lippmans house did you know her yes sir thank you sir yes sir ill do my best chicagos only about 400 miles from here i could be there in sewing sir thats great news but how where thats why theyre all so big because he needs a lot of skin he keeps them alive to starve them awhile to loosen their skin so that hes making himself a woman suit mr crawford out of real women and he can sew this guy hes really skilled a dressmaker or a tailor hes going to kill her mr crawford this morning or maybe at noon but today and belvederes our last chance im flying there right now unless you stop me you want my id here take it but i just became a private citizen i can go anywhere i want to but not from this angle not thinking he knew her youve got to send me you do until six pm all his victims are women his obsession is women he lives to hunt women but not one women is hunting him except me i can walk in a womans room and know three times as much about her as a man would i have to go to belvedere mr crawford can those cops down there handle dr lecter i lied to lecter ill need some kind of peace offering can i get the drawings from his cell lecter is still the key i know he is whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before if you didnt want me chasing him you shouldnt have taken me to that funeral home are you in trouble over this mr crawford can senator martin do something to you chilton has killed her hasnt he that slimy little bastard we were so close with lecter and now her last chance is gone youll back me up with some paperwork then ill try but wouldnt this have more weight coming from the senator herself transfer to a new prison with a view of trees he said or even water can we swing that i think he means it this time i think hell deal but if he knew we have so little time hes already offered to help what would happen if we just showed our cards asked him for bill raspail was killed by the same man whos killing these girls and lecter knows him maybe even treated him you think so too dont you or youd never have sent me to that asylum then have the lab check raspails head dr lecters patient have them probe his softpalette tissues theyll find another cocoon im wondering if hes done that before placed a cocoon or an insect it would be easy to miss in an autopsy especially with a floater can we check back on that it matters mr crawford other cops know who you are they look at you to see how to act it matters i dont know i didnt see those on any of the other girls well shes not local her ears are pierced three times each and shes wearing green glitter nail polish looks like town to me he starts this buzzing in me in my head he makes me feel violated you used me mr crawford you knew you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this but you werent up front with me you sent me in to him naked you havent said a word today about that garage or what i found there like i have a knack for dr lecter hes got a real taste for it now and hes getting better at his work what he does with them takes privacy time tools hes in his 30s or 40s hes got real physical strength but combined with an older mans selfcontrol hes cautious precise never impulsive this wont end in suicide like they often do hes a white male serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group and hes not a drifter hes got his own house somewhere not an apartment theres no correlation at all between where theyre kidnapped and where theyre found what if what if you trace the heaviesttraffic routes backwards from the dump sites do they converge at all im here sir i just i dont know how to feel about it murdered how sir what is it theres something youre not telling me to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday but sir sir thats a field job its outside the scope of my assignment and ive got a test tomorrow on i spent all evening on the mainframe lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories prior to capture no record of anyone named mofet but split city sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce i tracked it down in the librarys catalogue of national yellow pages its a ministorage facility outside baltimore where lecter had his practice right down to the kleenex i used sir why is something wrong its all there sir practically verbatim and what is that sir yes sir yes well okay right im glad for the chance sir but why me whos the subject not yet i hope so they havent posted anything good morning mr crawford dr lecter and theres no way no natural way these couldve wound up in the bodies not lately but maybe someday i try to be a student dr pilcher sometimes you do i think so where does mrs lippman live id like to talk to her did you ever work with her stacy did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb or john grant do you think she couldve had a friend you didnt know about you know i cant make that promise dr lecter starling yes ill tell you tell me his name dr lecter yes i dont know i dont know yes i didnt get more than a few miles before the sheriffs car found me the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman i never saw the ranch again i dont know i had no food or water it was very cold i thought if i can even save just one but he got so heavy so heavy i took one lamb and i ran away as fast as i could no first i tried to free them i opened the gate of their pen but they wouldnt run they just stood there confused they wouldnt run yes they were screaming got dressed without turning on the light i went downstairs outside i heard a strange sound early still dark and one morning i just ran away later listen ill dr lecter when theres time ill all right then tell me how no we just anger social resentment sexual frus he kills w then tell me how i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore or starting to tell me the rest now dr lecter you find out everything you couldnt have talked with this william rubin even once and come out knowing so little about him you made him up didnt you nobody sent me i came on my own i thought you might want your drawings back just until you get your view yes doctor please how would he test on what basis would they reject him you said i was very close to the way wed catch him no quid pro quo doctor no i ran away two months horses and sheep i went to live with my mothers cousin and her husband in montana they had a ranch no tell me why dr lecter theres no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence transsexuals are very passive quid pro quo doctor no he was strong he lasted almost a month my mother died when i was very young so my father had become the whole world to

you make me sick wasnt daddy wonderful he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her but he didnt because he loves mother and all of us and he loves rose too isnt he wonderful isnt he great buddy that was pretty snotty of you pushing me away like that just when it was interesting buddy that was my place he had his hand on her titty he kissed her buddy this is amazing you wouldnt believe it wow

dumb sometimes shes watching the car again i think daddy suspects no oh shut up buddy i dont know i think hes cryin im only trying to help him mother daddy buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it he took the lords name in vain then claimed he hadnt said it he lied daddy mother buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit and he says i would too if i was grownup is it true mother would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says i dont like that either its worse than waski i want to be called frani said she isnt here now you go home be a nice boy and go home she isnt here and im sorry but mr hillyer doesnt want her to have callers during working hours she must have gone out for a walk with the children yes this isnt punishment i dont believe in punishment its for your health obviously youre sick if you can act like that i dont think you are sufficiently in awe of it get the castor oil but we must respect that power we must be in awe of it sex isnt ugly sex is one of the most beautiful things in life the creative power of the universe is behind it now i have a plan about rose an educational plan shes getting better and we dont want any more trouble brother you ought to hear this i do wish youd speak to brother its true hes been looking at those horrible little books again oh yes its thursday hello rose dear my youre looking pretty whatd you say brother children children be quiet all of you the vibrations in this house are strange today wheres rose anyhow no you didnt say that brother what did you say brother stop gagging like that and putting on a show and swallow it this is for your own good when you look at negative destructive things like those little filthy comic books you are sick here take this oh brother i am so disappointed in you you mustnt look at those horrible things they degrade the human image brother when i have to wake you up at eleven oclock in the morning youre either sick or you were up very late last night and you werent reading huckleberry finn i looked and its not in your room now what were you doing walked in all that heat its a wonder she hasnt got sunstroke ill phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski all right all right doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap you go get them and bring them down to the living room where is the girl your impression is very reassuring brother of course shes had troubles poor thing but i sensed that was that the girl was like and im glad to have it reconfirmed wonderful whats she like brother what is your impression of her yes i think so he adores her its almost pitiful the way he worships her i just hope she isnt too much for him well yes shes happy of course dave doesnt have her life force not at all there isnt much furniture in his house just a table and one or two chairs whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows who i dont understand it even in the wild days she was never as late as this how is she better off how could she ever find love and happiness if you did what youre talking about are you insane rose isnt oversexed thats ridiculous if youre going to talk nonsense i dont want to talk to you at all rose is exactly the same as the rest of us except more so i cant believe you really meant it if i did id want to die you arent a male monster that man is but you arent look me in the eye and tell me do you really want to take roses womanhood away from her when its all she has got i thought i knew you i thought i knew you better i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man well i cant believe what ive just heard in this room a defenseless girl depending on you for protection and you propose to mutilate and destroy her how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man over my dead body this conversation is making me a little sick id say about three months are you satisfied honey what did you forget but she must know unless unless rose was there more than one person thats why im asking her who the father is its the most vital question of all whos the father dear poor thing dont cry rose i know you feel awful but dont cry honey nobodys perfect whos the father dear it sounds like a farm to me calling it a dairy establishment thats just trickery and flummery i dont know how you can call it ideal dont you know what the word farm means to her honey rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life now i dont think shes just nervous and worried and you would be too if you had no job and no place to go she does look a little peaky she cant get a job its a depression and we cant just throw her out on the street she hasnt actually done anything shes like a different person being so sick made a big impression on her i really think shes learned a lesson sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit your real trouble is that youre antiintellectual the irony is women are supposed to be emotional but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do honey dr martinson isnt a rascal hes one of the finest physicians in glenville he studied at johns hopkins university i dont see how you can even think of it now you dont like him because hes a yankee hes a brilliant doctor honey please ill talk to her ill reason with her what she doesnt understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people shes young shes got to learn to restrain the life force thats in her its creative but in her case its too creative if you mean sex you couldnt be more wrong rose likes those boys and men she has love in her heart and that is what they want its the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly she has a loving nature you ought to want someone like that around your children why do you think those boys and men like her but what i said is the simple truth and now i see something else i see more deeply into it but morals come from the heart not from rigid rules and empty laws and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would therefore shes not immoral not really who is to say our morals are better than hers but maybe youre right she could influence dolly well she does seem to cause a lot of trouble i admit but she doesnt mean any harm and itll break the childrens hearts they all love her well thats very reasonable howe i hate to bring it up but shes got an awful toothache weve got to carry her to the dentist it isnt her fault if shes popular what just a moment you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends not while there is breath in my body and when i try to talk to you seriously when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts what do you do you mock me yes yes i say that to you they were boys boy friends of rose chats what they were and why shouldnt she have boy friends do you want her to be unnatural dont you think shes human the same way you are yourself its the south thats what it is the south with its horrible traditions of slavery and crime and the oppression of women who are just as good as men and just as human scoundrels they werent scoundrels they were just boys you certainly are she has an awful toothache look at her jaw its all swollen i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl well it isnt roses fault boys and men like her you cant blame her for that hon that sulky boy was here again this afternoon i was almost scared he wouldnt go away well time will tell wont it well i wish youd stop criticizing and picking on her why shouldnt she go out and have boyfriends is she all right what time is it be kind to her she loves you so much in a perfectly proper way of course but thats a wonderful quality not a bad quality have a little patience with her shes such a goodhearted little thing and tries so hard he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children i dont think you understand her it isnt sex she wants its love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it well i admit that outfit isnt very modest but she doesnt mean any harm she just wants to attract attention i wish you wouldnt pick on rose and tease her like that of course her clothes are silly but shes ignorant naive she doesnt know any better rose you and brother wait in the car i want to speak for a moment lo mr hillyer youre not having lunch well it is a little tight but it isnt as bad as all that no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place im serious we forget hes just a child i wish youd speak to him why they wont either she looks pretty and i wish you wouldnt pick on the poor girl all the time dont listen to him rose you look pretty even beautiful whats the matter hon is anything wrong i think about what im doing all the time and ive got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody besides i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes the poor girl isnt feeling well be nice to rose shes never had a real home im not in the fourth dimension you are in the fourth dimension when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control as blake said if god had doubt the sun would go out hotcha character if i had to live with your cynicism i wouldnt want to live at all what you cant understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive not negative hope for the best i dont understand all this skepticism i thought you liked rose there are no flies on rose i dont know what youre talking about and shes such a goodhearted thing there isnt an ounce of harm or malice in her honey shes perfect she works all the time and shes wonderful with the children and they love her even brother likes her though he wont admit it i think shes just perfect oh did you say something what slow hon but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here yes its so nice i thought id work outside it isnt the fourth dimension to you its the fourth dimension maybe to me its simply the truth whats the matter with him you mustnt be a tattletale dear you mustnt be delilahish and jezebelish toward your brother dear yes dear what is it daddy wouldnt hear that now the redhaired boy you see sitting there of course you have met him he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child all children have great creative powers but i dont want to rattle on about my children they say i brag too much about them especially about brother am i boring you rose let him be guided not by my wishes and not by roses wishes although i am sure they are identical let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself because that is what has spoken through me tonight i understand you perfectly you leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry i will not cry like a woman if im upset its because of what my husband said not because of you you cant make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and selfcontrol as a man and you get this in your head if you hurt that girl ill hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got ill do my level best to ruin you do you understand me youd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself youd go that far dont you think i know what youve just said and dont you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime youve just conspired to commit are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters is there no limit to which you wont go to keep your illusions about yourselves what are you talking about i dont understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces yes go on what do you mean what kind of gobbledygook talk is that no you shouldnt have it was needlessly cruel she thinks she has cancer and is going to die well thats pathetic poor rose what a life she has had gonorrhea yes well shes upstairs oh good evening doctor rose is a lot better i just gave her her supper shes almost all well now yes thank you doctor it is kind of amazing the dentist says she has perfect teeth there isnt a cavity in her mouth well her people were very poor she says she was often hungry as a child and im sure the food she ate was pretty awful not a balanced diet at all deathly afraid of it her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesnt know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals she hid it from us doctor shes afraid of the hospital she looks terrible just awful that would scare her to death shes terrified of hospitals to her a hospital is where you go to die but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled she was raised on a poor dirt farm im sure shes never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor no waski she wont die because we are praying for her there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair beauty is beauty and thats all there is to it beauty is there and we have to recognize it now rose the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby she looks like an angel and she is an angel but she can be a naughty angel sometimes although her father wont believe it her real name is frances but we call her dolly or doll when he was baby we called him wa wa a baby name you know you will find him a very good boy his brother can be bad and so can his sister but waski is a very good boy and as you can see hes beautiful rose this is waski his real name is warren but we call him waski he doesnt like it much and i suppose someday well have to stop calling him that well well thats wonderful rose forget about it i dont want you working in one of those honky tonks dont worry honey youll find something rose you dont have to rose really you shouldnt act like that i know its embarrassing but who were you exposed to dear rose well now mrs hillyer i ahh thats kinda hard to say rose you dont look well and you havent eaten a bit of breakfast well theres no reason you shouldnt go out rose in moderation you look very pretty in it rose really you do you see rose now thats the kind of dress you ought to wear rose youre very sick youre burning up rose can you hear me rose rose has learned her lesson havent you rose itll get better now i know it was bad honey im sorry rose sit down in that chair and be quiet were trying to help you you silly creature sit in that chair no rose hell help you poor thing does the ice help rose be quiet rose i dont think we ought to discuss this in front of the children i had better call daddy rose that scruffylooking man is out in the yard again doll you and waski run on too well i think its charming rose but dont you think ah the skirt is a little tight you look sick if you ask me i hate to leave you with the dishes and all but im supposed to go to a meeting of the garden club this evening ill need the car keys rose youre in an awful dither tonight whats the matter with you honey are you sick or something well you run on now really why dont you go sit down somewhere rose you work too hard why dont you go sit down somewhere and drink a cocola well i am working on my thesis more history rose well its rather interesting about brother actually i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old he looked at me and understood me he knew exactly who i was i know it sounds crazy but its true hes very remarkable he was born for the ministry and could move millions but he doesnt know that yet i have to warn you about him he can be very dangerous there is an evil streak in him a streak of pure sheer meanness but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesnt know itbuddy sex dont mean a thing to me it aint nothin but a mosquito bite ill tell you a secret girls dont want sex buddy girls want love a saint just like your own mother shes up in heaven right now her and lunette there aint no doubt about it boy did i get sick of rabbit but later on after momma died and daddy wasnt doin nothin but drinkin i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew you know i oughtnt to of told
