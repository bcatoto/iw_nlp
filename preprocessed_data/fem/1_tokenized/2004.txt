is this really happening because youre afraid i should kill you if its true you should die i should kill you now youre a liar youre a liar how how can how can you be here and say this you killed them then what yes what no i do its nothing its just a picture okay i speak englishjason you know exactly what to do that is your mission now you do it wouldnt have changed the way you feel but you found another choice i love you too jason please dont do thisit wont ever be over like this there must be another way what if its not who you think it is where are you going hang on its just him jesus is he back there where what wheres left to go i dont want to move again i like it here but youre not youre not sure where thats crazy so but youre sure but we were so careful no how one day it will be different it just takes time well make new memories you and me you are better and i think its not memories at all its just a dream you keep having over and over sleep sleep now i dont mean that i worry when you try to ignore it i worry when you get like this we write them down because sooner or later youre going to remember something good it hasnt been two years youre sure we should still we should write it down ill get the book where were you jason in the carits not in the file i swear i know your file your first job was geneva i swear to god you never worked here no jason please you never worked berlin your first assignment was geneva no you never worked berlin what do you mean he closed down treadstone he took care of me after paris please im only here because of paris because they cant figure out what youre doing im here because of abbott conklin stuff on conklin you left a print there was kel that didnt go off there was a partial print they tracked it back to treadstone they know its you and you got to him before we could it was pamela landys op the guy was going to sellout a mole or something i havent been debriefed on exactly what it was last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national what is this a game they know they know you were here they know you killed these two guys they know you and conklin had something on the side they dont know what it is but they know you hear me i believed you i did jason i swear i did i told them i told them i believed you yes so i dont know he was sick he wanted out i believed him its got caffeine in it thats all i know because hes doing just what he said hed do hes coming for us i dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway what do you want from me i was reassigned im out these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans you mean did i want a date youre making it out like were friends here or something i met him alone twice if you say so i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him am i a doctor no but good luck before this before bourne no depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light no you lost your way no good options left and danny zorn what was that and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it why would be enough for me id rather stand if its all the same to you im sorry ward dont know did he say anything to you they found danny zorns body dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time sorry to wake you well whatever hes doing ive had enough this is now a search and destroy mission i want the berlin police fully briefed and get this out to all the agencies so whats he doing you believe him dont you want answers hold on he said he wants to come in and you do from the moment he left treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him ive already got a team there i doubt bournes in naples to settle down and raise a family whats definitive is that i just lost two people in berlin may i finish excuse me at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of sevenhundred and sixty thousand dollars this is conklins computer ivan mevedev senior financial manager worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies pecos oil he claimed to know where the money landed we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency this i think i do we had a deal going down in berlin last week during the buy both our field agent and the seller were killed we pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didnt go off they were killed by jason bourne and bourne wheres he now so you had conklin killed i mean if were cutting the crap i want to know what happened lets talk about conklin he does ive been down to the archives i have the files ward i want to know about treadstone thats not gon na fly treadstone why youre alive youre alive because youre special because she kept you alive because we want you back on our side sounds like a threat do you think you can read are you well enough thank you for your gift im sorry about marie are you disappointed careful ramstein air base germany before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital okay jason your move who okay how do you want to do it what do you want bourne what the tapes well know for sure when we get the security tapes this stays between you and i we finally have an edge i dont want to lose it alright take it down i want to look at the room check it out the hotel how far uplink all relevant files to kim and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone then get a number they need to know who theyre dealing with whos going us and the germans cant match it we need to get in there i think that bourne and conklin were in business that bourne is still involved and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever hes been hiding to kill again hows that scan for a thief a mole i vetted the source marty hes real if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects its a bargain at ten times the price were talking raw unprocessed kgb files its not something we can go out and comparison shop thats where we came out felt promising its a start lets give him half an hour alright what do you think is he coming in is it fresh and why is that see thats a problem for me nicky whatever hes doing we need to end it this isnt the kind of mess you walk away from some women like dobermans did you you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death not good enough youre the person who floated this amnesia story ever feel sorry for him for what hed been through so he fooled you believed what are you an expert in amnesia im curious about bourne your interpretation of his condition you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions you were his local contact you were with him the night conklin died youre coming with us amnesia what kind of problems and what about you anything are we hacking or asking alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything thats out there by who yeah thatll workwhat the hell was he doing here are we locked up anything what the hell is a treadstone do we know what this sayswhat thank you for showing it to me first ill ill take care of it can i have the picture what is it im sorry but can it wait til tonight im already late for work no dances just tell me so what did you find evan wake up oh please wake up how soon well he has been pushing me to meet his father but ive been putting it off come on i doubt the answers that simple but hes seven what kind of stress can he have but you must have something to go on and the bad news why what for anything just tell me that evan doesnt have jasons illness not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evans inherited his fathers condition just like jason how did you know that youre acting like your father fix what does that mean for evan cute evan fine youll get them evan but i think its far more important to focus on your case right now i found these the others are still in storage i dont know these things take time i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal hes sure he can get you off on selfdefense so if youre patient and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could i couldnt tell if they were real memories or just phantoms you know he might only have thought he actually remembered them when he was around your age almost exactly your age he said he figured out a trick to remember the past why do you ask please he got straight as without ever touching a book that was the one area where his memory never failed him i cant help it im just so proud of you youve got the highest grades in all of your classes dont try to use your blackouts to get out of this one something mustve happened what set him off now your father may seem sleepy to you but thats just because of his medicine okay honey what were you doing with that great ill see you soon thats why i wanted you to come here evan dr redfield already has a background in memory loss youll be fine dr redfield just wants to give you some tests youll like him good because ive been waiting to see your art projects all week and id feel terrible

what it means to be real i cant believe im crying already he says it takes a long time thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand do you know the velveteen rabbit joely more joel youre a liar i want to know you you dont tell me things joel im an open book i tell you

believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things we like the same writers this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to and hes cute its fucked up joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime exactly i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him yknow and thats where psychic stuff comes in like it just isnt right with him yknow that made me cry but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river it gets frozen this time of year well for the last week anyway hes kind of a kid kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering who wouldnt like that and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart hes the one who gave me that crow photograph i dont either i used to but im through with that yknow if i dont love my body then im just lost you know with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart thats coming round the bend so ive been seeing this guy im nervous you dont need to be nervous around me though i like you do you think im repulsively fat youre very nice god i have to stop saying that youre nervous around me huh like i wanted to talk to you i didnt need any more reason to do it who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist whats the goal joel my goal joel is to just let it flow through me do you know what i mean its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were all taught we should be consistent yknow you love someone thats it forever you choose to do something with your life thats it thats what you do its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing you know and anyway you sell yourself short i can tell theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain i can tell my goal can i tell you my goal i like you thats the thing about my psychic thing i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people my problem is i never trust it but i get it and with you i get that youre a really good guy youre really nice im sorry i yelled at you before about it god im an idiot oh does that make you sad or anxious im always anxious thinking im not living my life to the fullest yknow taking advantage of every possibility just making sure that im not wasting one second of the little time i have its helpful to think theres some order to things youre kind of closed mouthed arent you but i think i am i like to think i am exactly exactly thats exactly my feeling about it its hard to know like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen thats what youre saying right you forget about those times right me neither but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know maybe thats just coincidence right yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it yknow well i go to a psychic and shes always telling me im psychic she should know do you believe in that stuff yknow im sort of psychic drink up young man
