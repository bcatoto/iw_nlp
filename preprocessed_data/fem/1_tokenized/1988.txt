will not be patronized right okay fire a couple in there the pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball and if you discover before a game youre in the wrong nostril its easy to switch the ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril there are two important psychic conduits called the pingala and the ida the pingala starts with the left testicle and ends at the right nostril the right nostril good just do what i say now which nostril are you breathing through good total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous lets play catch what is this i i i stuff you only
