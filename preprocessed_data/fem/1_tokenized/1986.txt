idea yesgo to hell sure mr congeniality let him find his own clues theres a journal article in this somewhere yeah pd says 41 but he barely looks 30 dr kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral the father looked just like richard even had a mark on his cheek some guy named smith was asking about him in church hill i passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank so he isnt a cop district anyway i cant figure out why hes doing it hes been richard taupin at least since 1967 and the guys rich you should see the stuff he has in that shop its in good condition scottish claymore take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and youve got a claymore claymore didnt think it was my buddy over there fine doesnt have a head does he thanks its my birthday there was a count count dusan he would invite the local peasants to his chateau fill them full of wine then slice their bellies so he could reuse it the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me would you remember his name have you spoken to anyone else about this the boy died i dont follow you ive been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies then you didnt know richard later on why no thank you im fine church hill thats pretty close isnt it you owe me besides im cute sos playing choochoo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of yes you have lived forever the inheritance no what is it whats wrong will i see you again what is it you want but youre known so much history ill only read about what is it like being you damn you dont is that a threat you kill with your left hand you and your buddy make a real team dont you exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between what about that family in 31 you killed those other two of bodies thats insane what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction he knows about you thats why smith called you macleod id like you to try who are you just a little crazy my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses i cant stand it but youre different its in your hands a clarity im not even sure why ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article im going to write but its not its you i must be insane leaving work ditching cops all to follow a murderer a very old murderer but a murderer just the same i hope i never get that old its frightening sometimes the way you talk about other peoples lives thats impossible then you must be at least 70 years old youre using your sons name and you are william taupin arent you william taupin seems to have left his mark i dont know any of these ill make a fool of myself its beautiful theres a catch youre supposed to wear 19th century clothing i thought it might be a nice break from all of this its some sort of party the town is throwing well as long as were stuck here no so what now we just wait the estate stuff is pretty straight forward just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat yes you want me to front for you you make it all sound so simple when you finish what then you did kill those men whats all that our cars were seen together in felton theyre calling me an accessory to murder is this what you killed them with maybe youre wrong no i had to talk to you no are you im a historian mr taupin only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face id rather hear yours no im a witness to a murder that seems to put me pretty high on your friends chop list what about me he was innocent i left a man dead in felton but you dont really care do you he called you macleod what will you do now and you who is he dupont circle he tried to kill me last night what the hell is going on why not jesus christ i have friends ive been to church hill i think you do better yet i dont think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place and i think mr smith whoever he is now knows that does carl smith who grave robbers someone beat you good reflexes charming guy basil once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but byzantine its quite rare you know some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years id like to ask you about the claymore very traditional do you play thanks now theres a new topic im just curious

were its been a miracle it has he lasted right through and healed no one in the village has ever seen anything like it ever steven conor didnt die youre a kind man to be sure ah steven it is good to see youyou sent them away without even letting me say goodbye why dont i sorry if i spoke out of turn i dont know about you but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence i mean whales may not have painted the mona lisa or invented the dirt bike but they didnt ravish the land either yeah bob its tearing me apart fine just fine just a couple of kooks you sure you wont change your mind youre not one of those guys from the military are you trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes or some dipshit stuff like that so you were at berkeley i suppose they told you that communicate communicate what you have no right to be here whoever said the human race was logical now if youll follow me ill introduce you to the institutes pride and joy dont worry ill find you see you around the galaxy why does it have to be goodbye youre going to your ship im going to mine science vessel ive got 300 years of catchup learning to do i belong here suppose by some miracle you do get them through who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales what does that mean oh my god were too late you need me all right the frequency is 401 megahertz what do i care ive got nobody but those whales what are you talking about im coming with you yes if you have a chart on board i can show you if we keep going up theyll catch us what kind of spaceship is this anyway they were taken last night i wasnt told theyre in alaska by now kirk theyre gone but kirk have i flipped out is any of this real its true what you said here in the park i bet youre a damn good poker player so there we are sorry thats classified i dont really have a clue who you are you wouldnt want to show me around your space ship would you well admiral that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story ive ever heard jesus you are persistent okay your friend was right gracie is not only pregnant she is very pregnant at noon tomorrow in what is sure to be a media circus the whales get shipped out are you kidding i wouldnt miss this for all the tea in china well why didnt you say so why all the coy disguises im all ears well i was close i knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later dont tell me youre from outer space who are you wan na try it from the top you got a pocket pager what are you a doctor whats that lets just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived problem is they wont be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year so that as they say is that damn sorry the time would have to be right now my whales where could you take them where theyd be safe where could you take them i told you im a sucker for hard luck cases besides i want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that gracie is pregnant and calls you admiral thanks cheers you you cant even get from sausalito to san francisco without a lift see yes but well tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them theyll be flown in a special 747 to alaska and released there youre very perceptive just lucky i guess good a large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions and a michelob do you trust me hes just going to hang around the bushes while we eat how did you know gracies pregnant nobody knows that or believe ill bet then all right who are you and dont jerk me around any more i want to know how you know that well thats something ida let you off right here it means that they will be at risk from whale hunters same as the rest of the humpbacks what did you mean when you said all that stuff back at the institute about extinction theyre gon na hafta take their chances go ahead a landlubber come on what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there was it some kinda macho thing if thats all im gon na be real disappointed i hate that macho type uh huh what about you where you from dont mention it and dont try anything either i got a tire iron right where i can get at it youve already been that cmon lds are you dyslexic on top of everything else come on lem me give you a lift i have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases thats why i work with whales i buy that what about him came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies huh the hell you were buster your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales ohhh kay i dont know what this is about but i want you guys outta here right now or i call the cops soon its too bad because theyre very friendly as you can see ive grown quite attached to them this way well for one thing we simply dont have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return george and gracie to the open sea they are mature humpbacks weighing 45000 pounds each they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here we call them george and gracie to put it mildly since the dawn of time men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point a hundred years ago using handthrown harpoons they did plenty of damage but that was nothing compared to what theyve achieved in this centuryi live here remember you got your f14 you got top gun you got your migsyoure our new top gun instructornow what well i think i have i could be wrong i have been before just remember one thing if youre not top gun if youre not fighting jets youre not gon na be able to act like a fighter pilot youre gon na have to act like the rest of us youre gon na have to master humility for you guys thats the toughest maneuver of all hey i never said i was a fighter piloti never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm i can find contentment in a good book i dont have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire sometimesi just get happy being with the right man and im gon na sneak off and be by myself for awhile like until i can think of a new careerhotel management or something ive got a gift just like you do my gift is i just know what people mean even if they cant say it it helps when youre trying to communicate with fighter pilots like what you just said was im embarrassed i feel ive done something wrong that ive failed and i dont think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself that about it i know exactly what you mean long distance i wouldnt do that to you id at least talk to you you werent gon na say goodbye well say it together on the count of threeonetwo looks like a tie your watch and thats one you didnt mean it you didnt think youd do anything to take it back that wasnt fair it was a question penalty round thats up to you take something off true the big one the one thats most on your mind you say the truth go ahead dont be afraid you want to win the game dontcha want to play the game not as silly as some you know the silliest one that we are gods that we control events on the beach that we can turn back time its like strip poker only without the bluffing one person says something and if the other one accepts that its true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off its strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play i like to play reality i sit i think i play games everything passes immutable law of the universe only when youre depressed then it passes you dont believe that of course the lines just imaginary you can cross it twenty timesnothing really changes you look way out there out past the date line west becomes east all things change you cross the linetoday becomes yesterdayor tomorrow i forget which what what do you want i dont think so but if thats what you want do what show you a good time where are we you know where we are its called the beach its where life first crawled up out of the sea i come here sometimes when i feel like crawling back in you knew it you all do its part of it maybe the most important part why you act like you didnt know one day this would happen thats what you get flight pay for thats not what i hear the dark side the price you pay for all the fun youre having you knew about it of course didnt you this is it then they say youre alright whered you get it what do you take me for its a navy cross doesnt it ever bother
