their dicks and gross stuff but no ones ever said hey there beautiful what did he say youre just saying that i started out on that eyeofnewt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate okay i guess so its just as well im afraid of getting hurt again mark seemed great at first too i dont want to get too attached to peter and then find out hes a creep we almost slept together and then the hair started and i booked i looked like an italian man im freaking out im like an animal and totally out of control my arms keep getting really hairy what the hell is the tampon test i dont know much about him how do you know if a guy is decent i dont think ive ever actually liked anyone ive dated before peter even likes me without makeup im sorry i didnt want you to think i was still a doormat um he stopped by yesterday before you came over i wonder if hes married he was cute huh of course whenever i meet a guy im wearing no makeup no mark wears boxers they must have been in the dryer already my vision got worse again and my bra finally fits again i think i went in and fell asleep i guess gregory walked home and got killed i blacked out he was trying to get into my apartment and i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on i grabbed him and kissed him i couldnt stop eating steak i felt out of control like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian i couldnt get enough and then gregory walked me home and he peed in front of me i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory i dont remember we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period alone no i dont think so did i kill him of course not why would they exaggerate and he was ripped limb from limb hes dead am i bad luck or what oh my glasses maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them holy shit im a freak where where do you think a mustache would be look i never thought of it like that i never know what to do on dates do guys still pay maybe they have to pee youre so lucky you have george and dont need to go on dates anymore why did gregory ask me out i mean hes cute he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea george bit you i think she broke the skin even on sale that stuffs a fortune i worked all week to pay for a bra can you believe she fuckin bit me where are all the mediums i dont know what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for shouldnt a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie or if theres a full moon no it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye only to see youre just saying that id kill for just a little bloated sorry its just so bad lately youre so lucky you never get pms my date always pays more attention to you than to me he hasnt said one word to me i wonder what its like being you being noticed all the time i guess i have a weakness for him its those big brown bambi eyes hes a very talented musician my shrink says hes not so bad translation a total geek yeah even then look what happened michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me i have cramps i cant believe i let you talk me into this yeah whip it out you want me to see it thats what this is all about right uh huh so pee youre just saying that to get into my apartment and then youre hoping thatll turn into something else you dont have to pee oh come on knock it off my apartments just such a mess you should have gone at the restaurant what well i have it worse than cramps goodnight gregory no really im i dont feel well ive got terrible pms im really tired id really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner thats great highly original im not really hungry after all starving youre kidding really i do development for tv movies i

cant help it it smells so good oh my god im sorry no you never say that since when do you care no i quit take your lame ass ideas your fake ass toupee your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them no mr grant did you read that script i was talking about i think we should do something with strong female characters i cant read any more crap these women are all victims a little how about a man in jeopardy story your desk on your desk on your desk heres a towel okay im so sorry i i couldnt help it you know i didnt mean to to do any of that what about those guys i might have worse than this maybe we should have children i dont think id kill the father of my child no it doesnt work that way men cant get pms unfortunately be careful i cant take that chance i couldnt live with myself if i did anything to you how do you know peter i love you too but go away i might hurt you i knew you wouldnt believe me just go away go very far away no you cant it it gets so bad that i become a werewolf you want the truth remember i tried to tell you something the other day yes sort of i mean no not really no dont come over peter i i dont want to see you anymore ever hello i did

say it no i wanted to say it no its just no ones ever said that and i thought if someone did ever say it id have to say it first and then theyd sort of say i love you too cause they felt they had to after id said it no my bites a lot worse this is a lot worse than betty interesting possibility no but thanks for the warning whats that supposed to mean i just dont know if i should be dating anyone right now what happened no i got it its okay yeah sort of wheres lloyd no why but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces mark wouldnt hurt a fly it wasnt a date jennifer invited me along to dinner with them uh the buzzers broken ill be down in a second uh hi everything okay no i i checked when i put my stuff in i always look through the washer first no nope nothing in it im sorry im on edge today oh my god you scared the shit out of me you following me again no no im fine maybe i should go i mean i dont want our first time to be like this my period no whats wrong okay you busted me what are they for what are those goodnight yeah maybe i really got ta get going hes bad news he cheated on me he insults me now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date cool i dont get guys who wear boxers my ex wore boxers i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up how about you briefs or boxers a lot of people dont wear underwear like what ive read scripts about detectives but never met one must be wild im so sorry peter gee that sure puts my problems in perspective oh my god by wolves im sorry used to did it stop finally its stupid oh its nothing no really i dont drink coffee anymore i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently im trying to stay away from caffeine thats my ex hes an asshole in case you couldnt tell i think hes been following me i got ta get going peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag intriguing are you following me i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door we he walked me home and we said goodnight um he kissed me goodnight and that was it cause im a fucking werewolf we didnt have sex i dont know i dont remember doing it i ate a guy last night i think im a werewolf that im a doormat of course the shrink makes more notes no hes not hes a courier he picks up packages from the airport no i have a cat no we left the restaurant and and i felt sick so so i took a cab home alone what makes you think i was the last one yes jennifer told me what does that have to do with me no take it no i said it was our first date no it was our first date yes i we had dinner oh my god what happenedsure see ya oh thank god maybe this whole thing is really over frida you okay sorry i shouldnt go on about myself at a time like this are you sure youre going to be okay we were i was just so tempted it was sort of a test i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george but now george knows about benito and he doesnt want to be with me no hes the guy im having an affair with about benito i think george knows no i wont let you do that i guess youll find out remember what madame sconce said if you love him hell be fine youll get through this you were fine for over three weeks you scared the shit out of me i thought you were killing yourself fall in love what choice do we have the weird thing is he shot her with a silver bullet she died at age 34 in the 1800s they thought she was crazy she was banished from her town seems her husband shot her the femalecycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves see i knew you never loved mark this is from a scientist in france madame sconce the original werewolves were females they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the womans cycle my suspicion is that the only cure is true love check out what i found we dont know youre a werewolf it might never happen again you have to get on with your life maybe you should go out with him if you keep avoiding him hell get suspicious besides what better way to not get busted than to date the cop whos investigating you symptoms include loss of emotional control compulsive behavior cravings crying spells so are you look go about your life act like nothings wrong well get to the bottom of this lets do some research ill check the libraries you surf the web does that mean this whole thing is over well if he does he didnt give you away he must really like you hide him tell them youll meet them outside ignore it you expecting someone at least i finally saw the reason you couldnt get over mark okay lets say that this is pms related you think those male cops are going to understand that youll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin we have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves if you ask me the fucker got what he deserved im glad hes dead why the fuck would you do that you say murder but you have no idea what happened you dont remember doing it so its out of your control how could i im helping you clean up marks remains and you ask how could i cheat on george theres kind of this guy im seeing first of all youre my alibi i told george i was with you last night dont call the police what happened to his tooth hes been here all night did you get rid of mark im stopping by later im worried about you bye get rid of him relax carlton was torn apart no way could you have done that maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out or and he was missing an arm frida carltons dead tuesday are you okay frida i was worried to death about you ive called you for two days where have you been frida listen to yourself if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me maybe the blood was from your period like before youre delusional maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip so you tasted blood and the severed arm well i dont see it and maybe this is all in your head youre a pms werewolf of course frida are you on drugs and what makes you think you killed a man so wheres this infamous arm now frida youre not making sense i cant come over right now you fucked carlton see i told you he liked you frida this is a bad time were having sex and george actually answered the phone its just cause mine is finer a little bleachll fix that no theyre not geez i wish id get it like that you might want to tape your nipples down next time its really distracting i still thought it was a purse charming carlton i think he called you beautiful well whatever it was seems to have worked cause you look great great george is meeting carlton first for drinks we can meet and go together itll be a blast no he didnt come on i dont want to be alone with those two all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me hey carltons in town come out with the three of us frida this hair thing is all in your head youre using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone howd it go with the cop you have to stop being so self critical frida youre at his place and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say im so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons if he says no hes too embarrassed then you know hes a wus if he says hes got some in the bathroom then you know there are other women around a lot but if he says yes and goes to get you tampons well then hes a decent guy then while hes out give him the tampon test hmmm sounds suspicious frida im your friend im not judging you you didnt sleep with the creep did you why didnt you tell me you said you hadnt seen him for a month gross so this is marks flesh when did you see him he wasnt wearing a ring but you dont want to date a cop frida theyre so blue collar rule one always wear makeup uh huh good thing those cops didnt see that are those marks i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses at least your pms is over and then what why the hell did he do that i guess youre off that vegetarian kick youve been on for ten years did you get smashed or what you have to eat if youre drinking and not just those little salads you dont think so you either did or your didnt no did you fuck him so did you do it to sound like big macho cops he was probably just found with a knife in his back im sure they were exaggerating there you go blaming yourself for everything again hey did you get contacts you are not frida we all have a little hair there i didnt even notice till you showed me we can bleach that its no big deal i dont see anything maybe just a little where they better of course trouble is you never know what theyll expect for it you got ta know what to order and what youre willing to do like if a guy spends a fortune on you hes gon na feel like you owe him something are you kidding he might as well say can i date rape you what i really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment can i use your phone how about a nightcap i want to meet your cat and my alltime favorite the old standby i have to use your bathroom maybe he likes you ever think of that its good for you to go out get your mind off mark i kind of asked him to we were you know he got a little carried away what a bitch you should see a doctor that can be dangerous george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room and she got the medium frida grab that red one theres a sale its such a nice place classical music relaxing atmosphere you deserve to pamper yourself come on it cant hurt its not about him seeing you in it its how you feel youll feel sexy in lingerie and itll show its an inner thing okay just one more stop and youll be all set victorias secret or if your boyfriends an asshole try to get through dinner without them you have beautiful eyes cant you get contacts do you really need these how about i give you a makeover youll feel better about yourself youre actually pretty youre just not bringing it out i get a little bloated sometimes frida i dont mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men maybe hes just shy people notice you frida so dont look in his eyes every woman at some point has to date a musician i wish youd get rid of mark for good every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out your shrink always gives you bad advice he only hears what you choose to tell him marks an asshole he cheated he borrowed money and never paid it back hes never had a regular job anythings better than mark well thats not going to happen tonight george said carltons a nice guy come on weve been double dating since the fourth grade shes my best friend i got ta be there for her no matter how crazy it sounds ive been in some bad relationships and shes been there for me shes lonely if pretending shes a werewolf helps then more power to her take some allergy medicine dont be stupid george obviously if shes a werewolf she cant be around a cat she might eat it and besides cats are afraid of wolves its so bad she becomes a werewolf tell her im eating so now being with frida is lucky i thought you said she was a flake i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along shes just insecure once you get to know her shes fabulous come on ive been working with frida carlton wont even recognize her now shes really coming out of her shell yeah and when were mad at each other were out of sync it only works if youre on good terms so i asked the bartender what coyote ugly meant its like the bagger system you know a two bagger someone so ugly that you need two bags one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off or a threebagger see he was cheating from the get go i dont know i guess the outfits are cool and i want a big gun i was thinking about becoming a cop myself do you take a test or something or just sign up you want her sheets how the hell is that
