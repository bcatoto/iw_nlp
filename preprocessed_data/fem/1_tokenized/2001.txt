conflict of interest which involves you rose we have a crisis i am sure that you are aware of the horrible allegations against jim cunningham rose rose ill tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and i respect you as a woman but after witnessing your sons behaviour today i have significant doubts our paths through life must be righteous i urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear i think weve all seen bonanza the pta is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our schools curriculum i am the pta and i say that this filth is directly related to this vandalism and how do they do this they flood the house by breaking through the water main the bottom line mr cole is that

here who transcends the parentteacher bridgethen go find her donnie dont let her get away she was right about the rabbits go so will donnie find his cellar door sometimes its the only thing that keeps

are you sure she wasnt there maybe she was just hiding from you what the fuck is she doing she was supposed to be here three hours ago shes not at homeim sorry enid you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you i had to give it to someone else but im sure next year i can well theyre forcing me to give you a nonpassing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition but dont worry im sure ill be able to get you your diploma in the fall oh my goodness well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall im going to do everything i can to help you didnt principal jaffee call you the whole business with the art show and the newspaper its absolutely enid im so sorry about what happened let me know as soon as you can enid this could be a great thing for you well yes so what do you think as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything it is really quite an offer well i know this is really short notice but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art design and she tells me that im allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program and well i hope you dont mind enid but i took the liberty of submitting your name dont worry its nothing bad i was just wondering what your plans were for next year enid can i talk to you for a minute and how does an image like this help us to see that and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism did you actually do this painting these are all valid comments but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this i see interesting and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject who is this enid and what can you tell us about this i think its really a wonderful piece margaret this shocking image of repressed femininity very good now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent i can see that now what can you tell us about it first of all what kind of sculpture is this what do we have here margaret isnt this a wonderful piece class this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier talk to us about it i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there aremany different ways we can express ourselves we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class who is responsible for thisyoure fucked up lila why dont you fucking try electrolysis or something figure it out for chrissake look if youre going to be like

forbidden to wet your hair for at least twentyfour hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thiglycolate chutney why is it that tracy marcinkos curls were ruined when she got hosed down you know a girl in my sorority tracy marcinko got a perm once even though we all told her not to curls really werent the right look for her she didnt have your bone structure how many would you say yes your honor had you ever gotten a perm before miss windham where you got in the shower miss windham can you tell us what youd been doing earlier in the day but you didnt hear the shot

downstairs what happened okay ms windham when you uh arrived back at the house was your father there tell him paulette due to the fact that you retained the residence ms bonafante is entitled to full

its very good but you know you read the novel and then you see the movie and most of the time you say whats this you know i sometimes think were better off not reading the novel at all because we come with expectations and of course we know where were going dont you find its very good i understand you won the booker prize im not much of a reader but i do love autobiographies even biographies sometimes mostly nonfiction did you read the new styron still well lets drop it but i am right yes shes based on sally oh my god im a huge skye davidson fan shes very beautiful congratulations on the

excuse me we live next door monica im so sorry i think its great that i made an impression at all you know i know you changed it to a bookstore and the color of my hair but the moment was exactly the same the same you know dynamic and almost verbatim wasnt it im so glad you know i recognize that passage in your book the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre thats very nice oh

outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help he never turned anyone away after he heard me play i am a violinist he gave me money because i was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to sweden he helped countless people in similar ways i dont know but you and i already know that he has saved lives when he made his decision he couldnt have known everything especially not the way people like you do whove returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement because you are blameless you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness but you have no idea how people lived here dont see me to my door theres no need what does he mean too correct and talking is talking well i think we better get on and no elbows on the table oh and dont wave your hands about thats because you had a proper upbringing i would like to go now please but he had no idea a lot of people had no idea i only realised what was really going on when i got arrested i have been questioned by the gestapo just like that just like you questioned him i cant do this its not right im sorry but i have to leave ill find other work youll have to get someone else thats all of course bruckners seventh major major major hes here im sorry the names of the members of the berlin philharmonic orchestra since 1934 together with their
