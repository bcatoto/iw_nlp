like or how long i was there but i do remember how it felt that ribbon isnt just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space its a doorway it leads to another place the nexus it doesnt exist in our universe and it doesnt play by the same rules either soran doesnt care about power or weapons all he cares about is getting back to the nexus oh yes i remember everyone who was on the

who i choose i choose you hes not invited sang jerk here i am throwing myself at you succumbing to your wily charms and you call me a slut in so many words how about the caitlin bree walk on the boardwalk then get naked somewhere kind of private date the dante hicks dinner and a movie date i think ive been on that one before you mean on a date i dont know maybe we should just see what happens the key word here is talk dante i think the idea the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date you work in a market all right its just the shock of seeing me after three years believe me youll get over it youre serious you want to date again im sure sang andveronicawould like that good stay in that frame of mind i had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on when i say i dont want to get married i mean just that i dont want to marry anybody not for years if im so nuts about you then why am i having sex with an asian design major look how full of yourself you are you dont have anything to do with it why mr hickswhatever do you mean i just told you stop it hes a nice guy i dont want to marry him i dont want to get married now im on the verge of graduation i want to go to grad school after this and then i want to start a career i dont want to be a wife first and then have to worry about when im going to fit in all of the other stuff ive come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife and i know thats what id become sangs already signed with a major firm and hes going to be pulling a huge salary which would give me no reason to work and hes so traditional anyway im giving him his ring back no i wasnt not really i told youd id been seeing other people the last thing i needed was for you to think i was hiding something from you i love a macho faï½ade its such a turnon what smells like shoe polish was i right then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper thats when i hopped the train to come back here because i knew youd be a wreck the story goes like this he proposed and i told him i had to think about it and he insisted i wear the ring anyway then my mother told the paper we were engaged no because i know you you prefer drastic measures to rational ones i wouldve told you and you would have stopped calling like a baby well kind of sort of i know im sorry but when we started talking its like i forgot i had a boyfriend and then he proposed last month i was going to tell you but then we were getting along so well i didnt want to mess it up im not pregnant its not what you think you saw it youre just going to lock the store like that train it took eight hours i just saw alyssas little sister outside she was with rick derris dante youve got a customer just nowdid he say making fuck that doesnt sound metal what did he say no way he only speaks russian no way hes your cousin scumbag what are you doingdoes he sing in english or russian he really wants to play metal is he staying here what part of russiafuck you and having him tell me that was just the weakest move ever youre spineless of course not not now youre caught and now youre trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do well i wont let you i want you to follow through on this just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are and when she dumps you again and she will dante i promise you thatwhen she dumps you again i want to laugh at you right in your face just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for im just glad randal had the balls to tell me since you couldnt you dont know what you want but im not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out ive encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school to take charge of your life and find direction i even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if i was with you everyone said it was a stupid move but i didnt care because i loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk youve been in since that whore dumped you oh so many years ago and now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more youre damn right its not like that because i wont let it be like that you want your slut fine the slut is yours explain what how you were waiting until the time was right and then you were going to dump me for her im not the one trying to patch things up with my ex sneaking around behind your back and if you think that thirtyseven dicks are a lot then just wait mister im going to put the hookers in times square to shame with all the guys i go down on now and then you pull that shit this morning freaking out because ive gone down on a couple guys youve been talking to her on the phone for weeks if you didnt want to go out with me anymore why didnt you just say it instead you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back good ill see you when you close then enjoy the lasagne eight but i have a sorority meeting till nine so ill be back before you close can we go out and get some coffee bummer well ive got ta head back for the onethirty class you couldnt get these shutters open thank you for being rational the ostrich syndrome if you dont see it and that made you feel better what did he say you had to tell him im glad youve calmed down a bit hi randal peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off what do you think it is its lasagne lit 101 got canceled so i stopped home and brought you some lunch goodbye dante im going to school maybe later youll be a bit more rational i love you dont feel sick because going down its a big deal i used to like a guy wed make out and sooner or later id go down on him but i only had sex with the guys i loved and one of those guys was you the last one i might add whichif youre too stupid to comprehend means that ive been faithful to you since we met all the other guys i went with before i met you so if you want to have a complex about it go ahead but dont look at me like im the town whore because you were plenty busy yourself before you met me yeah i went down on a few guys hey listen jerk until today you never even knew how many guys id slept with because you never even asked and then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls well i never had sex with twelve different guys im going to class um thirtyseven lower your voice something like thirtysix all right shut up a second and ill tell you jesus i didnt freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked let it go dante please calm down im sorry dante i thought you understood because i did only sleep with three guys that doesnt mean i didnt just go with people we went out a few times we didnt have sex but we fooled around thats because i never had sex with him yeah how do you think i know he liked im serious sylvan no i snowballed him why do you say that he gets off on it after he gets a blow job he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing its called snowballing sylvan made it up its a blow job thing unlike you i have a class in forty five minutes its important to me dante you have

technically its not mid evil its renaissance they appear to be authentic my name is jennifer hillman im an archaeologist i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you lieutenant lieutenant bedsoe paul i thought we agreed no press you guys are from the british museum right huge electro magnetic soundings indicate weve only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber sounds very normal what now be careful conner hes in there must you fight him where will you go now and the other one he is like you you how did you know that on the back it has would you like to see it not unless theyre immortal for three hundred years yes if they were trying to get in but what if they werent what if they were trying to get out why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern they were wedged in tight they couldnt get a grip on them they would have had much more strength pushing on them let me ask you something else at the excavation site in scotland the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks making a hole in the collapsed section what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall because i dont feel like sitting in a rubber room for fortyeight hours no the calan do you know who they are yes it is a little yes my interest in coming here is profession how come you wanted to meet tonight youre not an easy person to get to know im just trying to place you you have an interesting accent where are you from you didnt answer my question youre twenty minutes late why yes you look like you have have you ever heard of the calan it probably wouldnt interest you its something i read in a mythology book you talk to me but you dont answer my questions i guess ill have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe do you always walk around with a sword then how did he know your name who was that man last night why do you stare at me like that jennifer then whos russell nash whats going on why did he call you macleod youre hurt its mine its been in my family for years it belonged to my great great great grandmother why whats going on if its good advice why do i feel that you know whats going on bullet proof vests dont bleed i dont think so but then maybe youve can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the first national bank this afternoon and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out yes how did you know yes we found another man outside a site we were working at in scotland to talk to you no im an archaeologist i was wondering if i could talk to you my name is jennifer hillman i was at the police station earlier today well see i like my work i know paul i was working on the cataloging and this i dont think it is a duplication his head someone cut it off we found him this morning i dont know hes fine he swears he never left his post for a moment he heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside someone broke into the cavern last night were holding the workers down below then we shouldnt break into the cavern until tomorrow morning this could be a very important find i want it documented where is the film crew from the british museumhello im plenty happy im happy enough well in connection with my job sometimes i have to go undercover as it were its hardly the same well maybe i why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president that smart so if you know everything about hudsucker tell me why the board decided to make norville barnes president yeah yeah say you wont tell anyone about me will you but who are you what dyou do here who are you how did you know who i am muncie yeah and ill bet his initials are sidney j mussburger but al its the bunk norville

prove it we can norville im sorry i i tried to tell you so many times its hard to admit when youve been wrong if you could just find it in your heart to to give me another chance oh norville i norville consider this my resignation shutup after all you havent talked to me for a week and now im going to say my piece ive got a prediction for you norville barnes i predict that since youve decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad youre going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you youre going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldnt give you the time of day if you if you shutup but then i figured out you were a swell guy a little slow maybe but a swell guy well maybe youre not so slow but youre not so swell either and it looks like youre an imbecile after shutup and dont think i havent noticed how youve changed i used to think you were a swell guy well to be honest i thought you were an imbecile ive been watching you norville barnes even though youve been trying to avoid me youre awful kind to yourself norville barnes the fact is youve slowed down sitting up here like a sultan not doing a lick of work why you know its ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you havent come up with one since the hoop and the reasons plain to see youve forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasnt for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here your i you mean you know about this theyre going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker why in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work people with wives and children and families you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing never mind about that for petes sake norville sure norville sure oh norville yeah i think ive heard of that what goes around comes around i wish it were that simple norville i wish i was still a gazelle and you were an antelope or an ibex norville there really is something i have to tell you oh i dont know maybe i was just a fasttalking career gal who thought she was one of the boys what a beautiful thought the people look like ants well this year if its good i plan to make it a tradition uh my it certainly is beautiful yes you can get carrot juice or italian coffee and

let me hold it or youll have a real shiner let me look what happened maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance smitty oh is that it im quite sure i dont know what you mean confused sure but she could still have gotten your side for the record well i dont know maybe she does deserve it maybe she shouldve come in to face you man to man why dont i just type this up well i im sure i is that all mr barnes or lack thereof well i didnt bother to read the article i didnt think the picture did you justice well i just dont know how to thank you mr barnes of course i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic oh no really i why yes do you know it these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town youve probably never heard of no thank you seek and ye shall find work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education the ethics of my tender years a little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination a solid work ethic and an indomitable belief in the future at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago full of dreams and aspirations anxious to make my way in the world what a horrible little person i dont want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life its not a happy story the couch please im sorry we had to take the stairs it was just that horrible little elevator boy i filed it yesterday on payday the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you al sez me amy archer why is he an idea man because hudsucker says he is whatre his ideas why wont they let anyone interview him as a threedollar bill i tell ya the guys a phony youre fools both of you its obvious theyre out to crucify norville theyre trying to destroy him says who you cant print that its about a dimwitted editor who ive got an even hotter story the sap from the city desk muncie i dont know why not its all true the board is using this poor guy theyre depressing the stock so they can buy it cheapwell frankly i

eightbyten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse before you start picking your nose i know he put you up to it you venice i love venice with the boats right where are you going uh in case dwayne wants to try to reach you wait where are you damon bradley i can hardly hear you could you spell that im sure hell be sorry to hear that who should i tell him called this is his fiancee whos this hes not in at the moment can i take a message hello is anybody there i brought you that too there is no us thats not the point and what if i had wanted to yes no it isnt i called off my wedding all because of you gee im flattered what an incredibly romantic gesture cancel the roses ive decided to lie to her instead rational love is not rational are you crazy i would call it unforgivable a little white lie a little white lie well i mightve found him again if i hadnt left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you youre the reason i never met him you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it i cant believe you did that no one had to tell me hes starring in the local play who cares you hired an actor what you want a hint ill give you a hint you are the lowest most despicable most reprehensible form of reptilian swine get out i just need to run up and get my bathing suit yes i am thank you so since i have a few more days of vacation left i was wondering if maybe youd want to do something sometime i mean you know if you dont have other plans no i mean yes im not i decided to call it off well actually it was kind of mutual yeah well anyway i also wanted to tell you im not getting married it seems like ever since i found out about this guy this name ive been kind of crazy like i was on drugs or something no i just came by to apologize hi are you busy no course not no it was more than that it was very generous of you it was very kind i feel like the worlds biggest idiot yeah well how about those old romantic movies with those great stars huh like audrey hepburn how about music you like classical well what about books you like hemingway you got ta love hemingway so were you why are you doing this i dont know if thats such a you were saying what are you doing here thank you peter thank you so much what you too just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs nothing fancy well good good for you oh thats nice you found him i dont know how to thank you hi peter no right now mickey spillane please i need to know tell me he likes to read did he mention anyone in particular why oh no i dont think that would be a good idea wheres positano why not who says i dont love him dont you see were not the ones who are meant to be youre the man of somebody elses dreams no that wasnt a lie that was a mirage so it wasnt real look peter i dont hate you but what we had was an illusion mutual wishful thinking we both wanted to believe it for awhile but it was all founded on a lie what why are you asking me this he wants to marry me doesnt he so is there something wrong with loving somebody whos safe because i know who dwayne is and hes reliable and stable and wants to marry me yes yes if its any of your business yes no i know im limping i stubbed my toe oh come on what kind of an excuse is that how could you do this to me that was before i found out what it was thats not the point what so you say youve been to italy before oh hello uh the scampi sounds good to me too you like shrimp i like shrimp what looks good dont worry about it youre my guest excuse me well to new friends really sure oh faith my names faith yes okay good see you then then you would really would you be willing to have dinner with me any night i was wondering do you have dinner plans i just got here too not yesterday but just now today just a few minutes ago yeah we just got here i mean i just got here im single been here long beautiful place youre damon bradley larry did you rent a car im fine have you seen peter i dont know ive just been thinking maybe this destiny thing is more of a doityourself operation maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for and larry actually no theres not going to be a wedding i didnt expect you back so soon kate is that you so i guess ive got a wedding to go to i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel i spent my whole life waiting for a creep hes a jerk maybe if i kiss him ill feel it maybe i can change him no i think maybe youve been right i think i may have been too critical in the past no ones perfect kate kate thank god youre there i need help my god youre right what if he doesnt like me is damon bradley here hes down in someplace called positano peter says we can make it there by morning yes isnt that amazing im sure and kate thank you for coming thank you for being such a good friend no no you go ahead what the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind may as well start packing our cabs gon na be here in an hour peter peter was a mistake an imposter yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened it was a ouija board remember i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know a little bad luck because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase packing hi whereve you been but how could he know he only just met me dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gon na find him like a detective i meant about my idea and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and what right okay its meant to be right this is it right right okay you dont think hes gon na think im too aggressive is he looking at us oh my god where okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here sure you did because im the one whos single i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gon na think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden right my brother anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and larry bought himself cologne and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that course he does i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him sorry you expecting somebody you know nothing you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them i told you a liter was less than a gallon the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy what was i gon na do tell him the truth only its in italian a phone message only were saved oh right maybe theres fingerprints on it a butterfinger wrapper ah ha so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned he fell out just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for ill never meet the man of my dreams we lost him i cant believe we came all this way and hes gone well were here and more importantly hes here well cut back on everything else are you sure what i dont know maybe think of it as an adventure its called the gritty palace now what do we do sure im fine i dont know why i never did this before i mean whats the big deal youre coming with me maybe how hard can it be ill land there ill go to his hotel ill introduce myself and he was on his way to venice right i called the tourist bureau and i mustve called every hotel in the city but i found where hes staying thank you so much no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor thats where youre wrong i got one nine years ago i just never had an opportunity to use it i have vacation time coming to me its still the new year it was my new years resolution to overcome it the woman at my dry cleaners believes theres no such thing as coincidence its a miracle after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really dont think have you seen him with someone is that bad kate is something the matter i understand kate what do you think of this garter i know youre right yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies i know it was look how big it makes me look i look like an alp yes you did why should i ask someone out who i dont want to go out with in the first place no hes never asked me hes a podiatrist or something i dont know kate so hes not my type let me walk you to the elevator i dont know i dont think so no no i wish you didnt have to go so early just that they came out of somebodys experience is all but somebody wrote those songs is everything okay metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer i dont have an amana freezer dont tell me oprah did a show scientologist just moved in with his girlfriend no he smokes i dont believe in statistics yeah hes around somewherelook she wasnt a relative okay i dont know who she is of course not no she wasnt my sister yes but he was having an affair no no really she thinks hes here even though shes never met him even though shes never laid eyes on him so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams shes trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker my friend has lost her fucking mind hes gone he told me what happened he just left for the airport what about larry well i ought to be getting home anyway the kidsll be back from camp soon the house is probably a mess oh well i realized if youre getting married youre gon na be needing the maid of honor right uh huh so when you couldve found one in america yup yes he is or maybe itll turn him back into a toad i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldnt need to change and he is living proof not only is he a mommas boy and a fascist he says nuculear and irregardless uh huh okay well be there how is he anyway faith im kidding is this how you plan to get what you want from life when you finally find it you turn and run away from it it means youre a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable whatareyoudoing joan collins stayed here amazing peter found him ill be back before you leave you sure youll be okay im just not ready to go home quite yet thats all who said i was going what about peter and a fortune teller i know but so youre just quitting just like that okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up so youve had a little bad luck why sightseeing whatre you doing hiiii men have ways yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that no like a psychiatrist i think its time we got some professional help that was really sweet and then what faith well nobody can say we didnt try good luck faith faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gon na tip the scales nope hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow hes heeeeeerrre not if you dont count the sixth grade i never even got to be single well how come were always looking for guys for you so whats in a name i wan na join him i dont see why we cant join him youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gon na play hard to get youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile whats she saying what did you say to her her brother polo he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that that was a long time ago you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out you think he misses me at all so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway well you dont have to get snippy with me whats that supposed to mean im hungry we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile couldnt we just have taken a train your brother only what what is it were not looking to arrest the man faith were trying to locate him a rich possibly fat slob whatd you find so i just got a dial tone i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit what are you doing faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gon na do me any good you and the other 99 of the women in the world you gave it your best shot you tried yes cathy lee crosby stayed here of the rich and famous of which we are neither are you out of your mind we cant afford this this is a lifestyles hotel gritty is this gon na be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who dont believe in deodorant the book said they have boats that are like taxis vaporettos whats the name of the place were staying again you okay i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies live happily ever after a foreign land full of millions of italian men speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin youre just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets my god you have i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days does dwayne know about this because you were afraid to fly you dont have a passport what about your job but its july its a coincidence no i can just tell i think hes having an affair larry brought me flowers last night i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gon na be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn but what i think it was sweet of him to pick it out come on its not so bad well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him why dont you ask him thrills thats what youre waiting for you know how long that lasts besides how do you know have you ever been out with him you dont have any idea whats he do so is he gay is he married yeah well larry and his friends are hungry and i did say id try to pick something up no faith they came out of somebodys imagination so whats your point yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing so you got ta be a little flexible look at your brother and me larrys not perfect neither am i but we work it out were not unrealistic in our expectations and we have each other i think youve got the door number three syndrome oh how about that guy at the bank how about the other one his friend what about that guy you work with mike whatshisname youre an accountant for cryin out loud i dont know i guess i never really thought about it is larry here thats exactly what you are giovanni but i do want to no you dont understand its been wonderful meeting you but i have a husband i have two kids at camp i have a life i have to go back to giovanni i want to thank you how old are you oh id love to giovanni this is faiths friend peter a porco my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is can you tell us what shes saying no well i dont know well maybe later kate and you didnt tell her she what faith larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley he missed me larry youve got to tell her went to high school with him but are you saying you just made the whole thing up the guy never even existed what you know him you said it differently then dont call me doll larry i hate it when you call me doll sociologist and because pawn shops are just like prostitutes farm auctions and coal miners theyre all for sale but none of em would be if they werent desperate for the money not only is it tacky its exploitation no right no why you miss me sorry oh its you its only peter thats the guy youve been waiting for all these years ten billion to one thats really romantic mania good strategy she went

had such a thing hello hello well you certainly had a good look around thats not him no i dont who david i promise we will keep him happy for ever and ever sshh stop nagging be careful ok i dont want

drunk alex so well meet him then who was it he seemed like a nice guy alex more than anyone she has ever met in her whole life she hated you for the flat maybe you should go alexyoull meet someone wonderful i thought you stopped going just serve ok so a has left you b is ambivalent youre still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for what are we to make of this if i were you id ditch the lot

cost david two hundred pounds two hundred its alright i think he got the message anyway do you think you could be a little more forceful next time yes theyre my friends would you like to talk about it are you all right alex i think its time for you to stop yes just get on with it alex its just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is quite simply just that look its a fairly straightforward question youre either divorced or youre not why do you want a room here oh him well he died here what guy that died

that will be it back on the merry go round you want me to wear white for you you must be madder than i thought what is it whats wrong nothing could be better psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons what then make it stop what was your relationship with stephanie did stephanie kill your mother stephanie did you tell me about your adopted mother wonderful like a great release he was a malignant cancer and i had to remove him the world is better without him why should i thats rightdont ever think that you and i are the same were not even remotely similar i did what i had to do for myself for my own self preservation not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy my husband was sick i dont think sothis isnt a game you knowthere arent points or leagues sure i killed my husband but i am no killer what didnt you like about her then why did you marry her tell me about your wife how long have you been watching me do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed is white an expression of innocence do you crave innocence leslie is their colour an expression of their inner self by that i mean extroverts wear bright colours so what are people who wear white ok the press call you the white angle because you only kill girls wearing white why white white clothes blonde hair the press think that the white angel is a woman why is that do you dress up leslie what did you do with her didnt debbie deserve anymore i dont know where do you kill them you dont know and how many people have you killed and how long have you been a dentist so what do you do sugar i
