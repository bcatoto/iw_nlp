cancel and they asked if you would be interested morton hull the producer of this evening just called oh mr gardiner ive been looking all over would you care to take it sir mr gardiner i have a telephone call for you sidney courtney the financial editor of the washington posti know robert but strangely enough i dont feel too bad about now i feel all right i guess its easier knowing chauncey is here to take care of things no more robert no more needles in a minute robert in a minute chauncey i would like to ask a favor of you we have common foes chauncey kid lawyers and our physician no of course you dont excuse me for being so presumptuous no man knows everything about another man however very few are honest enough to admit it of course by kidlawyers i know exactly what you mean today the businessman is at the mercy of kidlawyers from the sec all they want to do is regulate our natural growth its happening across the country ive worked very hard and enjoyed my life ive known success and ive felt love my associates chauncey ive talked with them about you theyre eager to meet you very eager to meet you im very fond of you chauncey and i understand eve tell her that tell her im madly in love with her she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey theres much to be looked after let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey let me feel your strength yes thats good i hope chauncey i hope that youll stay with eve take care of her watch over her shes a delicate flower chauncey im about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel my boy chauncey chauncey good together the two of you should create quite a stir i can already hear the gossip senator rowleys widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union i think its rather obvious that robert wont allow me to attend so would you go in my place and escort eve and now chauncey im afraid you must excuse me im very tired all of a sudden and please chauncey dont rush your decision i know youre not a man to act on the spur of the moment oh sure you do the financial assistance program i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking id like you to meet with the members of the board well be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time you know chauncey theres something about you youre direct you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly you dont play games with words to protect yourself i feel i can speak to you frankly you know what i was talking to you about last night he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately seldom if ever at all hes a decent fellow the president isnt he i think what my most insightful friend is saying mr president is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey maybe one day yes when i was younger i had thoughts about public office but i found chauncey that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen of course my wealth provided me with considerable influence but ive tried believe me not to misuse that power its extremely important chauncey when one is in a position of eminence that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country the temptations are strong and ive been labeled a kingmaker by many but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people i have tried to remain honest to myself no one likes a dying man my boy because few know what death is all we know is the terror of it but youre an exception chauncey thats what i admire in you your marvelous balance you dont stagger back and forth between fear and hope youre a truly peaceful man hah its all makeup chauncey i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i didnt want the president to think i was going to die during our talk well thats good news my boy chauncey up and around this morning are you oh robert take a look would you reluctant to speak eh chauncey well i can understand that when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time just give it some thought work with the idea im sure youll have plenty to say in a few days yes im sure it is thats what they say anyway now wait a minute chauncey you are young you are healthy for gods sake dont give up on yourself you have to fight you cant let those bastards keep you down i dont want to hear any more from you about the room upstairs thats where im going soon bravo a gardener well put chauncey excellent isnt that what a businessman is a gardener a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of value for his family and community yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard do we have a garden hah tomorrow chauncey you will see our gardens and im ben thats good mr gardiner or may i call you chauncey whatd i tell you kidlawyers the sec damn them oh when you say your house has been closed you mean to say that your business was shut down so am i my boy so am i you will join us for dinner wont you mr gardiner were prisoners mr gardiner were prisoners of tubes and technology failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells not a damn thing they can do about it oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr gardiner is that its generally a young persons disease here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young persons disease sure you do this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up welcome to rand memorial hospital mr gardiner thank you chauncey thank you very much all right robert im all yours thats good thats good im becoming quite attached to chauncey quite attached and so are you arent you eve do you need a secretary hah tell me the truth eve if i wait until i feel better will i ever meet the man reasonable good id like to meet a reasonable man why dont you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner i may be a shutin but i do not lack for news im sorry you had to go through all that no its been a good day better than yours from what ive been told tired and im getting tired of being so tired other than that im doing very well you take care too bobby youre right mr president i dont like feeling sorry for myself nonsense mr president i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man no she flew up to boston for another charity event shell be sorry to have missed you im afraid so there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can youve reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis and from where i see it mr president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible i sympathize with your position mr president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos overall pretty good but mr president i think its very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game yes i did mr president id like you to meet my dear friend mr chauncey gardiner im not convinced of that mr president but your visit has raised my spirits mr president how good to see youbecause my son is here and his father is here as a mother i dont want my child to be separated from his father yeslook during the last five years we were married i hadi was getting more and moreunhappy more and more frustrated i needed to talk to somebody i needed to find out if it was me if i was going crazy or what but every time i turned to tedmy exhusband he couldnt handle it he became veryi dont know very threatened i mean when ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack anyway we became more and more separate more and more isolated from one another finally i had no other choice i had to leave and because of my exhusbands attitudehis unwillingness to deal with my feelings i had come to have almost no self esteem at the time i left i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with methat my son would be better off without me it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasnt a terrible person and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that didnt make me unfit to be a mother yes very much i make thirtyone thousand dollars a year yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer yes i tried to talk to ted my exhusbandabout it but he wouldnt listen he refuses to discuss it in any serious way i remember one time he said i probably couldnt get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for billy no i did not the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult six years yes i consider it less my failure than his i was not a failure we were married two years before the baby and then four very difficult years yes i suppose ii dont know somewhere in between i dont recall i dont recall no no no no no no yes okayi think ill go talk to my son now how do i look only can i still see him hes already got one mother he doesnt need twohes yours i wont fight you for him any more hes yours after i leftwhen i was in california i began to think what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child it got to where i couldnt tell anybody about billyi couldnt stand that look in their faces when i said he wasnt living with me finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved himand i did and i won onlyit was just another should sitting in that courtroom hearing everything you did everything you went through something happened i guess it doesnt matter how much i love him or how much you love him i guess its like you said the only thing that counts is whats best for billy i dont know maybe thats all love is anyway ted i think billy should stay with you pleaseplease dont stop me this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do ted when we got married it was because i was twentyseven years old and i thought i should get married andwhen i had billy it was because i thought i should have a babyand i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and ted do you love him ted do you love him please ted i never would have brought it up if i thought im sorryi just mentioned it in passing i never thought hed use it ted if you cant discuss this rationally ted all my life id either been somebodys daughter or somebodys wife or somebody elses mother then all of a sudden i was a thirtytwoyearold highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get only i guess it wasnt far enough so i started going to a shrink ted ive had time to think ive been through some changes ive learned a lot about myself ted listen to meyou and i we had a really crappy marriage look dont get so defensive okay it was probably as much my fault as it was yours anyway when i left i was really screwed up i want my son im through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street i want my son tedthe reason i wanted to see youi want billy back watching my sonted ive been living in new york for the past two months he looks like a terrific kid a few times sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to

ted ive got to goive got to go ted i canti triedi really tried buti just cant hack it anymore im not taking him with me no you didnt you didnt even ask about billy you just dont get it do you i am really and truly leaving you ted youre not listening to me its over finished look its not your fault okay its me its my faultyou just married the wrong person ive paid the rent the coned and the phone

fire and ice campaign every layoutevery ideaevery single thing right down the line murray you dope oconnor doesnt give a damn about billy all he wants is somebody thatll hang around with him every night so he wont have to go home you want to know why ill tell you why another scotch and soda for the gentleman ill tell you exactly why because youre not his buddy anymore because he cant count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him oconnors out to get you hes going to take the fire and ice account away from you kramer he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken kramer ive got to go ive got an eight oclock closing tomorrow down on centre street yes ill have dinner with you yes sureits beautiful its just beautiful they have a beautiful relationship charley my husband and i are divorced and kim thats our daughter is about billys age and the children play together a lot so i guess we see each three or four times a week six years ever since ted and joanna moved into the building ted i just heard maybe i said maybe what i mean is ahi dont think itll really work out but charley seems to want it so ah charley and i arewell were thinking abouti mean actually were sort of talking about maybe getting back together ted you heard anything yet me you want me to take care of billy dont say that i dont want to hear you say that what sure i told her youre doing a uh huhyeah uh huhshe said she had a good job was playing a lot of tennis she wanted to know all about billy not for a couple of months the last time i heard from her she was living in san francisco look i know this isnt gon na make any sense okay i mean forget the logic partbut i keep thinking if charley really loved me he wouldnt have let me divorce him no i dont think so three and add some basil no not really i guess its different if you dont have children buti dunno even if charley and i dont live together even if were sleeping with other people even if charley was to marry againhed still be my husband that stuff about till death do you part thats really true lenox hill 77th street between park and lex the emergency number is 3270800 youre sure youre on your own understand ive got enough trouble raising my own kid i dont need another one got it all rightokaybut lets get something straight right now i mean im sorry about what happened between you and joanna but its not my problem understand look this is nothing personal but i dont think you can do it i mean what are you going to do about billy what are you going to do ted divorce is a terrible thing i know i went through it youve got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay but ill tell you something you may not want to hear it but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did no maybe she didnt feel like she should have to maybe she felt like if youd been paying any real attention to her to start with maybe you wouldve noticed oh for shits sake ted you are the most selfish human being i have ever met no wonder she said you came first then billy then if there was anything left over she got the scraps what dyou know about how joanna felt you went off to an office every morning and youd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell i meanthings ted joannas very unhappy and ted joanna and i used to talk a lot andwell she told me a lot ofah things about the two of you ted dont be so hostile ohmygod didnt she say anything she mustve said something ted all i wanted to know
