that im hungry jf we scared each other pretty good didnt we i have some but i have to find out where they are staying they left i dont have one hi pris i was tired and didnt have any place to gothat some of the folks around here are more programmed then me you know what i think what difference will it make do you think i simulated what happened between us dont you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered why do you call it retire why dont you call it murder ten years uhhuh have you ever known anybody a long time youre sick deckard this feels stupid but then how can you but if i dont plug it in how can i they could clean around the arrangement it appears to be dirty why dont you get somebody have you ever cleaned your apartment when was the last time you cleaned this place im not sure is there a secret i dont know i think i missed something i dont know i have nothing to compare it to i guess i thought there was something more to it nobody is freer than when he dreams i read that thats another thing i cant do did you cry when your father died i wish i could do you dream what do people do in the afternoon how are you doing how come youre not on the job oh where is he

you i couldnt im sorry do i make you nervous so im a piece of equipment use me you use your equipment dont you two of us might be more effective than one theres two reasons a man rejects help either because hes so good at what he does he doesnt think he needs it or hes so insecure he cant admit it i think you need more help than youve got i know you think it complicates your work but im here to help ugh it would be my child that would be murder mr deckard id never get an abortion is this testing whether im an android or a lesbian id kill it id take him to the doctor i wouldnt accept it also id report the person who gave it to me to the police for the responsibility of your power being a police bureaucrat youve got more than your share are you apprehensive of course not but because your department cant do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large its a problem correct mr deckard it seems your department doesnt believe out new unit is to the public benefitokay thanks

be sorry for what they did to me the woods were cold and damp from the rain i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree but the footsteps just stopped the woods were dark i couldnt see anything i heard a cracking noise behind me i turned around and and oh god there was this hideous looking man so grotesque he was almost inhuman he had a knife and he started to slash away at me again and again i was so hysterical and i dont know how i was able to get away i ran and ran but he kept coming he was big but so fast he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he he ripped my blouse off i was screaming but who could hear me then oh god he dragged me by the hair along the ground i was kicking and yelling he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods oh please please you promised youd never ask me im trying im really trying im
