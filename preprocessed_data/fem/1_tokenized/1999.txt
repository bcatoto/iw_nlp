you you really dont thats skip skipperton man he gets himself hit by a truck this whole town shuts down four months two and a half weeks thats how long and youve already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined how long you been in this town youre terrible im never telling you anything man you see him a lot and its very wrong to reveal it next youll be saying what his problem is i think its like inquisitive who was that youre early its not ready what happeneditll never happen youre in big trouble mister what kind of doctor are you do you think thats a good idea whats happening here mumford like the town sofie its so obvious youre after my daughter no you can not i wouldnt know who to say is calling just who is here can you tell me well look whos here take a hike dr quack

i dont know if i can quit were gon na try it together like you know aa or something and i made him give up his 22 no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune i said id consider it nobody owns me and the last thing was insane i dont know whats wrong with him no magazines what balls on this guy whatre we going steady jesus first off he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes i told him absofuckin lutely no as you can see he said which we already knew i mean doc the dude is seriously deluded i said that to him i said if you think im gon na do all that shit for you man you are seriously deluded no i dont know what he wants but i know i dont like being watched nobodys ever paid any attention to what i did and i liked it just fine where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself fuck him look in a mirror bozo theres this kid at school martin brockett he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares you wouldnt believe the crap he lays on me who appointed him my spiritual leader if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a 22 rifle and whys he spend all his time chasing after me probably thinks im gon na give him a hummer this shrink school you went to did you hear about it on an infomercial i dont think you know what youre talking about these appointments were not my idea remember what are you talking about i want to have the session i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me but i guess youre not into it which we already knew what are you doing were not done i just need to find the thing just chill for a second look at this guy it appears hes actually dead but gorgeous isnt she amazing that is such a wicked look its a really weird thing for a shrink to say and then you said maybe peopled be happier if theyd accept that some things dont change that itd be some kind of a relief or something i knew you wouldnt answer ive been thinking about what you said last time how me trying to lose weight and constantly not is like a lot of people with addictions how maybe i cant lose the weight ever which we already knew have women found you attractive where the new york times the first one was he handles produce well which we already knew the point is you have a lot of the signs fuck the community there was this article my friends and i read it was 25 signs hes great in bed it was very fascinating pro boner pro bono huh for whose good supposedly the school board doesnt pay you what kind of deal is that dont do that thing that shrink thing monthly god how shallow do you think brad is why do i waste my time telling you this stuff in maybe three or four issues so he already had the tattoo that said naomi forever and now theyre broken up see and he has to have it removed but while the scar is still healing or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed he meets chandra and its serious immediate love so in no time hes gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north americamother go away dr mumford does yes ive put myself completely in his hands for today anyway were going for a walk hello mother i want you to meet dr mumford of course i havent got the energy to get out of town that fast were only talking about six weeks you got off easy what is your name but first you have to tell me something oh i dont know depends im in a bad mood what but nothing im mad as hell this is a terrible thing youve done i am irate you deserve it you feel violated how violated i feel part of it we were watching er until someone called which show was that mother i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods i mean obviously it becomes much more likely that im going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make outsville and do all these highly romantic activities hello yes and that is what i have got right now i have taken my feelings of gratitude and relief and transferred them onto you i have taken all those warm grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you so that now i am under the delusion that i am in love with you transference i know a little about psychology i took three different courses in college its true none of them were above the two hundred level but i took them and there was one concept i remember very well the point is this i am not a blank page i did not just fall off the turnip truck do you know what i mean im saying that since im doing so much better which i attribute to you im liable to misinterpret some of my feelings given that im obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way first of all i have been feeling much better lately i dont know if the syndrome is over if its just run its course or something but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you all right im going to come right out and say this because thats what your shrink is for right so you can tell him whats bothering you no it is not something ive heard about you it is someth why is there something i should have heard about you how intuitive that must take years of training right there maybe you can guess what has upset me yes somethings very wrong dr mumford it mightve been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctorpatient relationship i need to talk to you doctor can i come in thanks to this therapy i now know what im looking for i need to find a man like you not one whos treating me of course and im going to do it dammit youve given me the confidence youre shockingly honest thats what makes you great ive never had a man treat me this way with you i feel really listened to can i tell you something its a little embarrassing but i feel very unguarded with you yes and my exhusband he never accepted me for who i was just like mother the things youve said have helped me understand what a dick he is i cant tell you how much i admire you you have a wonderful way with people and youre very insightful i feel like youve seen me clearly i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was youve made that possible for me youve been a tremendous help to me i bet i know what changed your mind my mother she was so horrible you decided you couldnt desert me my brother said you were about to fire me whyd you come to the house the other night which thing when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down and this is legitimate therapy its all right im thinking a gal could make a good living doing this how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old and hes where so whose route is this no thatd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end we went on for another year or so and ill bet you can interpret the whole thing that was really bad wasnt it who thinks theres nothing really wrong with me youre purposely making me talk while we do this because you think this is good for me and youre a sadistic bastard oh this makes me sound irrational which is probably right but there was something about him saying this it was maybe the millionth time hed told me about some preference of his well i was so tired of it seems like my whole life someones been telling me im just not getting it right can we rest for a second i dont know if im going to make it the whole way well then my life has been some kind of huge rip you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage is that like a party trick no not really theyre about the same my marriage was one long headache i dont know if i mentioned the headaches where yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused uhhuh well im tired all the time obviously i always feel like taking a nap but when i try to sleep i have trouble my muscles ache and my joints i feel like an old person or like i did back when i used to work out too hard what else im embarrassed the list is so long cause ill tell you none of the others have tried this approach is this the treatment no youve got a funny idea of funny what oh weve all disappointed her me especially but dad of course she thinks my brothers all right but she didnt expect much its what happens when you marry beneath yourself we dont discuss it is that the technical description of what ive got shes not in a bad mood shes like that all the time it doesnt bother me anymore its my dad and my brother i worry about moms such a cutie oh boy this should be interesting im not making any promises can i ask you something didnt you tell my dad you didnt think it was a good idea to come to the patient so what changed is it contagious cause everyone agrees my immune systems way down you have the best answer for everything you seem so hopeful are you always this sunny i dont think i can afford it i dont want my dad paying i dont know i barely made it today what would you do even if you dont think its real hmm is that a professional opinion no but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final thats not too suspicious is it but it wasnt like i was feeling bad about the divorce just the opposite thats okay maybe it is my mother always says everything thats wrong with you is in your head i suppose thats true i saw it i saw it in your eyes you think that now you think its a bunch of hooey dont you about six months ago i guess it is now god it seems like years what a bore im embarrassed by it before this happened when id hear people talk about this kind of thing i thought it was a bunch of bullshit oh lord its almost too exhausting to tell you about my exhaustion i didnt really want to come im not hopeful right now but i couldnt take the look on my dads face hes a truly kind person which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story hes the opposite of me i guess all stamina and resolve id better not ill fall right to sleep i think its too soon for me to be sleeping with youintestines oh yes always what just happened thats one way of putting it exactly im thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life in the necropolis when i saw him alive walking he called me anck sunamun and then in mister burns quarters he tried to kiss me and you think this justifies killing innocent people what is he doing here see the cartouche there its the official royal seal of seti the first im sure of it you put up with me because i can read and write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic and im the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library im sorry it was an accident do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years what are you doing here twenty yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent i would never three hundred pounds two hundred pounds i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life i am an english woman where are they taking him and what did he say and what is he in prison for yes i know and id like to keep them i have no choice got it i think you were jealous you called me your girl the creature are you sure im staying thats what i am to you a contract its everybodys problem according to that book once this creature has been reborn his curse will spread and as he grows in strength so will his curse grow infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed then well have to find some immortal ones alright then me i i read the book i woke him up and i intend to stop him no we are not we woke him up and we must try and stop him no we are not having an encounter with a four thousand year old walkingtalking corpse tends to convert one its just a book no harm ever came from a book yes they never used it because they feared it so its written that if a victim of the homdai should ever arise he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt according to my readings our friend suffered the homdai the worst of all ancient egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers in all of my research ive never read of this curse actually having been performed very slowly no ive never seen a mummy look like this hes hes still oh my god ive dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl no why should i why would i do that im not im going to kiss you mister oconnell i may not be an explorer or an adventurer or a treasure hunter or a gunfighter mister oconnell but im proud of what i am egypt is in my blood my father was a famous explorer he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian my mother who was quite an adventurer herself i know youre wondering whats a place like me doing in a girl like this no i believe if i can see it and i can touch it then its real thats what i believe you two how a key thats it thats what he was talking about quarried granite with a cobalt lining they didnt they buried him at the foot of anubis he was either someone of great importance or he did something very naughty oh my god it looks like it looks like a sarcophagus you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys for entering the afterlife oh my god its a preparation room ancient egyptian trick youll see according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living that thing gets me excited for what are you sure well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it oh thats comforting you know your history i dont believe in fairy tales and hokum mister oconnell but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there the book of the living its what first interested me in egypt as a child its why i came here sort of a lifes pursuit ahmar is ossirion passageway to the underworld actually yes im hoping to find a certain artifact a book actually my brother thinks theres treasure what do you think is out there did i miss something are we going into battle if you call that a kiss the only thing that scares me mister oconnell are your manners twentyfive percent and not one single farthing more yes could you tell me how to get there the exact location what did you find what did you see no i mean you swear yes well i know my brother you were actually at hamunaptra how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra no we uh found your puzzle box and weve come to ask you about it broad ah ah ahmenophus whats it look like finish the inscription idiot read the inscription on the cover shutup and get me off of here yes hes more than four thousand years old and still decomposing well neither do i thank you i cant believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk what do you suppose killed him its called mummification youre dead when they do this according to my calculations we should be right under the statue well come up right between his legs oh my after all you rode us night and day to win that bet personally i think hes filthy rude and a complete scoundrel i dont like him one bit do you really think hell show up but hes just a filthy criminal you stole it from a drunk at the local casbah im your sister you lied to me you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2134 bc yes the city of the dead where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all i think you found something jonathan oh no not another worthless trinket jonathan if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you well i wish youd do it sooner rather than later

youre afraid of him nigel cant you see hes using you is that what argon told you argon is a lunatic i cant believe i was stupid enough to believe i could control him you heard what he said nigel he doesnt care if all of calumet city is turned to jello how can that not affect you theres a guard outside my door im a prisoner nigel do you understand that opportunity i dont believe this is happening dr argon i know you want to use the nanobot on yourself but you mustnt the situation is critical right now the replicators are growing exponentially if we wait much longer it will be too late you have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown you were never invited to my house what ive always done as long as im the only one who can build the nanobot im the only one who can say when it should be tested i hope youre right id feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didnt care this day just keeps going from bad to worse the replicators theyll in validate the key probably nothing yeah but it wasnt a group it was one man they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at purnell labs im not sure thats the funny thing about him hes the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it yeah i knew him when i was still in school this morning i saw someone i havent seen in a long time what oh im sorry nigel i was just thinking things do change do you suppose that was our problem we met before our time i think that happens a lot people events planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place god what a fight that was god when we were in that store all i could think about was that one time when we were in school and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal do you remember that do the words hero fantasies mean anything to you how about infantile dementia youre not going after argon daniel just forget argon lets get out of here well find another way to stop the waste the same thing i suppose yes its too late argon injected it oh shit the meltdown its spread to the tower you dont have to say anything daniel im a scientist i know whats happening i recognize the classic symptoms dizziness shortness of breath sweating palms i can feel my adrenals secreting my parasympathetic nervous system quivering the estradiol coursing through my entire body did you think i could just leave you run daniel get out of here argons private lab oh no argon we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot we have to get the nanobot i didnt know what was going to happen i was just so worried something was going to happen to you i dont believe it youre here oh thank god youre not going back to jail all we need to do is find the nanobot once the meltdown is under control then we deal with argon oh no theyre trying to blame you for the accident that means they must not have been able to control the replicators who is he did you go sort of we used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers like a glove its a crime fighting costume what do you think its underwear so if you lose your clothes youll still be decent thats pretty good i was hoping you were over that remember to keep drinking fluids i think it would be better for me to go alone im sure sim is looking for you just sit tight ill bring you back a pizza something else i want to try im going to go out for a while i want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment i need how far can you stretch the nanobot its not here daniel i didnt hear you come down no problem probably the caffeine im glad you came to me for help just like old times come on i dont see you living in a cave and im sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world youre not protecting the world youre obstructing progress victim my ass you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved you have no one to blame but yourself whats that supposed to mean im sorry daniel but you have to admit its pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized its got to mean something the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate so whats wrong what about it what whats wrong is something wrong lungs sound fine you didnt have any preexisting physical conditions did you allergies infections i think while were waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you thats right with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else three days ago it was the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize the problem is the byproduct created by the process the nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a good year tire than a human being to put is simply the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger rna that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste if you dont want to do it this way i can remove it surgically the nanobot is still inside you its programmed to exit through the urinary tract we need it as soon as possible so swallow those mostly caffeine diuretics help you go to the bathroom what has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to calumet city if we dont hurry we dont have time for hysterics daniel once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure yes it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment i dont know my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse just like the mouse the nanobot sorry daniel im a physicist not a psychiatrist daniel what are you doing here daniel give him the trix youre insane im sorry i brought the whole thing up if youre gon na flip your wig weve had this conversation already daniel god daniel im not going to make agent orange well see what does that mean and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think it unifies the entire world on a single level everything is completely connected sometimes i can really feel it everything around us just a small part of a whole its really wonderful nothing really worthwhile well it was good to see you daniel but i have to be going it was a long time ago daniel we were young different people heading in different directions thats all and for cleaning up oil spills it already is i guess i should be flattered jesus daniel it wasnt rykers island it was work camp for white collar criminals the big house is that so same old daniel really what have you been doing when did you daniel okay barbie lets get this over with get him daniel knock his block off you wont thats why youre whispering just one question since dr argon no longer has feeling below his waist how is it that youre still able to do your job look as i have said and will continue to say the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority under the circumstances i cant fathom what makes dr argon think we are ready for anything bigger if cnn or hell if the epa knew what was in my basement i am aware of dr argons frustrations can i help you mrs argon what in the hell yes he might be yes that is what i was thinking it might be paranoia but ive never lost my keycard beforeshe knew what she was signing on for after all she took the money dont

it you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i called you names dont get me wrong im flattered that you chose me over her but please understand i never loved you sebastian youre just a toy a little toy i play with and now youve completely blown it with her i think thats the saddest thing ive ever heard cheers silly rabbit my triumph isnt over her its over you to my triumph of course well done not that its any of your business but yes id love to but unfortunately im expecting some company well done annette mind if i ask what youre doing in my room a little melodramatic dont you

you know how do you breathe when she sits on your face its embarrassing for you to be seen with her finally he couldnt take it anymore and decided to dump her she flipped and he went on the defensive i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again im completely fucked up im completely fucked up im completely fucked up poor fatty never had a chance how have you dumped girls in the past why so nervous then do me a favor and get rid of her if not for me then do it for you look at yourself youre a joke shes turned you into jelly what do you want to be one of those losers who

get their own wives pregnant and they certainly shouldnt be running around making slanderous accusations especially when certain young naive peoples mothers are paralegal secretaries at the citys biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits and if you want to keep questioning me like this i wont continue without my attorney present i dont know what youre referring to but i do know that if certain older and wiser people hadnt acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy everything would be okay why are you lecturing me well i dont know it could have been anybody there are

aisle i was walking toward somebody who didnt have any idea who i really was and it was only half the other persons fault because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted so it was good that i didnt go through with it because it would have been a lie but you you knew the real me i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things its something ive always wanted to do ive been making friends with your cat is it okay that im here so well im okay with that and the church yes you to who are you asking me i love you too me either okay so what uh

ill have the same fine the newspapers upside down thats better than fine even with everything thats happened ive still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress maybe you should ask her some time ever thought of that you dont know now thats romantic a proposal like that and you didnt find eternal bliss what went wrong so is that what you said to her what do you mean it was incredibly romantic it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life cal ripken even applauded hes an entomologist i thought it was very unique still sweet what an incredible chauvinistic observation no im not afraid just maybe someday maybe someday i think so its a birthday present for my cousin put your finger in sixfifty sevenfifty because i think youre writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical actually i meant you you probably got severance or expenses or both ill take your check no credit cards my point is that one again youre getting it all wrong that wont improve your reputation any and its not very flattering to me either so im going to give you a chance to write the truth youre welcome your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete you must be very proud how do i do it im not that beautiful you misinterpret everything weve all been friends our whole lives but thats the types of relationship you wouldnt understand youve been here for three minutes what did you do to her he is not give me that grandma made me the cutest outfit i cant wait to show it to you we think so without oxygen twice despite what you think i dont do it on purpose and i have no intention of doing it again id love to stay and chat but ive got to get back to work i still have my job youre going to be very disappointed did something happen to make you care about reality you have one yes nervous not at all no ive

hair its only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt its not anymore i think youre right is there anything i can do to make it up to you peggy theres distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up despite that i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory and i beg your forgiveness but im weird but you havent lost your mystery youre very mysterious because you think im all like hey man check me out im going to kill myself on anything male that moves as opposed to anything male that doesnt move thank you do you think i flirt with cory over there ten oclock hes talking to our little dennis dennis will turn into one of those sources say things there he is snoop doggydogg ya think thats what he says but if he thinks that i dont realize hes writing another article then hes an idiot okay hes on base can we talk about my life now ikes going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal that i was never serious about gill blah blah hes totally out to get me shes the boss reporter i didnt even need to change this gasket just put in a little hydraulic fluid yes ive seen it and i have to say its the rudest and most offensive joke anybodys ever played on me no its humiliating and youve been doing it since i was a kid i dont like it stop you may not like having a daughter with problems but guess what i dont like having a father whos drunk all the time ill eat in my room no its my life just stop it dont say another word like that thank you dad his name is skipper dad steady im not exactly having fun either

an actual fact for you maybe she hasnt read the paper you know its just possible that she hasnt read this yet no no youre her best friend you tell maggie and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isnt honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race before the rice hits the ground holy molyoh come on youre practically family you should thank lou and i for the wedding car a 63 buick your two cinnamon rolls the luau for maggie betty trout five dollarsyes rubbing your ears is very soothing cory does that to me when i hyperventilate his hair any color never say die make the shot dont be nervous maggie let us visualize remember what bob said be the ball bob is making her visualize the ceremony oh sure that was a long time ago see shes not a manhater at all shes very supportive of men this game is pretty important to him he made allstars in high school you know have you listened to his morning show wake up with ballplayer no shes talking about your hair yep maggie someone to see you and you are peggy phleming not the ice skater no about her getting that asshole from new york fired its been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie are you a reporter quick very quick wedding wedding you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row okay want to go to butchs for a drink or something you okay im closing lets go not eight

bob get your mind off the reporter lighten up wahine youre right its not funny now maybe we both grew up something that brings warmth to my heart duckbill platypus im not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that youre irreversibly screwed up but maggie youve been like this since we were kids and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts peoples feelings maybe its time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own like bob if hes the one no youre quirky quirky and weird are two different things no im weird weird and mysterious are two different things no i dont think youre like im charming and mysterious in a way that even i dont understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you very hard to compete with especially to us married women who have lost our mystery why i know i think sometimes you just sort of spazout with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves yes good morning to you too you look good he looks better with that stuff out of his hair hes an attractive man where not that he doesnt deserve to get fired look corys going for second sneaky its probably because you got him fired for what reason some personal satisfaction hold on nobody interviews maggie in here unless theyre getting haircut yup stop it when you talk like that i get turned on and it frightens me youre a goddess so mag youve seen this huh yeah no no you tell her what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar i cant ready anymorei i cant do this quickly close it ichabod what was that the church where are we going speak the words constable what is stopping you what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality call me a liar then and a murderess say it out and out if you think i am behind this say it yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them i have not been able to face him yet he did not do these things if you knew him you would realize when when you spoke fathers name along with accusations i could not believe it i had to hide these at least till i could confront him myself i have been reading your journal im sorry i found it too fascinating to resist i rode to catch up with you at the notary out of curiosity before i found you though i overheard what you were said what is so urgent im drawing bad blood from the wound the skull is gone my god what has happened what are you doing what did you say but i am not alone am i i only wished to see what you were up to and to thank you i apologize if i worried you it is only me if you want me to go i will do you want me to leave she died her lungs were diseased two years ago what is this about no but why do you ask that what what has happened the things i said to you before i was wrong to say them what troubles you you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it cant you see youll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it but why tell me why take a lesson from young masbaths desires ichabod crane he follows with you to avenge his fathers death that i understand but what do you want what is it then scientific method how can any of this matter in the slightest and this gives worth to butchery must i hear this what are you on about i have misjudged you i think i did not imagine you were so cruel why would you do such a thing wont they still have that justice or was it a vain promise people have put their trust in you you promised justice that would be a pity those words might show you something youve never seen before i insist that you have it then i also have a gift for you true magic which even you will not be able to deny oh you are hopeless may i keep it at least dont you see why look closely a moment put your intellect aside cant you see what is inexplicable you made this and the drawings yes he does may i try it would be interesting to find out these scars how did you get them you pay great attention to small things i hide these as i hide all my books father would not approve lest it were the bible you do not disturb me please stay having trouble sleeping you are funny really then what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom or even in a teardrop to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black not all think it is the horseman many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer offering death as tribute and still others believe none of it

my mothers bathroom in the bathroom in my mothers room the toilet was next to an old wooden table it smelled like that wood it was very specific that smell oh god sorry theo i think youve asked us

for her all night long and she woke up all the time and after she died well its been a few months but i still i still wake up its a habit i know weve only known each other a couple of hours but im really glad to be with people who let me talk about this im really happy to be here with you im really honored to be part of this study jim you can call me nell dr marrow why yes why who is there something about the house why do you need a chain like that im with dr marrows group im supposed to check in with mrs dudley up at the house is she here are you mister dudley the caretaker oh you scared me no one will come any nearer than that why would we well ive never lived with beauty you must love working here theyre so beautiful arent they mrs dudley oh theo you know i dont have an apartment just had to be sure theyre all in here all the ones he killed theyre just children we have to help them i dont think i want any but the painting this is real im not making it up theo you saw it you were there the banging and last night you you all saw the painting carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed because i dont want to ruin things because home is where the heart is what do you think i think so im trying have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid itd ruin things i dont know you know ill take that as a compliment in the city what kind of place do you live in im sorry i was mad at you theo red what else ive never had a pedicure before i dont know what to think anymore theres hundreds of them this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said why theo did you no its getting worse david david david watts can you hear us david daviiiiid whats his first name how could he have left without his keys yes i feel realy rested too theo you know it wasnt a joke theo good night theo yes ive missed it a monster but he built this for the woman he loved like the taj mahal i love this house i really love this house i know i dont have anyone but i do have a little apartment of my own it has a little flower garden you can just see the ocean at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the buoys in the harbor no ohh sure you have trouble with commitment not really im between jobs right now my last job it the person i was working for the job ended over so and you thats why were here i dont know what you mean its all i could afford fifteen dollars this its from a thrift shopnell was sure shed be in here nell will the two of you shut up god damn it maybe the tests were right marrow shes sensitive shes vulnerable but i dont think shes suicidal and i didnt have to test her maybe she wasnt trying to kill herself maybe she was really scared maybe she really heard voices maybe someday yeah that depends on your definition of ghosts im going to check on her and then im going to stay awake were fucked were in a haunted house and we cant get out until the morning mister very talky would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you no you could have he must have left didnt like the looks of the place or something luke and why didnt marrow tell us doesnt he trust women that fuck the rest of you may hate your insomnia but i find it the best time of the day for me im alone nobodys talking to me but myself my mind is racing with ideas and i can think but the experiment was a failure im not going back to new york city im going to find an apartment with a little flower garden where you can just see the ocean and at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the sound of the harbor what about you oh god we cant get out hes wandering around the house and nell heard him she thought it was ghosts lets go look for him again she needs help yes but i promised i wouldnt let her alone the whole night how could you do this to people its okay were all here maybe theyre marys well this is a cozy breakfast when do we take the tests no but nells been here longer than i have then lets go get you one whatd you come back for babe come on why are we waiting i do im going to stay with you until you fall asleep and then im going to get some brandy nell it makes sense it all makes sense you and i we were scaring each other working each other up nell what happened then who is come on nell deep down if you really thought it wasnt jim why wouldnt you be leaving right this second why wouldnt you be afraid really afraid marrow said the same thing as last night he says that he checked with mrs dudley and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney he says that he thinks that the flue was open and with the windstorm he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current okay are you sure my place isnt like yours nell it doesnt have a view of sea it doesnt have a view of anything whats interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls living with me my boundaries arent very well defined nell do you know what i mean you want to move to new york you want to move in with me i have a loft me too although i learned one thing about you that you dont know about yourself you can be a pretty decent bitch well just think about one thing right now what color well it wasnt me mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that hes in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and you said the good doctor was with you before he painted your name over mister crain thats so sad i dont know youve been alone for a long time maybe you want attention maybe he did it maybe you did it yourself is it over maybe he never came in if hed come in he would have left his bags at the door right or maybe he got here early and went for a walk and fell maybe hes outside david watts two sets i dont know maybe theyre not even his i guess oh your hair it looks good if this was some sort of joke im going to kill him you too happy tossing and turning no the world has missed you youve been out of the world for a long time havent you the taj mahal wasnt a palace it was a tomb why didnt he tell us youre okay jeez a blank canvas i could paint your portrait directly on you or maybe not so you husbands boyfriends girlfriends where do you live my boyfriend thinks so my girlfriend doesnt if we could all live together but they hate each other its hard to be miss perversity when youre the only one at the party dyou know what i mean dont tell me boston is different from new york that depends what do you do dont worry i probably wont be in here much light sleeper wait youre not wearing that ironically this is really you thatd be seventy in new york you stole it what did it cost and what youre wearing thats great toowhy not we think just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time nothing i guess its hard to pass on this road ive lived in la all my life ive never done this drive hey i thought you werent a buffet person it mustve been a time a golden moment i like the colors not who food should we get italian italian italian oh god for some eating is a sensual experience the sensual experience you demand to be served a fork fetishist like you why what kind of food its an observation like im hungry when are we eating its not a knock no youre not specific enough to be a person youre more like a vibe well youre certainly not a person im loyal to things that make me happy is that a problem then what good is he i want to know why you need that scary guy in your house i used to hate it now i like itid rather be with him than without him i dont want to be found dead in la hard to miss no but i know what he means you just cooking then well those are the breaks really probably uhhuh not much you youre just on a higher plane wilson poor baby friends and colleagues how do you know whats in big sur i could use a vacation of course i keep forgetting for you this is a vacation i dont know few hours i guess up the coast she never would have turned you in not in a million years still you could never do what she wanted she told me you were a ghost in her life daddy the friendly ghost coming back to haunt her a leech on the welfare state in addition you dont miss a trick minor officials bother you dont they wont he be looking for you about now i guess youre just habitual whatd your father do he alive to see this what about your grandmother stick with me kid looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes yeah well youre here now where h urricanes h ardly ever h appen only in the movies they want southern i do southern they want midwest i do midwest they want tall blonde and twentytwo im shit out of luck one thing i cant do is english americans cant shouldnt even try and laurence olivier couldnt do us pushing the legal limit even then i dont believe it you have been away or is all this just new to you overnight what about just now who remembers i was inside once i punched a cop at a demo from pursuing your chosen profession it didnt discourage you though you mean if theyd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess what did you do to make them take the early 70s away from you still there have been rewards its sunny and some of the producers who call even have credits its too involved a lifetime of non involvement anywhere else id be an interesting little number here im just sag number fortyeight thousand and one sag meaning screen actors guild you dont know how ive compromised my standards these more highlights from the zagat prison guide this towns been chewing my flesh since what we now refer to as the early 70s christ my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me you think terry gave me access to her things probably sold her clothes shed never called me like that before she sounded more pissed off angry than upset or afraid but she never turned up i called the house but only got the answer machine when they found her shed been going the wrong way not the direction shed have gone if shed been coming to see me or coming straight to see me who knows maybe she just wanted to drive jenny was supposed to come to my place that night she called me asked if she could come over she and terry had been having some trouble lately i dont know about what on this occasion it reached some sort of crisis point theres the phone you want his number on what what makes you so certain terrys never going to give you satisfaction not the type you dont believe it was a car accident you fuckin guys and your dicks are you serious so whats the deal you and terry valentine at twenty paces is that what this is about when he wants someone run down youre willing to do it for him in what capacity are you employed by this mr lindgren right i thought you said you never did an honest days work in your life i bet i see what line is he in whos mr lindgren your employer lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing like me but on a grander scale of failure do you even know who terry valentine is thats what was estimated where you get your bank statements whats that like a po box the address jenny gave me that wasnt a prison was it were you still married at the time to jennys mother i mean i gave him yours said here you want to write i think this is a relative i guess i thought i was being true to jenny who told me she didnt have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why i should really give him a call hes a character isnt he well not to you i meant to us squares in the outside world and youve seen eddie rama i mightve been away for the weekend you havent been lurking outside my building all day when did you get in she was happy here however the two of you might have parted dont think she wasnt she was twentyone when she came to me straight from leaving you you werent disappointed in her then modelling when im not honing my craft in episodic television i do doubleduty as a voice coach not that her accent would have hobbled her progress not with that look she never told anyone else about the convict strain or is it stain no i was privileged i was someone who helped jenny efface her past disappointed not ashamed not embarrassed im sorry i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went it mustve been the bars now whos being sarcastic three seasons they found thats the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail i was wife number three the ingenue if it played in england somebody owes me money who told you that eddie sarcastic moi maybe ill mellow when my ship comes in its expected any day now im all packed and ready to go sounds like beverly hills try calling me again well that kind of security cant be bought must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out from the wembley staduim job wasnt it pink floyd concert receipts jenny wouldve been fourteen at the time in any case i dont suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel i heard you were whats that adorable phrase at her majestys pleasure thats not what i heard its been a while been busy have you no why did you come here why did you come here not her brand you look alikei we have to bury leon tommorrow you wouldnt understand i dont know everyones dead on once once what are we you going to do my parents flew back from

broken down leon saw it like you assumed i was there thought hed wait to ask for a lift but carlos turned up with the tape you found leon got his lift and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out he watched it confronted carlos threatened to tell the police about the hotel i dont know how he knew about the hotel perhaps carlos talked too much my husband did not tell me you more or less guessed the rest i didnt know any of this before you left for los angeles leon could still have hung himself ifif my car is there i could be the one who why dont you accuse me

oh yeah better be good and hurry away then who knows we might be being watched maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life after all thats what they do to their employees isnt it huh hope you enjoy ruining peoples lives thanks for the lift oh no im all right he was a jerk really another boy you know all i meet is boys when i think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls i mean is it true oh we split up so you havent seen the film then i dont know how many famous french film directors can there be la collectionoose its about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her its on tv tonight and as im in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and the review says its about the conflict between intellect and instinct and witty the directors supposed to be famous rommel or something french you must know him have you heard of a french film called la collectionoose yes but my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company for expenses and all that you know itd cost you about 100 but he said itd be worth it of course youd need a partner to register but thats a formality i mean i could be your partner i mean just as a name right must be your lucky day then ive got your accounts you dont owe much tax for last year fine how was the match did you loose hello again neighbour i didnt intrude did ijah 10000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel deborah will be here if you need anything before our return ha no mr lombard his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate we are aware of your rates mr lombard we will pay you double your rates plus expenses in return need i say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention the 1000 is on account when im told he came here the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about his address is in this envelope with leonards address keys and other things you might need no and before you ask no hes not gay he has had girlfriends but nothing serious he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it yesterday it all looked normal then you should not have sought an explanation i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account do what mr lombard you wouldnt be here if i knew mr lombard what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now leonard what my daughter is on about mr lombard is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian you might as well know that what i can appreciate is insolence mr lombard good now as i trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us someone whose discretion can be relied upon someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment do you think you could be that person mr lombard you may not and besides it is irrelevant must i speak to you in french whatever you come recommended we what if it is lombard this is not a jewish name is it may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard spitz we spoke on the telephone my husband my daughter deborah whose house this is my soninlaw carlos the gentleman is a business partner of hislooks like at the end of the day we finally find out whos better than who dont we epps like i said i expected more from you give it to me if i dont answer hell know somethings up i have to answer him theyll kill you you wont make it ten feet before they cut you down thats just what things came to sometimes you cant help that it doesnt change me respecting you and now you let me down i expected more from you you know i really did i expected you to you disappoint me epps always figured you to be a man a real bright guy i had respect for you thanks for taking care of this for me look i know you guys are telling the truth its just the shiites dont know that i guess you could tell thembut then you dont speak the language do you sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with in the flack jacket still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat took the air right out of me but i was just unconscious for awhile course you didnt stick around to find that out you left me for dead nothing about him unless hes got a problem about me dealing with you then i suppose itd be insurrection and i suppose id have to kill you i suppose im the ones got the big stick without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge no navicom a lot of good you are now epps what if i do in the service you do but were not particularly in the service right now way i see it what were doing that doesnt particularly give you the right to toss orders around youve got an awful lot of orders in you always giving orders get out of my way then step aside its a combat action im not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you dont have the stomach to do what has to be done he tried to kill us if not just now then in the helicopter thats all the authority i need were at war hes an enemy soldier you dont know he isnt thats what he says he could be a spy or something we cant just leave him hell run back to his outfit report our position i dont care what he says he wanted our gold would have slit our throats if he had the chance hehe could have been watching us says he wanted food liar he wanted the gold says they were deserters they were afraid to fight dont believe in saddam anyway they flew the gunship up here to hide out when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first i told you dont push me around i told you he tried to steal our gold he tried to kill us he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i wasnt sleeping would have slit our throats if i hadnt stopped him you got no reason to hit me im getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around you got no reason to do that maybe i dont need your ideas maybe i can do better on my own maybe youve got ideas of your own for the gold maybe youve already got things worked out youre the one with all the ideas what if we get separated way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share maybe we should split it up now what about the gold you ready ready when you are epps what am i supposed to do missile and they cant fly around out there forever weird they didnt chase us whered they go otherwise whatever were looking for could be anywhere what do you figure it to be the us army always an adventure probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here worn down to nothing now and find the treasure and get it and get back to the humvee and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off but thats about it we cant just go off and we can fight thats what were here for to fight the iraqis to help the shiites and the khurds the soldiers are going to kill those people yeah should have at least gotten the map off of him blows up with him then we did all this for nothing what if its a valloro 69 just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us for climbing should have blown already delayed fuse thats vietnam stuff what kind of mine hes an idiot and hes not nearly as hard as he thinks not much chance of that jaegers an idiot him getting us stranded out here doesnt do much good either what are you doing deserters would have run they wouldnt have engaged we shouldnt have been here epps there is a war going on oh jesus theyve stopped they stopped what are we going to do no please not again id settle for being alive really alive would be fine what oh god youre out of your minds you know that both of you you dont even know if theres anything out there what the hell are you thinking damn this is sweet we are going to be home in no time its a map i think thats what it is whats it say paper well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say its a box i didnt learn arabic because we were getting shipped here you dont learn it in a couple of weeks i studied it in high school and its very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone its considered offensive think were going to do it think were going to war you actually got around to killing someone im impressed i guess youre only half a bitch when my shiite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic turns out weve been kicking ass in this little war they figure weve finally gotten saddam off their backs they brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me im their new best buddy america number one joe but theres something the shiites cant figure out they cant figure out why my two buddies two fellow americans left me out in the desert they cant seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost its almost as if they were iraqi spies or something and ive got to tell you they hate anything thats got to do with the iraqis see how i mean probably shot a few scattered the rest murderers the white reflects the sun it keeps you cooler thats why they wear them you want to say some words hed just slow us down and drink our water and if we ran into any more iraqis you know hed sell us out im not wasting my water on him all last night he could have been says hes one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter hes a soldier he doesnt need a weapon hes got rocks hes got bare hands what the hell are you doing what do you see you down its got a bottom what do you think just seems weird they didnt chase us we make it or we go back empty handed youre the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad were american soldiers we dont abandon people we have to do something is there anything you do know those people down there are shiites youve got shiites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north neither of themve got much love for saddam probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some im getting tired of you riding me jaeger if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself you want to crawl crawl havent found a mine for half a mile or more how long we going to keep this up doesnt matter were not going to be able to get him off it anyway really what is that an order private you two dont even know how crazy you are you want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent then lets go back while we still can so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere we just about got killed you know what happened we just about got killed and you want to go on we have to go back we got to get out of here i thought we were dead i think im going to throw up i am im going to toss oh jesus oh god this is too much you dont even have the money and youre wasting it if theres gold if how the hell should i know how much i dont know it would be small easy to transport and hide gold or jewels probably gold if if theres a treasure oh no were going to get court martialed you know that god i dont believe im doing this i dont youre insane if you think youll find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive epps youre smarter than this jaeger i understand but youre smarter so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase its crazy tell him its crazy epps its not a hundred miles its a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain pure desert mountains a river if the map is even real you dont know where the iraqis have moved to and our forces havent even engaged the republican guard yet we dont know youre not saying what i think youre saying i cant believe youre even thinking it what those soldiers have got loafers on what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers its a container break the seal the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer itii be for us when we have to engage this is so weird its happening but its not its like a tv show and were part of it you ever think about it you ever worry you ever think about dying jaeger why would they do all that if we werent were going to war arent we if theyre doing all that it must mean were going to war theyre cancelling all leaves all passes no more drills we stand at full ready starting thats in two days you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait jaeger you really think theres a treasure inside you will youll get it you get it yet and youre the guy whos going to open it its a puzzle box if you can figure out how to open it theres supposed to be a treasure inside he says its a box now you need me dont even try it you offend a woman out here youre in serious trouble dont shoot me im friendly you can use that when you surrender i thought it would be good to know im just trying to help you guys out it doesnt hurt to know something about saudi arabia come on youre going to get us in trouble im saying dont do it accidently people were suffering in afganistan and we didnt do anything i dont think well go to war we shouldnt even be here this isnt our fight its a regional conflict it should be decided regionally yes yes thats exactly it yes yeah a headache my head hurts youre making me uncomfortable could you stop please youre giving me a headachethey dont even realize they should be frightened here mr tyler he claims a certain skill at handling firearms well see fine ill stop i try please if you promise to protect me ill testify against him ill
