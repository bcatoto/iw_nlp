how do you know that we can prove that youre not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too wheres the cabin why didnt you tell us all this in the first place mueller was alone in the cabin back up what about the phosphorous grenade where what business he said he worked there epilepsy tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you he was your friend your phone number yeah a word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss probably not the best time to hit on them nah go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened what are you doing out here yeah i can wait till youre off the base and do it myself nobody saw but i dont think so far as im concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past youre a good man hardy thats not true what if i dont want it this isnt the time what we need to talk no bodies no west hardy for chrissakes hardy what are you doing we got maybe three minutes till they break it down four no we were close to something with kendall for what you know you never told me why you left the army think itll work so what now so did i you wanted to break him you mean the falsely accused you wanted to get the truth you couldnt have known see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission good idea positive hardy they planned this what kendall said the type of guys you dont feel comfortable going to sleep around thats what dunbar said about childs to the letter they got their stories straight little bit so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senators son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber buttfucks the cabin so its a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent dunbar talk it through childs mueller and nunez know theyre going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it kill west pin it on pike at least you and kendall agree on that what because its my job because people are dead because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that we can do this hardy but you will i was starting to believe you you know that you werent who everyone said i guess i was wrong you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal you said you owed styles and now youre gon na turn your back on him goddammit hardy you cant just leave styles couldnt reassign him hes a legend i dont know look all weve got is what kendall says and he didnt actually witness any deaths except nunez he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies he didnt see any crime committed i just he came back for kendall i dont think hes capable of murder i dont think that has anything to do with but we have to question him thought you didnt have cigarettes that was kid gloves remember hes the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves not the happiest of memories something wrong what point imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar youre off to a late start you do understand that theres absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about isnt it youre kidding something like that you typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up what is that were in the middle of a murder case you really want to make banal chit chat like that now you made me look like an idiot baseball the colonel saw you shoot nunez youre a murderer i questioned him for three hours and he didnt make a sound you dont have a badge he wont talk to you good copbad cop that is the most unprofessional excuse me why yes kendall junior is still in surgery so he wont be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet were talking to first is dunbar senator jonathan kendall of ohio hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall wording and your friendship with the colonel aside im not comfortable having you involved in this youre the tom hardy ive been reading about in the papers right new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres you and the colonel go back sergeant wests served for twenty three years hes the public face of the modern army you knew sergeant west hostile and uncooperative what happened with nunez so you framed him the same way childs was going to frame pike who levi wrong answer what enjoy your flight to washington it will and you know why because youre not a person anymore youre a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights so im gon na throw you to the wolves and unlike you im gon na get away with it because youre pissing me off it doesnt matter levi were going to find those bodies and when we do im going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon you and dunbar got your stories straight little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you you think youre just going to slide out of this youre an accessory to murder levi youre going to jail dunbar says you were pike never confessed fifty minutes pike never confessed but you didnt see it right nunez was chasing dunbar no one else heard it he said what he couldnt kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own we just want so no no that was cadet dunbar yeah you never told me why you got kicked out of what happens to dunbar now we know he tried to burn dunbar to us you dont do that if youre not involved its too neat no search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup if theyre hurt and we can get to them in time hes not army its not official but this guy you called hes not even army this is totally unnecessary lucky girl i know go please go just go its okay just leave it i wont be selling you this house mr bloom i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference im not convinced you should be happy then i dont think so mr bloom if nothing is going to change id just as soon it not change in the way it hasnt been changing all this time so ive heard no one would come out here unless they had business and no one would have business with me except for you youre buying the town you must be edward bloom promise me youll come back how are you gon na make it without your shoes and when im 38 youll be 48 and thats not much difference at all im eight that means when im eighteen youll be 28 and when im 28 youll only be 38 how old are you its not a woman its a fish no one ever catches her was she nekkid what did she look like well therapy and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back i was living in a fairy tale no its logical if you think like your father see to him theres only two women your mother and everyone else look i dont know how much you want to know about any of this you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it especially this late in the game can i ask you a question why did you come here today if you found this deed why didnt you just ask eddie wow wow you just said it i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time everyone in town knew him i am and youre will ive seen your picture thats how i recognize you i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward like this i wasnt expecting you oh ohi like your stories you were talking about your wedding is it the medicine thats making you thirsty i thought you said you didnt have a church wedding oh so this is a tall tale i never knew please can i take your picture stop no i understand thats terrible what were you dreaming about hi how are you feeling really i do im sorry it seems every hour i have to i need to lie down for a bit ill help you i spent a week in morocco for the story it was incredible yes your father had a stroke hes upstairs with your mom and dr bennett i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him youre not but its not true do you love him do you love your father mmm what but its romantic what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that you never told me how your parents met i talked with your father last night im going with you im going with you you need to go its badi see we need to get you one of those plant misters we can spray you like a fern how can i convince you to stop you dont even know me how did you get so many daffodils but youre wrong i do know you at least by reputation edward bloom from ashton see im actually engaged to a boy from ashton don price he was a few years older than you im sorry i loved it it sounds peculiar but i loved every minute of it i did eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me a little part of his soul inside me i could feel it it was alive and kicking do you like it being pregnant i know it was the same when i was carrying will like clockwork im going to check on him im going to get started on dishes well have to pick up a copy down the hall on the right the door sticks you have to really pull it thank you ill bet you need to yes thank you thats okay i dont suppose one of us could stay with him in case he in case he wakes up one of us should be there heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place i suppose your grandmothers house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it yes he just fell asleep josephines with him not everything your father says is a complete fabrication do you know who that is was she one of your teachers before i forget your father has papers in the basement id like you to go through i wouldnt know whats important well clearly you dont but im not the mystery youre trying to solve right now i know its not easy just remember he didnt choose to be your father and you didnt choose to be his son you just ended up together you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and itd be just the same if you ask me its a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someones wife and ive been his wife longer than ive been your mother you cant discount that no its not its exactly the same your father and i met we dated and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level just the same as you two would you say you understand josephine yes will i do and dont presume things you dont know yes of course really thats wonderful you dont talk about those things not yet hes impossible he wont eat and because he wont eat he gets weaker and because hes weaker he

anger sort of way after glenn was finished he gave me a couple of valiums and i went home the next day i finished my shift and met him around back like we always did i stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest three or four times shit what was that guys name i really liked him then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off he said he was going to fuck some sense into me sort of i was telling him about this great love of my life whos name i dont remember and i could see he was getting pissed i thought it was just because he was worried about me but he told me that i was stupid because my boyfriend didnt really love me no we never got busted we were done with a shift one night both a couple of percocets down and i was telling glenn about my boyfriend about how we were thinking about doing it you know i was thinking about letting him be my first because i loved him what the hell was his name

turner im a maid in the governors household because its what youre searching for youve been searching for it for years i recognize this ship i saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from england ill drop it very well i want you to leave and never come back captain barbossa i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal well i am not going to stay hidden in some cabin or i suppose its going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage then i can wear mens clothing what not as a condition a request commodore i beg you please do this for me as a wedding gift commodore please no the pirates have taken will he can locate isla de muerta but i doubt hell be willing to help us from the brig commodore you cant do that yes im all right im fine go capture him commodore i must protest pirate or not this man saved my life i cant breathe his name is will turner thats all i found out boy overboard i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate about the day we met do you remember women in london must have learned to not breathe difficult to say i knew it ceremony its beautiful may i inquire as to the occasion yes yes yes father actually i find it all fascinating tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete parlay i invoke the right of parlay according to the code of the brethern set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew you must take me to your captain it doesnt there and dont you dare tell me that wasnt a proper kiss i guess you can never truly know someone elses heart then we never would have met to keep it away from them no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock truthfully you were a bit late will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth whats your plan these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly can not be killed he might delay the rescue and that would be too late you didnt tell commodore norrington everything exactly that signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction the entire royal navy is out to sea looking for me do you think there is even a chance they could miss it one because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels two yes the rum is gone to freedom mr sparrow im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again youll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main well perhaps with a bit more to drink i might that was before i met one of course oh no its silly back in england we didnt know a thing about pirates really they seemed so romantic and daring nothing its nothing just im reminded of a song i learned as a child a song about pirates drink up me hearties yo ho not when you can drink instead at least a month will doesnt have a month weve got to do something to help him so thats it thats the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow you spent three days on the beach drinking rum but you did it before last time what whats wrong how will this help us get off the island captain sparrow we have to get off this island immediately has it changed since the last time you were here come on youre in league with barbossa you you are despicable miss swannthen we just have to make sure everyone who knows cant say anything i thought you wanted zammito theyre supposed to be evidence thats why bastaldi set this up listen we know their names they dont know the city youll find them youre the fbi zero thats all i know black market art zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum the bastaldis supplied the artists to make copies of famous works theyd switch the paintings send the originals to paris and the bastaldis would sell them to private collectors laurant and vincent were in business with zammito i dont know i know they wont be home tonight no 145 ridgeroad way yes no i didnt you can use my car theres an exterior alarm system theres also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector the control panel is in the bedroom they dont have a wine list vincent bastaldi is in jail stick around and find out after last night i could say the same for you sounds boring what are you doing im sorry things went so wrong today cant sleep the lucky ones ive been thinking about getting tattoo you know a flower or something on my ass sorry i didnt mean to pry

bored ive missed you no you couldnt roam around freely if you were youre not married are you you know what i mean im getting married soon but i havent lived the life i want but youre just like the characters in the stories ive read all about people like you roaming wild beating up anyone who gets in your way it must be exciting to be a fighter to be totally free really youre a sword fighter too li mu bai the famous warrior why would he give his sword to sir te exquisite you said it belongs to but i have had much practice as a child in the west a platoon lived with us theyd let me play with their weapons the scabbard is so beautiful its heavy for such a thin piece of metal the antidote exists she taught it to me the formula is simple but it takes time to prepare trust me as you have helped me let me help you never give it back all right if you can take back the sword in three moves ill go with you what do you want only the sword will settle this not another lecture on guard make a wish lo do you remember the legend of the young man dont ever come back go if you dont ill come after you and i wont let you off so easy keep it safe return it to me when we are together again dont send me back let them look so youre still that little boy looking for shooting stars and so the little boy became a fearsome bandit he couldnt find the stars so he stole my comb give it back give me back my comb by the way im a real manchurian its mine it means a lot to me a barbarian like you wouldnt understand you coward my comb give it back you shouldnt have come loi didnt have the heart li mu bai is coming to stay the night hows the arm still sore take my horse and go to the compound give this to mrs wu shell help you hurry you cant die tell us what poison you used you cant die tell us the antidote you cant let li mu bai die without the green destiny you are nothing dont touch it thats li mu bais sword how dare you accuse us i always knew you had stolen the sword ive done nothing but protect you and your family and youre repaid me with nothing but contempt li mu bai himself spared you and all you do is insult him we wanted some peace and youve ruined it all youre no sister of mine li mu bai has made arrangements he sent him to wudan mountain he really loves you come back to peking with me well find a solution go back to them first then you can decide about lo look at the trouble youve caused now you know what giang hu life is really like if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice you can run from marriage but not your parents ill give them to you here you must be in proper attire yes from the west he went undercover and and followed her here then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a womans duties his name was meng si zhao he was a brother to li mu bai by oath one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bais enemy after li mu bai and i went through a lot together our feelings for each other grew stronger but how could we dishonor mengs memory so the freedom you talk about i too desire it but i have never tasted it yes did you know i was once engaged to be married do you think so let me tell you a story you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family thank you for seeing me i hear your wedding day is near you must be overwhelmed by the preparations you write gracefully calligraphy is so similar to fencing youre doing calligraphy how so youre probably right what do you think so i heard congratulations its the most important step in a womans life isnt it sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we wouldnt survive for long yes i am but i prefer the machete certain moves however call for a sword youre too young to understand my friend li mu bai hes given it to sir te as a gift beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire its 400 years old the handle is heavy and the blade is no ordinary metal still the sword is the lightest of weapons youre just not used to handling it use it to meditate free yourself from this world as you have been taught let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath do not waste it for me save your strength mu bai hold on give me some hope that cant be everything has an antithesis why not this we followed jade fox what happened not a bad idea tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters what about you to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger not everything is an illusion my hand wasnt that real dont you want to see her again you think jade fox will show up i wish there were something more i could do to help you its not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object but wudan does not accept women shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us in any case it will all be over soon youll kill fox and shell marry i knew she would intrigue you my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers but its not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te then why did you come what do you mean didnt you come back here for it no id already sent them home you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods no not yet it was bo sir tes man i hear he followed the thief to the yus no be careful sir te requires discretion official business is difficult enough dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu you always suspected shed fled to the west but something is going on at the yu household join me once you have finished i can wait for you in peking come with me to peking you can give the sword to sir te yourself itll be just like old times so what will you do now you use it justly youre worthy of it i dont understand how can you part with it it has always been with you the green destiny sword youre giving it to sir te were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking what was it you were enlightened why youre a wudan fighter training is everything the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain he said you were practicing deep meditation good and how are you mu baiits been too long i doubt it this thief it very unusual yes the very killer of li mu bais own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter we must be careful governor yu is a court official and in charge of security any disturbance will cast suspicion on him it might get sir te in trouble but the sword could be in his compound has governor yu ever seen the sword i beg your pardon li mu bai and i arent cowards i dont know please sir te what is it youve always been so good to li mu bai and me please accept our thanks sir te it has brought him as much trouble as glory help him to leave these troubles behind otherwise hell never be able to start anewof course shes in on it too dont let her see you

youve done it all god ive missed you and principal collins youll be pleased to know that this year wednesdays are south of the border days well serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadillai have to save eugene what did you see speed up another premonition what did you see what am i looking for i dont think so alexs premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it six duds in a row are you crazy what makes you think youd survive what are you doing youre going to kill us how you doing in there hero so lets do it please what else could it mean then it wasnt just a sign it was a premonition you were there you have to tell us now i hope youre ready for this i didnt beat it i hid from it if you were smart youd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you know it dont make new friends dont fall in love and dont ever bother trying to save others thats the worst killer of them all thats what alex used to ask himself right up until if you have the same power as alex youll be seeing signs soon when you see anything creepy or ominous an inyourface irony kinda thing dont ignore it it usually means the difference between life and death thats good get all your tears out now youll need your eyes for the signs congratufuckinglations that makes you last to go but dont worry once the others are dead itll come back for you always does the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash that was deaths original design deaths list the precise order youre going to die in well if you put them on the list theyre already tits up nice work maybe if youre real lucky youll wind up in here with me but i doubt youll survive that long yeah how kimberly burroughs eh what do you want she had the baby a guard grabbed me before i could find eugene if only alex and i had done that with the others alex might still be we need to hurry make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight holy shit he said only new life can defeat death if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born a brand new soul that was never part of deaths design he probably already knows were coming a mortician he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us thats why death is working backwards its tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited being alive after our time caused an outward ripple a rift in deaths design your entire world view just went out the window i couldnt expect a religious conversation overnight well get through this i promise random sure what about you kimberly did you anyone from flight carter what about the rest of you kimberly you were driving to daytona was route 18 your first choice the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winningsno it cant be i was dead and came back to life an eeg machine wheres eugene yeah fuck em no offense what do you want me to do yes i was in a hospital there was screaming a nurse was choking me i couldnt tell what she looked like but the name tag was right in my face kalarjian no its not here this one was different more like the pile up and the van going into the lake this makes no sense isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested and when it was rorys turn to die and thomas was in the way what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn no if anyone dies from a crash now itll be me but i cant die if eugene and isabella are still alive im last on deaths list what about that so if you give us the pregnant ladys number we can warn her about the lake and shell live long enough to have the baby i can practically taste the water in my throat and something else the smell of flowers i was driving a white van it mustve gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned it washorrible ii the second one just dies a 16 year old kid how can you say that what kind of monster are you the songs on the radio but wait i dont understand why is this even happening to me signs that still doesnt make sense you said you die in the same order you were originally meant to but evan shaeffer died last in my premonition not first officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends exact order then im next i was meant to die with my friends so im next what list its not just about me someone i saved died last night in a freak accident what if the others are in danger too i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up i saved some people and now i think death is after me i thoughti thought you might be able to help me for gods sake leave him alone dad welcome back we did it for real you cant cheat destiny i know what i have to do to save us i have to die im not sure i dont think isabella was ever destined to die in the pile up i dontwhat if i made a mistake i know how it feels to be dead shouldnt we pull over i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death dont worry nothing can happen to us he cant breathe damn it i think his lungs collapsed how do you know are you thinking what im thinking how are we going to find her there must be thousands of white vans in this state it throws the entire death list out of whack and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch we all start over with a clean slate yeah i thought he was supposed to be helpful this is cheery we have to tell her shes in danger turn around the cleaning woman said theyre at the dentists 14th and main theyre next on the list we have to find them pigeons its a sign if clears right about the order then nora and tim are going to be attacked by pigeons clean up i dont then you believe all this that death is working off a list evan shaeffers dead my premonition was just like his billboards about accidents kids yelling pile up for no reason it all feltjust wrong just like the log truckand everybody i guess everyone was driving like a maniac and somehow i knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did like i said it was like i was there i remember everything the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shainas face youre not listening to me you have to do something thats the truck thats going to kill everyone theres going to be a pile up logs bodies everywhere i saw it happen it happened highway to hell highway to hell theres going to be a huge accident everyones gon na die all of us i saw it theres going to be a huge accident everyones gon na die all of us i saw it whats the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona i can live with thaaaa this trip better be worth it whats the guygirl ratio again no im good i guess so ii dont know sure i dont know whats weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance more than that all the songs on the radio were about car crashes some kids banging toy cars together she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on his car was leaking oil all over the road i used to have those feelings too but thats when id think of mom her strengthand courage and id pray that maybe id grow up to be as brave as she was and the bad thoughts would go away i love you too dad goodnight that its not over yet i know its crazy but im really scared for the others ive got this terrible feeling i will dad bye luv you you got it dad ill call you if i have a problem hey dad whats up i know dad i know this is the first time weve been apart since but everythings gon na be okay relax dad its daytona not mongolia thanks dad ill call youill miss you ok bye well have a good flight youre leaving right now just
