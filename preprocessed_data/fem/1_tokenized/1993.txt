every time i tell you that i love you you flinch but thats your problem drugged is a stupid word hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but im not in this for whooping cranes im in it for cowgirls if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised looks like every time we get together things are in a mess from men the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect men have drained the cranes marshes stolen its eggs invaded its privacy polluted its food fouled its air blown it apart with buckshot i wouldnt say that i expect shes right ultimately but im with delores when it comes to fighting for whats mine i cant understand why delores is so uptight about the chink he could probably teach her a thing or two ee that grass tickles doesnt it god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits still this is cowgirl territory and ill stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it i guess ive always been a scrapper look this scar only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they mustnt resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age shes a real dreamer that debbiedear delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision hasnt happened niwetï½kame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools tension cowgirl tension what a drag learned from the chink oh my ha ha thats hard to say we mostly uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth its not original its something i picked up from the chink no maam no way theres girls on the rubber rose who are political but i dont share their views i got no cowgirl ideology to expound politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it cowgirls exist as an image a fairly common image the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail otherwise theyre being fooled in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls two and both of em are trickriders trickriding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks thats what prostitutes call it you know tricking about well that doesnt matter that part never interested me anyway the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichï½s and the clap but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl oh i know about sissy hankshaw all right ive done a little hitchhiking myself ah shucks thats like telling annie oakley youre a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone id heard tales about you from people id meet in jail cells and truckstops i heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and i heard how you were jack kerouacs girl friend welcome podner by god its great to have you here its an honor sorry i took so long getting to you but weve had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to dohow am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard but thats an old story now i cant believe that you would leave the butte she had a one wayticket to kansas city the countess has come to our aid the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls and i have been asked to oversee the ranch for 300 a week and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was heres a picture is everything getting worse what do you believe in then then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink the clock people siwash huh clockworks what was that but i dont know how to polka oh well theres been some trouble on the ranch i came up here to get out of the way its so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down if you could help im a friend of bonanza jellybeans where are the others you might say that although i dont think of it as traveling well no i dont reside anywhere in particular i just keep moving i dont im staying with the countess if i flinch when you say you love me its both our problems my confusion becomes your confusion students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains its made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years no i guess not how did this business get started anyhow why are the birds nesting here so be it it looks serious this time though all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes thats jellybean you dont agree with debbie then what is debbies position really the chink huh ive gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink youre political then about being a cowgirl whats it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl tell me about it no im afraid that part isnt true jack was in awe of me and tracked me down we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover besides i always travel alone er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast my thumbs hurt ive made a mistake ive been negligent i havent exercised i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what its like a musician practicing his scales when i dont practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore i have to go julian getting dressed ive got to go its not the air conditioner thats making me cold nothing moves in here not even your birds im cold as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style time in terms of mph no longer interested me i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe i am in a state of grace when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twentyseven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways im the best yep i was the yoni yum femininehygiene dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off i was a successful model once american cheese the king of road food going north i dont know anything about it well okay ill try it i dont see the point in it but ill try it just for you its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city however what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship why yes technically jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think but countess if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings a job for me your ranch bonanza

it alone its not your business the little creep hates it that eric actually does what the company hired him to do i call it the turtle as in carrying your home on your back i bet you havent had lunch great idea pointing a lousy dart gun at some nut with a highpowered hunting rifle be careful therere two of them what are you doing be right back i left my camcorder in the caryes horrible he was tired and pale yes i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial yes no never six years no but i can get it for you rebecca lawson i assume his girlfriend i had some papers to pick up a little after eleven because he called me no to show you this its a letter from that lawyer koehler he wrote it to me the day after i saw him hes the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail im gon na go to jail i know theyre gon na make it look like i did it they got ta put it on someone what do you think ive got a gun maybe im gon na kill you too maybe ill blow your head off right now yes you take what people say and make it ugly you make others believe what you want them to she should have been found guilty she shouldnt have gotten off no why would i want to kill him no i dont know pm three fifteen dristan nasal spray yes yes yes she talked him into it she wanted everything yes yes yes yes yes no ive been to a few yes ive tried it im a practical woman mr dulaney killing andrew wasnt in my best interest as it is im out of a job and im not in his will i was jealous of course i was hurt he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with but i didnt kill him yes yes i slept with him but that was a long time ago that bastard who told you that yes i suppose its possible i dont know im not sure i suppose yes he mentioned it he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him that his heart couldnt take it yes it was on a friday i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday it would be october twentyeighth what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial i was at the house one morning i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr marsh when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial yes cocaine no i wasnt lookin through the keyhole if thats what youre thinking id come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew id find their little toys all over the place andrew was a kind and gentle man but he was thirty years older than her wheres the attraction to sleep with someone like that to have the kind of sex they had i really dont know her that well we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it i dont know its incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be rebecca he did look i know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough and well i worked for mr marsh for six years he was a good man until she came alongthere was an inquiry it was his word against mine they believed him i was fired while i was seeing dr paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs he laughed and basically said he would decide when it was over yes he did he used to call me tell me that i couldnt just walk out on him he said that if i didnt come back hed make my life miserable i realized he wasnt serious he was seeing other women asking other nurses at the hospital out so i ended it we dated for about a month last year im a nurse i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital dr paleys on staff there yesthats correct but andrew never told me he had a heart condition he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious no no i havent done it in years i have dont listen to him cant you see hes trying to turn you against me no hes lying shoot him dont push me frank i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite so sue me things have changed i think you should go home and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again ive been thinking about that ive decided to give it to you after ive collected the inheritance you can take that one if you want but theres another copy thats crazy frank its rebecca i need to see you right away ive got the tape no im a survivor you can think whatever you want frank but i didnt kill andrew and im not going to prison for something i didnt do no youre not i do need you no matter what you think of me i didnt do it i knew you were thinking that i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom youre wrong frank i need you to believe that youre too weak frank when you want something you have to do what ever it takes to get it if something gets in your way you remove it fuck him he tried to shatter mine to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today are you scared tonight we open new doors sugar or honey dont worry about paley he cant touch me no one can ive thought it all out im sure youll be able to handle him something wrong you can see me now you were brilliant today of course i went out on the boat i dont know frank but dont you think thats something we should find out i dont use cocaine anymore if she says she saw me doing it shes lying it isnt true you have to believe me shes mistaken what theres nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank no thats what i know you were thinking you and me making love yes it would be nice its hard to let go of a dream isnt it to let go of what you want that seems so far away from who you are now what happened really did you always want to be a lawyer it wont be that hard i hardly know him he wanted me and he couldnt have me sorry andrew loved this old cabin he always dreamed about moving to tahiti living in a hut and becoming a beachbum i could never imagine myself doing that but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive so wonderful soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets leaving the world and its problems behind i wish hed had a chance to do it no not at the office ive got a better idea yes she did hi frank hello not true shall i tell you what you were thinking you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt tastes can change thats not an answer im the photographer what do you think is it against the law why not i know can we get out of here we started talking in fact we talked until four in the morning we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests after that we were together all the time until he left he used to call me every night after he came back then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him ive never left i was at a cocktail party very trendy andrew was in chicago on business he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling he looked so helpless because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard so did this family down the road i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries it wasnt easy the stone walls were high and id scrape my knees as i climbed over on the other side were wild rose bushes the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down because its beyond intellect its emotion its passion it has to be experienced it cant be imagined i dont know if its something i can explain to you yes i thought the subject was sex something like that have you ever seen animals make love mr dulaney they have such passion such savage emotion they struggle and snarl and claw but neither hurts the other not really i am who i am i cant deny it anymore than you can deny who you are i like sex different i like it wild thats not a crime i loved andrew we made love together we made it differently but we still made love it was our way it was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice if i was some middleaged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me im used to being on the outside looking in the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together andrew hardly needed leading he was a very passionate man he was eager to explore i gave him what he wanted we fulfilled each others needs frank hell file hes an ambitious man ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others and thats exactly what the jury will see when they look at me thats why i need a very good lawyer mr dulaney you must have some feeling some immediate impression a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will and the things that went on in that house such wild sex what kind of picture does that paint do you think i did it are you going to represent me it didnt get there from me no never six thirty and he was very much alive yes i didnt know that andrew was dead until mr sattler called me at home that nightfrank stop it stop it i dont want our lives ruined because of this i love you frank i want this to work but you have to help me you have to come back from where ever it is you are it was a place to start you used to like to touch me to make love to me why didnt you come to me we cant pretend this isnt happening talk to me maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael its bad enough that you are its even worse that you can stand here and lie to me youre sleeping with her arent you this isnt a courtroom dont try to turn this around on me why did you lie to me charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you you were with her werent you where have you been thats what i was hoping youd tell me we have to talk is that alright frank no ones asking you not to work i just think you could make some time for your son why dont you talk to him now frank i know youre busy but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him he wanted to know why you werent talking to him yes she sounds like quite a woman whats she like if he files are you going to take the case how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults i swear the both of you some example you set he could let you have your vacation were supposed to go to the lake no it has to be done by tomorrow if you want me to really this is not relaxing youre on vacation remember youre supposed to be relaxing let me go godammit frank let go dont use language like that at the dinner table not even if theyre a dork you should go by and see how hes feeling michael you shouldnt be happy when someone else isnt feeling well thats too badwheres the radio if you cant make it back ill hold up at the douglas shaft stop worryin you sound like a mother hen i copy and its such a handsome head please frank and i swear ill buy one of your paintings if i dont meet up with them you can

hes not dead dead but how can it change every time how do you do that whats the question mark we vere thinking there might be tricks you know surprises that youd worked into the game were having some problems with arcade theres something wrong with arcade the games alive somehow neither are we somethings wrong with the game mr difford its the game arcade howd you know it was us but you always lie so you didnt come from there that means the city on the left must be the city of truth liar did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right did you play arcade last night everybodys sick huh its fifteen after we always meet here you know that has anyone seen greg he thinks im sublimating i just thought of something if we came back from the game what if arcade did too never been on a snowboard there never is one of them anyway did you see it the screamer we dont have a choice screamer look around our times up check your readout there yeah thats what worries me the clocks already ticking the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level once we get all the keys we can unlock arcades heart and then youve got the schematics check got it yeah well i figure these are unusual circumstances one in case you feel it its different this time i already have a boyfriend nick what and what if something happens to you am i suppose to go in after you alone yes i am yes it does dont you see we have to play by the rules thats what it wants put in a quarter what are you looking for you didnt hear me dantes inferno you got the schematics i cant believe you made it what are you going to do no im not virgin sacrifices i was afraid youd say that and beat it at its own game they made arcade its still a game right it thinks like a game maybe it still has to play by the rules someone had to program it in the first place didnt they slipstream then where do we go the police then anywhere we have to stop it from getting out but then it hits the relay stations like the fractals nick what is it what where do we go we cant change the channel lets go around back this is like a movie or something i mean am i paranoid or what lauries she thought benz was at school if theyre sick great but lets make sure come on nick we have to find out whats happened to them i think theyre gone sure because i didnt know where else to go all of them somethings happened to them call

different somethings happened to him funny im coming over no in person now i have to talk to you listen to me greg never came home i think the game has something to do with it nick hello but he was playing the game i mean you saw him yeah so where is he well its a long story go for it and then keep on driving im okay i know oh godoh god in this world wrong is right which way then well go home

aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct really you could have infected him isnt that right isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct do you need a break youd heard of aids in 1984 85 but you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity when approximately what year did this event take place do men have sex with each other in that theater gay pornographic movies what kind of movies do they show there have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street in general do you take risks in other areas of your life do you take risks you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct thank you were you recently promoted miss burton do you still work at wyant wheeler objection we object your honor it would unfairly influence the jury ill withdraw it mr beckett were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater objection objection fact andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level fact he made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit fact he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit fact andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them fact he was successful in his duplicity the partners at wyant wheeler did not know andrew beckett had aids when they fired himnow that you mention it yeah do i have a case why should i rightyou turn it on you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time you take the microwave how about youre too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long term way you dont love me is that it is there somebody else i hope i dont have to pay for that piece of information but its on the water boats all anyone talks about is the wind is it up is it down i cant live with a man who only talks

get out his slides who is the most competitive woman in the world because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didnt whos married to i hate it im so happy becky finally i feel happy this is

have me made for each other dear annie thanks for your letter it was great were very excited about meeting you in new york on valentines day and seeing if we are mfeo sleepless in seattle becky well its the same woman and he was crazy about her what is this this is from seattle i saw her she looked just like this its a sign ive watched this movie too many times im so stupid from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio ive been a complete jerk he said hello that was nothing compared to this humiliation nothing you know that dream where youre walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you good night thank you i love you is this crazy becky thats not what i mean im going back over there tomorrow and talk to him i am i couldnt do it how did i get here definitely i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows what hello i always wondered about that too i know listen to this i love this part and then you left him he lost weight there and you left him no thats impossible a guy cant you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet good perfect ill be in new york with walter i can squeeze it in i want to meet you i dont know i mean what if i never meet him what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him i should say something in this about magic im going to marry walter i just have to get this out of my system i know that you think i dont know that i know thats a dumb way to begin but its the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio on the other hand maybe im just losing my mind i am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows dear sleepless and son they knew it time distance nothing could separate them because they knew it was right it was real it was not actually he sounded nice thats what she called him on the show because he cant sleep nothings with me what was what theres practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true about what no not remotely i just want to find out about him ill tell you the truth i heard this guy on a callin radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because ive become obsessed with him no no no its more like who is he does he have a sense of humor is he nice no forget nice ive got nice no i know that part she has a pattern of getting involved with losers once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus i need to know about him because hes involved with my sister thats what im going to do im going to go home i quit laurie i quit im going back to baltimore how does a blonde do a high five i want my money i know i know howard hi jonah sam and who is this yes come on jonah how am i going to explain this to walter this is a grotesque violation of this mans personal life but never mind perfect sandbag the father thank you tom i feel so much better just having blown this off i know i know i do not want to move to seattle but what i really dont want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something what do you think its just cold feet isnt it everyone panics before they get married didnt you i dont even know him but im having all these fantasies about a man ive never met who lives in seattle but when you met her did you believe she was the only person for you that in some mystical cosmic way it was fated i mean why did you get married was it all fireworks and trumpets and i think im going crazy tom i really do are you happily married its a sign like clockwork mom we already mom magic what what it wasnt a sign it was a coincidence oh please destinys just something weve invented because we cant stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental it is isnt it you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life its silly really i mean id seen him at the office obviously id seen him hes the associate publisher and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat which of course he was allergic to and i got his lettuce and tomato on white youll love them were going down to dc tonight to be with them christmas morning i know hes wonderful isnt he grannys dress oh mom its probably just the flowers walter and i are engaged its me shhhh hi hello magic sure you doyou dont believe in signs so youll get married in a new dress well fine fine fiddle da dee and hows it working of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department so dont be worried if it takes a while i knew we would be together forever and that everything would be wonderful just the way you feel about walter walter its quite a formal name isnt it one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time in the sack i believe you call it magic it was magic you know i was in atlantic city with my family cliff was a waiter he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier ive probably told you this a million times but i dont care and then he held my hand i was scared all sorts of thing were going through my head but after a while i forgot about them at one point i looked down at our hands and i couldnt tell which fingers were mine and which were his and i knew then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna destiny takes a hand how amazing how did it happen are his folks nice i notice these things are back in fashion oh honey hes a lovely man annie the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them well move them everybody annie has an announcement i love the symphony what are your plans in new york youre going to miss the train what about the letter so he cant write big deal i mean verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble mfeo so i mailed your letter this is a photo of hair you dont know who she was annie its a sign but he saw you right i love that dream you were standing in the middle of the street i love you too no thats the weirdest part about it what okay good goodbye you told a lie and got on a plane did you talk to him youd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it the kid is on youve got me listening to this garbage go on turn it on turn on your radio do you think at the end of the movie when shes in the wheelchair they can still do it men never get this movie plus he fell in love with a temp yes can too he lost all the weight there you want to hear about destiny if my husband hadnt gone on a diet which caused me to leave him i would never have been on that flight to miami and met rick and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says vacantoccupied vacant occupied vacantoccupied on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentines day your destiny can be your doom look at me and rick what right you are youre losing your mind what about walter and this woman is a writer thats what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers it sounds like the name of a mattress store movie thats your problem you dont want to be in love you want to be in love in a movie read it to me youre a basket case oh oh really now were getting down to it and now 2000 women want his number the guy could be a crackhead a psychopath a flasher a junkie a transvestite a chainsaw murderer or someone really sick like rick sleepless in seattle whats with you what was that about up there its not true but it feels true whatever it is you should write something about thiswhy not what was it that made you know what are you going to do sam do you think theres somebody out there you could love as much as your wife maybe even more weve been talking to well lets just call him sleepless in seattle and well be right back after this break with listener response your response to the things weve been discussing the number to call is and i dont want to invade your privacy why not have you had any relationship since good how long ago did your wife die i think its hard for him to talk to you about all this maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better dr marcia fieldstone of network america im not selling anything your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife hello sam this is dr marcia fieldstone on network america i have no doubt that youre a good dad you can tell a lot from a persons voice but something must be missing if jonah feels that youre still under a cloud fair enough im sure he wont be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him well i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly is he home right
