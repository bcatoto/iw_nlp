its all right violet its working all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does thats okay as long as he believes it was johnnie what happened i think were going to find out i had a partner and she fucked me every job like this has moments where things dont go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass its in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart thank you youll be clean and well be rich hell have to run if its real enough hell believe it because deep down hell want to because of what you are going to tell him you have to make it as real as you can the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand you will be covered and that moment is the most important moment in the plan not caesar the same way ill know that you went to scotch trust there is no going back if he does trust me violet he wont an accident and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands and shatter against the hardwood floor waiting in the apartment next door we want him to come down to relax feel in control again fine any bodyguards what time did you say they would be there what did gino drink its getting better and better keep going has caesar ever seen him does johnnie hit on you what happened gino marzzone is coming to your apartment its a big deal isnt it that means caesar will be ready he doesnt want to look like an idiot gino has been there before sweet jesus and johnnie is his son thats johnnie marzzone gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money shit marzzone as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family who is gino why it sounded like

have sex with someone i just met someone i hardly know but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself im just making a point you have no idea what youre asking how much trust two people need to do something like this all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me i didnt say that but since you did lets say that you are it would have been easy to set shelly up you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment all right lets say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying i am but these people are serious violet if you want to know how serious ask shelly theyre worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules you fuck them youve got to do it right wait a minute wait a minute do you have any idea what you are saying you are asking me to help you fuck the mob how much money what choice for what mickey sounds like he wanted to get caught he was in love with you right even

be poor boy has to work so hard gino travels with a big man named roy caesar calls him the driver the plane is in at seven so id say about eight scotch glenlivet i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it gino doesnt know english or at least he pretends he doesnt so he doesnt talk much he gets right to the point both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left he does it right in front of him johnnie hits on anything in high heels not much really caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear yeah twice yeah yeah thats his brother gino marzzone it started way before i was around i think basically its because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father like each other they hate each other johnnie yes its in a case on his desk in his office i saw it this morning to let it dry he hung it up yeah do you think you know me like that is that what you think you think im lying thats why i need your help you said you were good caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through shellys books to figure out how he did it shelly said it was over two million dollars caesar is going to get the money and bring if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register you made a choice once do you think you would make that same choice again i want out i want a new life i see what ive been waiting for but i need you corky hes the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be but mickey doesnt like it like they do i suppose thats why hes good at it caesar lives for these moments he tells me its just the business but i know its more than that he likes it the violence ill catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars he says they remind him who he his theyre all like that except maybe mickey maybe he did he would brag to me all the time he was never afraid of caesar because he didnt know him not like i do for shelly taking the money was a way to take from caesar he could have run at any time but he didnt because he didnt want out thats what he told himself but it wasnt even about me it was about caesar he wanted what caesar had thats how they are i understand them yes shelly was skimming from the business he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him fuck it i think you better leave no shelly knows what i am he saw me in a bar with another woman you mean shelly we make our own choices and we pay our

productive so theyre closing down the school hi gale weathers field correspondent inside story as long as it records i dont give a shit were not doing a remote whats the delay prep the compact well hide it in a window and tape all of tonights festivities not this time i owe cotton that much hell even i thought that man was guilty if im gon na blow this up i need hard proof no not so fast we have nothing concrete jesus christ an innocent man on death row a killer still on the loose kenny tell me im dreaming jesus the camerahurry but couldnt it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat the same person who planted it in cottons car framing him the same person who really killed your mother he was drunk that night he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him not one word he admits to having sex with your mother but thats all many times i think you falsely identified him yes he was convicted in a court of law your testimony put him away it doesnt matter what i

herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression please its common knowledge her mother was a trollop maybe shes a slut just like her mom maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage what if she did it what if sidney killed casey and steve for attention the girl has some serious issues she was never attacked i think she made it all upwhere do you get this shit cut some slack she watched her mom get butchered youre evil why would sidney want to be with steve she has her own bubblebutt boyfriend billy and why

call to call me so i wouldnt think it was you uhhuh no sheriff burke called your dad i saw him when youre arrested youre allowed one phone call who did you call who did you call yeah i think so you heard me or even a good porno i wan na let go i do but this is life this isnt a movie everytime i get close to you i see my mom i know it doesnt make sense i think in some weird analytical psychological bullshit way im scared im gon na turn out just like her you know like the bad seed or something but youre right enough is enough i cant wallow in the grief process forever and i cant keep lying to myself about who my mom was no billy im the one whos been selfish and selfabsorbed with all of my post traumatic stress so its okay we need to talk your parents split up its not the same
