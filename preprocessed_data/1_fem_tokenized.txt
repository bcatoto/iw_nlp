get in there anyway with the cameras and the swipe cards even if all this were true therere 20 other buildings all of them filled with computers and milo why would he like this its gary youre talking about youre scaring me i think we should just go they hack into peoples programs i cant see outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that are you saying you think they had something to do with his death nelson said it was an airtight case it was a hate crime teddy was killed last night i mean if one little comment from gary is gon na upset you this much whats extreme is what that

dont get your hopes too high bully are we talking about gary boyd or your dad its important then youve got ta ask him about that cmon how often do you talk to somebody whos been on the cover of time three of four times i dont think he knows how he said it made sense that garys code was like teddys that that clichï½ about great minds was true said it was all about his own guilt plus he has a tendency to get gary mixedup with his dad once in a while it always passes prick instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl fire her or something hell tell me when he gets home nolatitude 47 degrees what maybe its the satellite but you said the other its three years old it tell me youre not calling on your car phone please dont go why does he know you know youll come up with something you could always say you have to go the bathroom same with the excerpts im choosing theyll play against any of the images you described milo what if shrot notices somebody entered the day care at four am and tells them about it yeah thats old in a tree he doesnt know about the day care milo shrot suspects somebody broke into 21 i was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts the dishes are juiced up too gary whatd he say cause their apartments might be bugged oh i liked you i was checking you out i thought the worst they would do is fire me who knew they took termination so literally and what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 arent hot yet you said the place isnt finished you mean break in before they kill somebody else too its a standard gui once ive got a concept its maybe three days work but theyd still get the idea right a what hes got 12 satellites up hes got dishes on top of 21 hes building this meganetwork for skywire lets use it how close are you time but still you cant say cbs wouldnt love to break something like what about 60 minutes we could crossreference a data base on media ownership but not on our own computers not even at home the mainstream media tv or a newsmagazine therere so many disinformation sites about gary already where he has devils horns or they crop him in with saddam hussein who can we trust what about the fbi i always felt if a boy i liked ever found out hed run hed think i was unclean milo hes out of prison is that my scenario tell me oh yeah but why would they the day care why would you do a thing like thats great i didnt know then and now but not right now long story not that interesting mmmmore like i have a little trouble trusting people maybe once i rewrote it anyway mines not the ceo he barely

graphical interfaces for skywire im sposed to coordinate with you no i know what you mean i used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers least they make sense sometimes you think

clear with you perhaps to the point of being insulting i will never have sex with you ever if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation i still would not have sex with you i hope this is part of the unfreezing process what sure we dont use the term negro anymore its considered offensive a chigro mr powers please i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand i would appreciate it if youd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest im sorry excuse me i beg your pardon i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages i wanted to travel see the world in my last year i was accepted into the mod in the cultural studies sector i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country its very boring my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi if i do well with this case i finally get promoted to field operative listen mr powers i look forward to working with you but do me a favor and stop calling me baby you can

obsessed by weather three agents killed by bad weather thats what we were working on exactly thered been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea propane gas mostly in small quantities it captures chlorine protects the ozone layer but it proved impractical too bulky the prospero project was started by my husband it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming in theory climate engineering is entirely feasible we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite a quick fix not quite this is my field but thanks i see what you mean about letting me do the risking hello she had this in her mouth there there is that written in his shoe any ideas very good steed how on earth can you tell i should have thought that was obvious im in

cost a pretty penny are you trying to rap to me im an asthmatic been one all my life cant go anywhere without an inhaler what do you want to know enough people show their happiness in a lot of different waysold fool roderick you know well enough that i have never loved but you was i ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy ever so angry but the least offer of goodwill on your part did not bring me to your side did i not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of england upon you have i repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it no i loved you too much and too fondly i have always loved you from the first moment i saw you i saw your bad qualities and trembled at your violence but i could not help loving you i married you though i knew i was sealing my own fate in doing so and in spite of reason and duty what sacrifice do you want from me i am ready to make any so you will but love me or if not that at least you will gently us me as soon as i saw you loved me i was pleased and i gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me being certain that for my part i would never love you but after our first kiss i found that i had no power over myself i did not know that one kiss could matter so much without you my dearest i might have died without ever knowing love inexpressible love god of nature bitterness than which nothing is sweeter sweetness than which nothing is more bitter divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes shall i tell you something i believed what was called love came after the union and i was surprised when my husband making me a woman made me know it only by pain unaccompanied by any pleasure i saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead and so we became only friends seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other yet on good terms for a while as whenever he wanted me i was at his service but since the offering was not seasoned with love he found it tasteless and seldom demanded it my husband has convinced me of the contrary our abstinence makes our love immortal if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago now i should love you even more but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires always my dear one never any further love is a child to be pacified with trifles a full diet can only kill it poor man and for that reason you want to begin where people end you will do as you please it seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other do you not agree and if she does not choose to show you some kindness be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are but you deceive me nonetheless if i believe you for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer the amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing if it is true that you love me to make me wretched in two weeks you want my heart how so a man may need to do that and find it amusing but a girl is bound by other laws it is only too possible love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult and it is even more difficult to make it last but if when i love i am unhappy i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune your word empty makes me laugh is it fortunate or unfortunate if it is fortunate i congratulate myself if it is unfortunate i do not care for i am not aware of it many worthy of attention but valuing is something more i could value only someone whom i loved that man has perhaps not yet been born not one not even that never noyou must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in dublin where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound i hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house where captain oreilly will welcome with delight my gallant young preserver thats very kind of you mr ohiggins but i shouldnt like to put you to such trouble mister that fool didnt know what was the meaning of a hundredpound bill which was in the pocketbook that the fellow took from me everything my purse containing upwards of a hundred guineas my jewels my snuffboxes watches and all because this blundering coward fell to his knees oh i am grateful to you sir i am the wife of captain oreilly hastening to join him at dublin my chair was stopped by a highwayman this great oaf of a servantman fell down on his knees armed as he was and though there were thirty people in the next field working when the ruffian attacked not one of them would help but on the contrary wished him good luckhow do you know that we can prove that youre not ray dunbar impersonating a fellow cadet is a courtmartial in and of itself you kept kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end you even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him too wheres the cabin why didnt you tell us all this in the first place mueller was alone in the cabin back up what about the phosphorous grenade where what business he said he worked there epilepsy tell us about the other guys the ones west weeded out are you saying sergeant west tried to kill you he was your friend your phone number yeah a word of advice about women that first hour or so after they kill their boss probably not the best time to hit on them nah go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened what are you doing out here yeah i can wait till youre off the base and do it myself nobody saw but i dont think so far as im concerned whatever you did in the past can stay in the past youre a good man hardy thats not true what if i dont want it this isnt the time what we need to talk no bodies no west hardy for chrissakes hardy what are you doing we got maybe three minutes till they break it down four no we were close to something with kendall for what you know you never told me why you left the army think itll work so what now so did i you wanted to break him you mean the falsely accused you wanted to get the truth you couldnt have known see i just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls then i call every newspaper in the country with the story about how senator kendalls gay son went nuts on a training mission good idea positive hardy they planned this what kendall said the type of guys you dont feel comfortable going to sleep around thats what dunbar said about childs to the letter they got their stories straight little bit so why after dunbar drags kendall out from under a house does the senators son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber buttfucks the cabin so its a good plan but it goes wrong mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy which means they have to bring dunbar and kendall into the cover story they believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent dunbar talk it through childs mueller and nunez know theyre going out on the regular tuesday night drill hurricane or no hurricane so they plan it kill west pin it on pike at least you and kendall agree on that what because its my job because people are dead because of the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that we can do this hardy but you will i was starting to believe you you know that you werent who everyone said i guess i was wrong you did more than try you cracked dunbar in less than three minutes as an investigator youre phenomenal you said you owed styles and now youre gon na turn your back on him goddammit hardy you cant just leave styles couldnt reassign him hes a legend i dont know look all weve got is what kendall says and he didnt actually witness any deaths except nunez he found west he saw mueller and pike but just their bodies he didnt see any crime committed i just he came back for kendall i dont think hes capable of murder i dont think that has anything to do with but we have to question him thought you didnt have cigarettes that was kid gloves remember hes the son of a senator so go easy kid gloves not the happiest of memories something wrong what point imagine what it must have been like for them out there what do you think of dunbar youre off to a late start you do understand that theres absolutely no way i could ever be attracted to you right this is the straight hitting on me you were talking about isnt it youre kidding something like that you typical army brat story dad was noncom mom was a nurse there was never any real doubt of joining up what is that were in the middle of a murder case you really want to make banal chit chat like that now you made me look like an idiot baseball the colonel saw you shoot nunez youre a murderer i questioned him for three hours and he didnt make a sound you dont have a badge he wont talk to you good copbad cop that is the most unprofessional excuse me why yes kendall junior is still in surgery so he wont be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour the cadet were talking to first is dunbar senator jonathan kendall of ohio hurricane knocked out our mainframe so all we have are their dogtags cadets raymond dunbar and levi kendall wording and your friendship with the colonel aside im not comfortable having you involved in this youre the tom hardy ive been reading about in the papers right new orleans pd fired you for taking bribes from guissepe torres you and the colonel go back sergeant wests served for twenty three years hes the public face of the modern army you knew sergeant west hostile and uncooperative what happened with nunez so you framed him the same way childs was going to frame pike who levi wrong answer what enjoy your flight to washington it will and you know why because youre not a person anymore youre a cadet in the united states army you have no identity no miranda warning and no rights so im gon na throw you to the wolves and unlike you im gon na get away with it because youre pissing me off it doesnt matter levi were going to find those bodies and when we do im going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon you and dunbar got your stories straight little details little inconsistencies designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other asking questions killing time until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where senator daddy can protect you you think youre just going to slide out of this youre an accessory to murder levi youre going to jail dunbar says you were pike never confessed fifty minutes pike never confessed but you didnt see it right nunez was chasing dunbar no one else heard it he said what he couldnt kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own we just want so no no that was cadet dunbar yeah you never told me why you got kicked out of what happens to dunbar now we know he tried to burn dunbar to us you dont do that if youre not involved its too neat no search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup if theyre hurt and we can get to them in time hes not army its not official but this guy you called hes not even army this is totally unnecessary lucky girl i know go please go just go its okay just leave it i wont be selling you this house mr bloom i was 18 he was 28 turns out that was a big difference im not convinced you should be happy then i dont think so mr bloom if nothing is going to change id just as soon it not change in the way it hasnt been changing all this time so ive heard no one would come out here unless they had business and no one would have business with me except for you youre buying the town you must be edward bloom promise me youll come back how are you gon na make it without your shoes and when im 38 youll be 48 and thats not much difference at all im eight that means when im eighteen youll be 28 and when im 28 youll only be 38 how old are you its not a woman its a fish no one ever catches her was she nekkid what did she look like well therapy and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back i was living in a fairy tale no its logical if you think like your father see to him theres only two women your mother and everyone else look i dont know how much you want to know about any of this you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it especially this late in the game can i ask you a question why did you come here today if you found this deed why didnt you just ask eddie wow wow you just said it i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour this was on his sales route so he was through here all the time everyone in town knew him i am and youre will ive seen your picture thats how i recognize you i almost said something at the store but it would have been awkward like this i wasnt expecting you oh ohi like your stories you were talking about your wedding is it the medicine thats making you thirsty i thought you said you didnt have a church wedding oh so this is a tall tale i never knew please can i take your picture stop no i understand thats terrible what were you dreaming about hi how are you feeling really i do im sorry it seems every hour i have to i need to lie down for a bit ill help you i spent a week in morocco for the story it was incredible yes your father had a stroke hes upstairs with your mom and dr bennett i am always on your side and i think you should talk to him youre not but its not true do you love him do you love your father mmm what but its romantic what about the details how they fell in love the circus the war you never told me any of that you never told me how your parents met i talked with your father last night im going with you im going with you you need to go its badi see we need to get you one of those plant misters we can spray you like a fern how can i convince you to stop you dont even know me how did you get so many daffodils but youre wrong i do know you at least by reputation edward bloom from ashton see im actually engaged to a boy from ashton don price he was a few years older than you im sorry i loved it it sounds peculiar but i loved every minute of it i did eddie was travelling a lot so he was gone but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me a little part of his soul inside me i could feel it it was alive and kicking do you like it being pregnant i know it was the same when i was carrying will like clockwork im going to check on him im going to get started on dishes well have to pick up a copy down the hall on the right the door sticks you have to really pull it thank you ill bet you need to yes thank you thats okay i dont suppose one of us could stay with him in case he in case he wakes up one of us should be there heavens no we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place i suppose your grandmothers house when she passed on but we sold that right away your cousin shirley bought it yes he just fell asleep josephines with him not everything your father says is a complete fabrication do you know who that is was she one of your teachers before i forget your father has papers in the basement id like you to go through i wouldnt know whats important well clearly you dont but im not the mystery youre trying to solve right now i know its not easy just remember he didnt choose to be your father and you didnt choose to be his son you just ended up together you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and itd be just the same if you ask me its a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all yes you both think william bloom is a very smart man the problem is you only see me as your mother and not as someones wife and ive been his wife longer than ive been your mother you cant discount that no its not its exactly the same your father and i met we dated and we married we chose each other because we understood each other on some fundamental level just the same as you two would you say you understand josephine yes will i do and dont presume things you dont know yes of course really thats wonderful you dont talk about those things not yet hes impossible he wont eat and because he wont eat he gets weaker and because hes weaker he

still we should write it down ill get the book where were you jason in the carits not in the file i swear i know your file your first job was geneva i swear to god you never worked here no jason please you never worked berlin your first assignment was geneva no you never worked berlin what do you mean he closed down treadstone he took care of me after paris please im only here because of paris because they cant figure out what youre doing im here because of abbott conklin stuff on conklin you left a print there was kel that didnt go off there was a partial print they tracked it back to treadstone they know its you and you got to him before we could it was pamela landys op the guy was going to sellout a mole or something i havent been debriefed on exactly what it was last week an agency field officer went to make a buy from a russian national what is this a game they know they know you were here they know you killed these two guys they know you and conklin had something on the side they dont know what it is but they know you hear me i believed you i did jason i swear i did i told them i told them i believed you yes so i dont know he was sick he wanted out i believed him its got caffeine in it thats all i know because hes doing just what he said hed do hes coming for us i dont think we need to keep looking for him anyway what do you want from me i was reassigned im out these were killers conklin had them all jacked up they were dobermans you mean did i want a date youre making it out like were friends here or something i met him alone twice if you say so i believed jason bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown look what do you want me to say i was there i believed him am i a doctor no but good luck before this before bourne no depression anger compulsive behaviors they had physical symptoms headaches sensitivity to light no you lost your way no good options left and danny zorn what was that and pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it why would be enough for me id rather stand if its all the same to you im sorry ward dont know did he say anything to you they found danny zorns body dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time sorry to wake you well whatever hes doing ive had enough this is now a search and destroy mission i want the berlin police fully briefed and get this out to all the agencies so whats he doing you believe him dont you want answers hold on he said he wants to come in and you do from the moment he left treadstone he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him ive already got a team there i doubt bournes in naples to settle down and raise a family whats definitive is that i just lost two people in berlin may i finish excuse me at the time of his death conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of sevenhundred and sixty thousand dollars this is conklins computer ivan mevedev senior financial manager worked for one of the new russian petroleum companies pecos oil he claimed to know where the money landed we believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the agency this i think i do we had a deal going down in berlin last week during the buy both our field agent and the seller were killed we pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didnt go off they were killed by jason bourne and bourne wheres he now so you had conklin killed i mean if were cutting the crap i want to know what happened lets talk about conklin he does ive been down to the archives i have the files ward i want to know about treadstone thats not gon na fly treadstone why youre alive youre alive because youre special because she kept you alive because we want you back on our side sounds like a threat do you think you can read are you well enough thank you for your gift im sorry about marie are you disappointed careful ramstein air base germany before the wall fell you would have woken up in a russian prison hospital okay jason your move who okay how do you want to do it what do you want bourne what the tapes well know for sure when we get the security tapes this stays between you and i we finally have an edge i dont want to lose it alright take it down i want to look at the room check it out the hotel how far uplink all relevant files to kim and i want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with treadstone then get a number they need to know who theyre dealing with whos going us and the germans cant match it we need to get in there i think that bourne and conklin were in business that bourne is still involved and that whatever information i was going to buy in berlin it was big enough to make bourne come out from wherever hes been hiding to kill again hows that scan for a thief a mole i vetted the source marty hes real if it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects its a bargain at ten times the price were talking raw unprocessed kgb files its not something we can go out and comparison shop thats where we came out felt promising its a start lets give him half an hour alright what do you think is he coming in is it fresh and why is that see thats a problem for me nicky whatever hes doing we need to end it this isnt the kind of mess you walk away from some women like dobermans did you you felt nothing no spark two young people in paris dangerous missions life and death not good enough youre the person who floated this amnesia story ever feel sorry for him for what hed been through so he fooled you believed what are you an expert in amnesia im curious about bourne your interpretation of his condition you have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions you were his local contact you were with him the night conklin died youre coming with us amnesia what kind of problems and what about you anything are we hacking or asking alright i want you kurt and kim to stay on bourne track everything thats out there by who yeah thatll workwhat the hell was he doing here are we locked up anything what the hell is a treadstone do we know what this saystonight my parents are growing suspicious i cant keep meeting you every night shush its only been a day and its seemed like forever this night is too beautiful to have again you scare me nor i i accept your proposal did it work youve been here before you are and ill come again thank you for inviting its not you he dislikes that youre a wallace he just says the wallaces dont seem to live for very long wake up william wake up and i with you but you must wake yes you are and you must wakenor you to you that word is as unfamiliar as love i respect him at worst he was a worthy enemy show mercy oh thou great king and win the respect of your own people i have come to beg for the life of william wallace when will his trial be is it true wallace is captured grant as you do everything else with treachery offer him a truce to discuss terms and send me to my castle at locharmbie as your emissary he trusts me pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along and i will set the meeting and the ambush wallace himself if you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every scottish town i leave you to your hauntings if you wish to take him i know a way i am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries all of england shudders with the news of renewed rebellion good day to you mlords yes i had thought that i was loathsome to you perhaps i am if i may be excused mlord no mlord his majesty was quite keen that you should understand scotland he intends you directed me to report to you the moment the kings conference was ended he will fight you forever but what does he fight for freedom first and peace so grant them i have faced him have you forgive me sire i thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule no i have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war humbly mlord a mindless barbarian not a king like you mlord he waits for you he says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come fight him no he did not shall i leave mlord your pardon mlord he asked me to come in his stead i wouldnt know this scottish rebel wallace he fights to avenge a woman he shouldnt be telling secrets in bed how do you know this i cant bear the thought of your torture take it drink this it will dull your pain you will die it will be awful mercy is to die quickly perhaps even live in the tower in time who knows what can happen if you can only live sir i come to beg you to confess all and swear allegiance to the king that he might show you mercy no but can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost or simply love me because i love you you understand consider before you laugh and say no you will never own a throne though you deserve one but just as the sun will rise tomorrow some man will rule england and what if his veins ran not with the blood of longshanks but with that of a true king i have taken vows more than one ive vowed faithfulness to my husband and sworn to give him a son and i can not keep both promises because of the way youre looking at me now the same way as when we met it does me good to see you i understand you have suffered i know about your woman peace is made is such ways let us talk plainly you invade england but you can not complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply the king proposes that you withdraw your attack in return he grants you title estates and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold which i am to pay to you personally that is not possible did god make you the sacker of peaceful cities the executioner of the kings nephew my husbands own cousin i understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight but now that i am here will you speak with a woman i come as the kings servant and with his authority i am the princess of waleswhat thank you for showing it to me first ill ill take care of it can i have the picture what is it im sorry but can it wait til tonight im already late for work no dances just tell me so what did you find evan wake up oh please wake up how soon well he has been pushing me to meet his father but ive been putting it off come on i doubt the answers that simple but hes seven what kind of stress can he have but you must have something to go on and the bad news why what for anything just tell me that evan doesnt have jasons illness not according to his teacher it just got me thinking about jason and what if evans inherited his fathers condition just like jason how did you know that youre acting like your father fix what does that mean for evan cute evan fine youll get them evan but i think its far more important to focus on your case right now i found these the others are still in storage i dont know these things take time i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal hes sure he can get you off on selfdefense so if youre patient and then just before it got so bad that he had to be committed he said that he could i couldnt tell if they were real memories or just phantoms you know he might only have thought he actually remembered them when he was around your age almost exactly your age he said he figured out a trick to remember the past why do you ask please he got straight as without ever touching a book that was the one area where his memory never failed him i cant help it im just so proud of you youve got the highest grades in all of your classes dont try to use your blackouts to get out of this one something mustve happened what set him off now your father may seem sleepy to you but thats just because of his medicine okay honey what were you doing with that great ill see you soon thats why i wanted you to come here evan dr redfield already has a background in memory loss youll be fine dr redfield just wants to give you some tests youll like him good because ive been waiting to see your art projects all week and id feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there i get the point kiddo but im not so bad am i weve been over this a hundred times its too dangerous for him you know the answer to that darn it thanks dont worry evan youll have plenty of time when did you ever care about getting to school on timewhy not but thats not how things wound up im with lenny lennys your friend and there it ends well a lot of things cross my mind ive always been a fast thinker ev i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second boom we fall in love get married two kids your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature kids grow old as do we relatively stable relationships matching burial plots the whole bit it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine its crossed my mind from time to time

parentteacher bridgethen go find her donnie dont let her get away she was right about the rabbits go so will donnie find his cellar door sometimes its the only thing that keeps us going a famous

vulnerable oh thats all right then its the thought that counts thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death aaagh rape ah and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on well you started it but thats a circular argument if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out why why have you got to go round killing and looting what about the killing and looting thats just as crude isnt it you dont like it do you about raping me what dyou expect you come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me what oh get it over with what rape you dont love me its obvious you havent raped anyone in

the fuck he is heheh my significant other heh heh and i guess on a certain level i want to break it off but i feel yknow its like this constant questioning and re questioning do i end it should i give it more time im not happy but what do i expect relationships require work you know the drill the thing that i keep coming back to is im not getting any younger i want to have a baby at some point maybe right so then i think i should settle which is not necessarily the best word i mean hes a good guy its not really settling then i think maybe im just a victim of movies yknow that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be but then i think no this is what i really want so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it you know agreed but then i think he is a good guy and its complicated yknow what no i dont like the term boyfriend its so gay well ive been having a bad time of it with um my boyfriend i guess okay i guess i just wanted to say that come by my house yay meet me after work by the old mill youre still excited by my irreverence you havent yet started to think of it as my gratuitous need to shock we should have sex its old hat

if you hide me wow um well cant you just force yourself awake oh such a beautiful view its my favorite book since i was a kid its about these toys theres this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real i cant believe im crying already he says it takes a long time thats why it doesnt often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges or who have to be carefully kept generally by the time you are real most of your hair has been loved off and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby but these things dont matter at all because once you are real you cant be ugly except to people who dont understand do you know the velveteen rabbit joely more joel youre a liar i want to know you you dont tell me things joel im an open book i tell you everything every damn embarrassing thing you dont trust me youre a whiz kid so perceptive so would you get me another joely its you its you who cant commit to anything you have no idea

phone lines and all when youll call me right i would like you to call me would you do that i would like that okay you should stay ill pack a picnic a night picnic night picnics are different and yeah oh great i dont believe in that soulmate crap anymore but he says so many great things we like the same writers this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to and hes cute its fucked up joel you should come up to the charles with me sometime exactly i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me but i was really disappointment to be there with him yknow and thats where psychic stuff comes in like it just isnt right with him yknow that made me cry but anyway we went up to boston because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river it gets frozen this time of year well for the last week anyway hes kind of a kid kind of a goofball but hes really stuck on me which is flattering who wouldnt like that and hes like a dope but he says these smart and moving things sometimes out of nowhere that just break my heart hes the one who gave me that crow photograph i dont either i used to but im through with that yknow if i dont love my body then im just lost you know with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart thats coming round the bend so ive been seeing this guy im nervous you dont need to be nervous around me though i like you do you think im repulsively fat youre very nice god i have to stop saying that youre nervous around me huh like i wanted to talk to you i didnt need any more reason to do it who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist whats the goal joel my goal joel is to just let it flow through me do you know what i mean its like theres all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think were all taught we should be consistent yknow you love someone thats it forever you choose to do something with your life thats it thats what you do its a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through and my feeling is thats how you die because you stop listening to what is true and what is true is constantly changing you know and anyway you sell yourself short i can tell theres a lot of stuff going on in your brain i can tell my goal can i tell you my goal i like you thats the thing about my psychic thing i think thats my greatest psychic power that i get a sense about people my problem is i never trust it but i get it and with you i get that youre a really good guy youre really nice im sorry i yelled at you before about it god im an idiot oh does that make you sad or anxious im always anxious thinking im not living my life to the fullest yknow taking advantage of every possibility just making sure that im not wasting one second of the little time i have its helpful to think theres some order to things youre kind of closed mouthed arent you but i think i am i like to think i am exactly exactly thats exactly my feeling about it its hard to know like okay but how many times do i think something and it doesnt happen thats what youre saying right you forget about those times right me neither but sometimes i have premonitions so i dont know maybe thats just coincidence right yknow you think something and then it happens or you think a word and then someone says it yknow well i go to a psychic and shes always telling me im psychic she should know do you believe in that stuff yknow im sort of psychic drink up young man itll make the whole seduction part less repugnant i know a man who needs a refill no stay just for a little while refill i dont know i cant see them from here joel just pick something good you pick it ready for another yeah well have a seat anyway god that feels so fucking good take yours off i miss grade school i dont know why im calling it grade school all of a sudden when i went we called it elementary school but i like grade school better sounds like something someone from the forties would call it id like to be from then everyone wore hats anyway cheers yeah im not like a robert frost lover by any stretch his stuff seems strictly grade school to me but this made me cry for some reason maybe because it is grade school yknow me neither oh theres an inscription on the

people read it because its the truth and only i know it would you just try him you never know as long as im here you never know hi i was in the neighborhood and thought id see every time i tell you that i love you you flinch but thats your problem drugged is a stupid word hell no the cranes are wonderful okay but im not in this for whooping cranes im in it for cowgirls if we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue then cowgirls become just another compromise i want a finer fate than that for me and for every other cowgirl better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised looks like every time we get together things are in a mess from men the whooping crane has received neither love nor respect men have drained the cranes marshes stolen its eggs invaded its privacy polluted its food fouled its air blown it apart with buckshot i wouldnt say that i expect shes right ultimately but im with delores when it comes to fighting for whats mine i cant understand why delores is so uptight about the chink he could probably teach her a thing or two ee that grass tickles doesnt it god knows i love women but nothing can take the place of a man that fits still this is cowgirl territory and ill stand with delores and fight any bastards who might deny it i guess ive always been a scrapper look this scar only twelve years old and i was felled by a silver bullet debbie says that if women are to take charge again they must do it in the feminine way they mustnt resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods she says it is up to women to show themselves better than men to love men set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the new age shes a real dreamer that debbiedear delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week but so far her third vision hasnt happened niwetï½kame the mother goddess has not gotten back in touch with her meanwhile she and debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools tension cowgirl tension what a drag learned from the chink oh my ha ha thats hard to say we mostly uh a lot of his talk is pretty goofy did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth its not original its something i picked up from the chink no maam no way theres girls on the rubber rose who are political but i dont share their views i got no cowgirl ideology to expound politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it cowgirls exist as an image a fairly common image the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture therefore it seems to me the existence of cowgirls should prevail otherwise theyre being fooled in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls two and both of em are trickriders trickriding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks thats what prostitutes call it you know tricking about well that doesnt matter that part never interested me anyway the beatnicks were before my time and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope clichï½s and the clap but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl oh i know about sissy hankshaw all right ive done a little hitchhiking myself ah shucks thats like telling annie oakley youre a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone id heard tales about you from people id meet in jail cells and truckstops i heard about your uh your ah your wonderful thumbs and i heard how you were jack kerouacs girl friend welcome podner by god its great to have you here its an honor sorry i took so long getting to you but weve had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to dohow am i going to be the progenitor of a tribe when im living on an isolated ridgetop with delores well if the clock people give you any inside information on the end of the world drop us a postcard but thats an old story now i cant believe that you would leave the butte she had a one wayticket to kansas city the countess has come to our aid the rubber rose ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls and i have been asked to oversee the ranch for 300 a week and as it turns out the countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was heres a picture is everything getting worse what do you believe in then then if you are japanese then why are you called the chink the clock people siwash huh clockworks what was that but i dont know how to polka oh well theres been some trouble on the ranch i came up here to get out of the way its so dark now i doubt if i could find my way back down if you could help im a friend of bonanza jellybeans where are the others you might say that although i dont think of it as traveling well no i dont reside anywhere in particular i just keep moving i dont im staying with the countess if i flinch when you say you love me its both our problems my confusion becomes your confusion students confuse teachers patients confuse psychiatrists lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts but the peyote is obviously affecting their brains its made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years no i guess not how did this business get started anyhow why are the birds nesting here so be it it looks serious this time though all these guns are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes thats jellybean you dont agree with debbie then what is debbies position really the chink huh ive gathered that you sometimes speak with him what else have you learned from the chink youre political then about being a cowgirl whats it all about when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl tell me about it no im afraid that part isnt true jack was in awe of me and tracked me down we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field but he was hardly my lover besides i always travel alone er you seem to know who i am and maybe even what i am thanks for the breakfast my thumbs hurt ive made a mistake ive been negligent i havent exercised i have to hitchhike a little bit every day no matter what its like a musician practicing his scales when i dont practice my timing gets off my thumbs get stiff and sore i have to go julian getting dressed ive got to go its not the air conditioner thats making me cold nothing moves in here not even your birds im cold as i developed however i grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style time in terms of mph no longer interested me i began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time slow ancient vast when i am really moving stopping car after car after car moving so freely so clearly so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass then i embody the rhythms of the universe i am in a state of grace when i was younger i hitchhiked one hundred and twentyseven hours without stopping without food or sleep crossed the continent twice in six days cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways im the best yep i was the yoni yum femininehygiene dew girl from 1965 to 1970 but got laid off i was a successful model once american cheese the king of road food going north i dont know anything about it well okay ill try it i dont see the point in it but ill try it just for you its kind of silly actually me going out with an artist in new york city however what makes you think this watercolorist and i would develop a romantic relationship why yes technically jack kerouac and i came awfully close but he was afraid of me i think but countess if you dont want me to pose for him why do you want me to meet him the food and drug administration said wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters burns and rashes although the fda judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings a job for me your ranch bonanza jellybean does that mean you might have an assignment for me ive always been proud of the way nature singled me out its the people who have been deformed by society i feel sorry for ive been steady moving for eleven years and some months maybe i should rest up for a spell im not as young as i used to be a born freak can only go uphill tiredhis peritoneum has ruptured 90 over 50 and falling ive got a pulse hes alive you didnt hear it you must have heard it whats happening nothing its nothing starck the dark inside i dont understand what does what justin what shows you ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there justin i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin yeah im im okay skipper crystallized frozen i found one everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact okay im on the bridge theres no one here skipper i can see the hatch i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing that means they didnt abandon ship jesus its huge weve got pressure no no its alright i talked to my ex hell keep denny over christmas and ill get him this summer goddam it skipper i havent seen him in two months just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months ive seen bodies before this is different about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were i did theres no one here blood looks like arterial spray dr weir whats this the door to heres another one theyre all over the place dj its okay youre okay just breathe they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan the shuttles ohtwo tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen there was a spark and both ships were incinerated the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat captain miller was able he served on the goliath dont worry about it hes hard but hes fair youre lucky to be shipping out with him hes one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach first time in a grav couch i dont care you got any coffee we have to do something oh god come on babybear open this door do you know what it was yes yes justin we heard it can you shut it down theres no one in the corridor but usrun hurry i dont know the process dr weir was the expert there must be a way what about engineering youre okay now its over i dont know the screens are dead it is not weir miller hes back he was in the tank ill do it blow it up weve got to shut it down weve got to weir cant be alive five seconds you better hurry hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit justins in the airlock miller come in nine hours and twentytwo minutes i thought you wanted an answer and thats the only one i have i know that its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports i didnt say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us youve got to listen there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged what if there were a connection between the two the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system ive got a theory i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin miller who maybe one of the original crew i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins whats the point ill just get the same thing i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels i thought of that with the filters from the clark weve got enough breathable air for twenty hours after that wed better be on our way home its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot oxygen is not the problem the antennae arrays completely fried weve got no radio no laser no highgain no ones going to be coming to help us it tastes bad were all here thats an affirmative theres not enough radiation to throw off the scan im picking up trace life forms but i cant get a lock on the location somethings wrong with the bioscan crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees i just finished drying ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready its cold skipper justin just activated the door its on a thirty second delay almost got it keep him talking hes engaged the override not according to the computer what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever im trying goddammit miller do you read me peters decompression wouldnt do that what happened to his eyes picking up magnetic interference the scope is lit its right in front of us if they are theyre screening their calls this is us aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel all boards are green everythings five by five smiths right neptune theres nothing out there if something happens well be on our own justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock what is it in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset what are you doing maybe a power interruption crashed the system im sorry it must be hard being so far away from her claire is your wife why dr weir i think youre in love i cant believe we built this i dont know the life readings just went off the scale what is it if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship it doesnt make any sense affirmative the hulls intact but theres no gravity and the thermal units are off line im showing deep cold the crew couldnt survive unless they were in stasis the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious a straight line howwhere is reed no its not i thought i was done waiting for reed were all in this together now ben just give reed a little more time you know how he works analyzing

will follow up with details jumping off now security what the hell you talkin about your base isnt secure jordan dear how are they treating you awright hows our girl doin anyway well seeins how this thing is out you let me handle the rpm from this point forward i want all press matters coordinated via my office ill be goddamned if im gon na watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one him or the president this my shade midnight mahogany cuz im comin dangerously close to lookin like ronald reagan here are you truly mouthin off to a senior member of the senate arms committee i mean ill give you points for style just nothin for smarts and now i got reporters from toadsquat iowa calling my office and askin what i know about this gi jane thing commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill these were supposed to have been discreet test cases she made it through sere training got a call this morning from yes think i overplayed it ill act surprised that aside for the moment im struck by the tenor the illspirit of your report the degrading remarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior in my seven years on this committee ive never seen a downed aviator treated like this never im deeply disturbed by this report mr hayes not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well id like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything mr hayes yes i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone elses and your conclusion was pilot error hmm the navys conclusion regarding the crash of an f14 aboard an aircraft carrier female aviator it just so happens youre familiar with this report and its conclusion am i right the lark report well im just an old dame without much time left so youll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my bloodtype i am deeply concerned over the navys seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military case in point whoa whoa whoa landbased maritime specialties gim me a second here to deeuphemize that well i spoke with mr hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off no more test cases he was only too happy to oblige dont play politics with me little darlin youd be up way past your bedtime youll think about my offer ive had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began and thats quite verifiable i once promised you a fast ticket jordan and i always meant to make good on that come work for me i can always use a hardcharger on my team the reality is this we send far too many men off to war i dont need to compound the problem with women can you honestly tell me you wanted that life squatpissing in some thirdworld jungle with jordan i dont expect you to fully understand this but sometimes theres more to be gained from the fight than the victory im saying its not going to happen not when the president is set to turn this into a thirdrail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags in face i do roper harris gallop they all come back the same what he did was light the bandwagon on fire because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harms way should probably ask him that wickwire was there to help to be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot at least that was the intent absolutely not jordan might we do this over lunch tomorrow i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely sounds familiar jordan i always hoped wed get together though just now im gearing up for a childcare vote that gon na be visiting that allwomans americas cup team in a few weeks if i were a gambler id say dennis oconners days are numbered but theyre in san diego so i thought id take a quick promenade of the base hmmm maybe ill ask when i see you in person therell be more to follow but yes dear right now youre the pick of a very large litter and your success would mean a lot jumping now yes dear my office will fill him in and help expedite look forward to meeting you at the proper time jumping off now this is just a test case oneil but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navys official policy on women in combat or actually its official nonpolicy now whos your immediate superior there california highschool pentathlete rotc scholarship graduated with honors top marks in basic training and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of virginia oh the things ill do for one extra vote so everyone i talk to says youre top drawer with silk stockings insidewhatd you find kathy who signed as his sponsoring officer wickwire thomas dane see what you can find or rank but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order dont say my name but are there i mean how many the woman i saw you with i dont know if theres any single reason but my father was navy and he had this oldtime recruiting poster in his den it showed a girl trying on a sailors uniform while saying gee i wish i were a man id join the navy was maybe 10 years old when i first saw it and even then it felt wrong made me mad and i dont think a month has gone by that i havent thought about that poster gee i wish i were a man whos we thats what i hear thank you ensign sir what did he say would you have the discretion to end it right then and there sir if tomorrow i was not under your command would the inquiry still go forward sir please if theres any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud im saying were just friends sir if someone is suggesting that im a lesbian theyre wrong permission to leave sir sir i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this not this article not see me sir so ill get a fair shot wouldnt dream of it sir across the board sir same rules for everyone sir the shape doesnt bother me its just that goddamn rotten stench no sir i think youve resented me from the start sir pardon i cant afford civility sir how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when youve got me set up as an outsider even if i make it under these rules i still lose because therell always be a flag in my file yeah she made it but i mean really why didnt you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base its this doublestandard the separate quarters the deferential treatment its how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met its you sir and it started the day i came here pardon the hour sir but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way sir i just want you to know im not here to make a statement i dont want to make men look foolish all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else i suspect none at this time sir really i have no problem with barber was my next stop sir wouldve had it regulation sooner only thank you sir but i expect a certain amount of pain im fine sir thank you sir west newberry get a photo south fine by me sir ah cmon sir you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it if i spoke with him im sure it is you promise wickwire a fast ticket too i wanted the choice the chance to prove myself my skills my work me thats how it shouldve been so the rhetoric gets you headlines but the reality gets you in trouble you were never going to let women serve in combat you always had a safety net or thought you did what are you saying that a womens life is more valuable than a mans that a womens death hurts a family more you dont know that so isnt the president jumping on your bandwagon if i have to ask again senator ill be asking in front of cameras what changed did you set me up did you set me up just to see me fail it should you nominated him for specrecon just three days after you nominated me you know him lieutenant thomas wickwire uh maam cant complain maam would i be the only one the only woman uh question maam captain dwyer technically i know that sir maam its just that beggin your pardon senator but do you understand that this involves combat training coronado thank you maam um may i ask what this is regarding spotted you chief pri one is to slip you some air so were coming down with a tank just something until the ateam shows over flea cool cortez newman take your minis hit the water go go fuck basherbasher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction stand by for a prc fix hey you okay flea do that well flea i appreciate the respect you just showed me but i dont need it and dont want it not that kind of respect anyway its just gon na hurt us both okay so it really has nothing to do with actual brain size montgomery why do they call you flea sir come on

him unbelievable youre kidding when for this is great theyre going to start eating each other out therei dont want to see your hospital not today leave me now sir i am tired well we must keep in mind the dower laws one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them dont condescend to me we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind some things must never change oh indeed you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes they beg you to consider the future what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army theres a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests well i wouldnt want to trouble you with this now its an antichristian dogma i can not believe you are so calm about it did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church and have you heard anything from our dear friend sally what with all the rumors getting back to england i thought she might inquire after us but then i believe she always looked down on us thats when sally fairfax was tutoring you when you lived with the fairfaxes youre no fool george you never have been and what prize do you see what could we possible gain have you been reading what minister jefferson has to say if he had his way all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome and that would destroy us as surely as a british victory i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed well a very real expectation is the british will hang you theyll burn mount vernon and theyll hang you our marriage is a business just as surely as my god what but to go to war over trade over money surely theres still time for a compromise war no i did not when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable theres no middle ground at all were the kings children my god these people mean to go to war they really mean itmankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains well i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which i now see means us all you remember george when we were studying the great philosophers now that is a lie see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet when you break off your engagement to martha curtis ill divorce william do you hear you get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love is it william says now you have requested a british commission why not colonial ill clear it up for you sir because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that it will even get you into polite society your dream come true george the only dream that really matters to you and what is this then been off to fight the french because you are a patriot or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war george you know i only love you but is that the truth well we cant carry on like animals any longer well the widow curtis will bring you riches position land even halfgrown children you wont have to do anything at all you shant have to do another thing to prove yourself think what the play means william perhaps these words have a place in the real world except for that quite like home england that is oh but you must not mind my talking about you in fact william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you so you are williams wild young neighbor or should i say brother william claims you as a member of his family i have heard so many unflattering tales about you and i understand that except for you this family is quite cultivated voltaire of course remember george it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong and dost thou live to ask it ive been surprised in an unguarded hour but must not now go back the love that lay half smothered in my breast has broke through all its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre i can not if i would conceal it from thee those people i doubt theyd think of this ooo youre wonderful this color why juba was an african and you want to look the part hold still lets get you darker i dont laugh at you george i like you i like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and thats because youre completely incompetent at hiding your feelings and to think i am teaching you to become one of them is it well im scared of what weve become in our freedom do you when i saw those men yesterday in the field and the women and children in those hovels im not so sure if america is as far from england as id hoped the place to want to be is america every english child dreams of it i dreamt it perhaps you best ask why you wish it you asked william to teach you manners philosophy decorum as i said its completely stupid its stupid of course thats just my interpretation actually its a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners you see walk in a gently z there are four distinct movements in the minuet george every movement is significant like the strut of cranes the word minuet finds its source in minitus which is latin meaning small or orderly capture them well ive never seen anything like it so of course im curious africa thats so far how do they get here where do those men come from georgewhat took you so long go get your stuff you dont act like it were you scared up there oh shit im sorry i thought that was im so sorry guys got a fucking pink toilet for christs sake youre as bad as harry are you going down hes doing the same thing you did to him playing letterman on tv harry whatre you doing youre supposed to be in the hospital because a movie star can never order straight from the menu they have to think of something they have to have that isnt on the menu continental but it doesnt matter martin wont order from the menu harry my god hey chili look at me whichever lets talk about it tomorrow no i dont mean that i just meant in general i think you could be an actor i know youre

zip code and a lot dont even know their own phone number that was martin he wants to have lunch tomorrow that is if you can make it a locker at the airport jesus christ harry tell me youre not really that stupid well actually martin the movie we came to talk about is mr lovejoy you were supposed to wait for me with harry at the restaurant and you think the movie business is any different yesterday

make a deal with him then youve read it i think its not horrible i already read it harry left a copy at the house i just caught the end right see how your story ends dont go out of your way yeah well martin is known for his flipping he flips over a script and when the time comes to make a deal he flips out harrys dreaming of a fortymillion dollar production hell never get off the ground with a star hell never sign with or without my help he must mean after slime creature 3 i married martin that was a full time job yeah you know when bette comes up to the guy on the porch gives him a flirty look and says id kiss you but yeah its a real gift im just saying itd be nice one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line you know like in that bette davis picture cabin in the i know im better than what ive been doing the last ten years walking around in a tank top and fuckme pumps waiting till its time to scream yeah that was a good scene i mean for a horror movie you saw that one thats what we finally decided i spent all day crawling out of a grave the costumer kept bitching cause i was ripping my nylons ï½ yeah well make sure you lock it on the way out lem me get

a dog when i came upstairs you stayed to finish your drink i told you to turn off the tv when you were through come to think of it i also told you you could sleep in the maids room be quiet and listen and after all you have such morals thanks but you are interested lufkin his agent oh for christs sake ï½ it didnt slip away martin you did when you went off to fuck nicki in the middle of my birthday party really hello martinget up dodge dodge why not did you try wednesday other than the obvious theres nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside i dont know what else youd call it hes breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out hes totally unresponsive to pain what happened up there im no doctor but id say hes in a coma oh yeah seen a lota movies maybe he isnt alone so we kill him maybe that is his boat im telling you i saw somebody i dont know who it was but i saw somebody i like my job guess ill just keep working what other choices have we got thiss gon na hurt a little or uninvited guests if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot ever heard of insurance big boy bring it on dude supposing one of those cables breaks under tow out here what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now no roger maureen maureen what one more amidships starboard at the beam just under the waterline i dont think its a problem i cant believe you dodges dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share nothing lets get outa here yeah fine i just thought i heard something is all better than starving to death sudden flashes of light headache nausea lights any dizziness because of the gold youre a pal maybe six feet lanky i didnt get a good look he was far away but i saw him i saw him as sure as youre standing there thats a good thing thats what i call a payday probably didnt have time you mean before she sank looks like one hell of a stick up his ass could be a fishing boat showed him a hell of a lot more than that morning everybody maybe twenty gallons an hour i dont give a damn about the gold its a trap there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold nobody ever does its just the bait this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out its the ship the ships making you think this way murphy dont you see whats happening and now youre gon na kill me is that it so you killed them you killed them greers gone he broke out of the tank what what happened if the weather holds it might not be so bad they went crazy maybe it was more than that could be a stroke who knows the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves like wild dogs what do we do with him right here nope epps over just lucky i guess i dont know she said the ship was evil that we had to leave right away that if we didnt we might never leave more than just a mutiny more than just the gold something bad happened here murphy no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims what happened maybe hallucination is the wrong word it was more than that as though they were showing me i dont know what else youd call her one second she was there the next she was gone no someone else a girl im not sure she was real when you found me yesterday at the pool id seen something someone are we smart enough to avoid that the what what do you think happened on this boat couldnt sleep hey its not gon na hold us its a good bet theyll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too maybe the other ship took the worst of it the pages missing then their sos was real their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision distress calls have been made the same day she supposedly went down the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill but who what only something mustve gone wrong youre saying they mutinied for the gold theyre dead in the water that morning four hours later the captains relieved of his command and that evening they issue a general sos same any luck he needs a doctor greer yeah just a bird just a stupid bird epps yup no cowboy shit right guess thatd be me again so we find this guy and make a deal with him it wasnt you it was somebody else theres somebody else aboard of course im sure i saw him i saw him just a minute ago some guy theres somebody else on this boat the guy he just came this way did you see him why not call for help maybe they didnt want it back maybe the whole fat deal was insured youre more practical than superstitious you think shes sailing without a crew so what did happen nope well suppose she got a little further north than she should have got stuck in the ice the passengers and crew evacuated she froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid they write it off fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens the ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her she was sailing up north right whatd you find up there coffee they mustve scuttled it nobody just lets a ship float away go on its my pen namejust do it whats wrong with you tell him im not here what do you mean on his way up iim not sure yeah maybe i was in a horrible mood tell her not to worry ill be completely out of her life in a few days are you going to yell at me

have to take classes and stuff wow hmm im not really sure working i guess uhoh im not sure i mean i guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why its so shocking its complicated i guess im trying to show how racism used to more out in the open and now its hidden or something well no its more like a found art object well i got the idea when i was doing some research and i discovered that cooks chicken used to be called coons chicken and so i decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture i dunno i just like don knotts its supposed to be don knotts enid its sort of like a diary i guess jesus but i feel weird its so sleazy what im just kidding around

are you sure she wasnt there maybe she was just hiding from you what the fuck is she doing she was supposed to be here three hours ago shes not at homeim sorry enid you have to be an official high school graduate before i can nominate you i had to give it to someone else but im sure next year i can well theyre forcing me to give you a nonpassing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition but dont worry im sure ill be able to get you your diploma in the fall oh my goodness well the whole thing is just ridiculous and as soon as the school board is back in session next fall im going to do everything i can to help you didnt principal jaffee call you the whole business with the art show and the newspaper its absolutely enid im so sorry about what happened let me know as soon as you can enid this could be a great thing for you well yes so what do you think as far as i know it includes housing and meals and everything it is really quite an offer well i know this is really short notice but i got a call from a very close friend at the academy of art design and she tells me that im allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program and well i hope you dont mind enid but i took the liberty of submitting your name dont worry its nothing bad i was just wondering what your plans were for next year enid can i talk to you for a minute and how does an image like this help us to see that and how do you think this addresses the subject of racism did you actually do this painting these are all valid comments but i think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this i see interesting and what was your reason for choosing him as your subject who is this enid and what can you tell us about this i think its really a wonderful piece margaret this shocking image of repressed femininity very good now what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent i can see that now what can you tell us about it first of all what kind of sculpture is this what do we have here margaret isnt this a wonderful piece class this definitely falls into that higher category of art i was speaking of earlier talk to us about it i think that phillip and enid can help us to see that there aremany different ways we can express ourselves we can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues emotional spiritual political of great importance i hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class who is responsible for thisid rather not i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul i could never forgive what youve done to me and my child we dont have a relationship i dont care who he is hes not taking my baby everybody has a choice if this is what the world will be like i dont want to live in it what do you want

regular sherlock holmes now what do you want what on earth gave you that idea yesyou would have had a full scale revolt on your hands do you want posters too not yet dear brother you want control of the crowd you cant get it by killing their hero you cant do that listen to the mood of the crowd by the emperor of rome this writer asks between a senate that debates truth until they choke an emperor who has the birth sign of a woman is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without encased in the armor of a demigod narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast if i ever loved narcissus it wasnt like you want what are you talking about the fans of narcissus they were on vigil outside the school of proximo they believe hes dying why are you so surly youve won brother the people have bread and the city is quiet taking my pleasure do i need to clear my lovers with you youre coming back you cant do that you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you why not do it in the colosseum if i may be so bold commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father except that he cant heave out his ghost those are priceless sculptures no one in rome has ever heard of him do you want to remind those few in the senate who have the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with forget about him im sure i dont know if you get me pregnant with a boy hell be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne maybe you should get married pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability dont you think you should at least wave and caesar lets not forget to serve caesar i was suddenly thinking about going to bed im tired of being stuck in that wagon thats what you told me two days ago where are we now commodus can you see the camp my gods the air is turning into ice hidden where my brother can not place hands on them he didnt have the guts to watch them die so i took care of it all the sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe narcissus i have your family theyre alive all of them marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son you can not die if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads but do you remember your epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans for the sake of the gods youre not leading these men how like my father you are you believe i guess thats why youre still alive but you do exist narcissus hero of the battle of the danube i came here to see that you stay alive the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero its my brothers neck you want not mine of course i know who do you think is paying for it the emperor himself didnt you know why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front burning patriotism filial love he wants to be sure when he takes over theres enough cash left in the treasury to play emperor watch out for him narcissus hes inexperienced but be careful how do you know i am playing well the clown is always harmless isnt that right and how did you ever get to know me so well the last we spent any time together i was fourteen i think you know me better than my father hes going to die isnt he why do you keep playing at being so humble its a little embarrassing without him hed be weeping if he overheard that well the idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities you know our two most senior senators gaius cantus and falco verus narcissus terrified you the only thing hes scared of is meyou teach them your daughters need more than some vapors they need you i dont want you to die narcissus youre not going you have to stay with us no i dont even want to imagine the things youve seen i never knew a more idealistic man than you let him trust quintus we dont need your help were doing great on our own who else im the one who runs the estates while youre here

me that and they have very mixed feelings about women they hate them in a way one reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently they can scrog them as you say for revenge wellpart of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long and make awful messes while theyre there its complicated and i dont want to go into it now because its bound to sound insultingeven though nobody means for anybody to be insulted its just the truth the whole concept of heroismand its sexual roots well i can some injuries spiritual or physical can be excruciating to me im not a silly carhop any more maybe youre right about fish when i was a carhop i didnt feel much more than a fish would but ive been sensitized i have ideas nowand solid information i know a lot more nowand a lot of it has to do with you id like to have the expert opinion of the fishalong with yours i will not be scrogged i remember one time i saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers and you promised me that the fish couldnt feel this is not a coy deception i do not want to be scrogged i want love i want tenderness

eightieth birthday oh i am happy harold ecstatically happy i couldnt imagine a lovelier farewell oh harold oh youve thought of everything and champagne oh harold you are so young i was remembering how much this meant to me it was after the war i had nothing except my life how different i was then and yet how the same harold that picture is almost twentyfive years old they mocked me they were representations of people i dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me and that in time all i would have left would be vague feelings but sharp photographs so i tossed them out my memory fades i know but i prefer pictures made by me with feeling and not by kodak with silver nitrate i took them out yes end where i began oh no but i should have liked to have been an astronaut a private astronaut able to just go out and explore like the men who sailed with magellan i want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world what a joke it will be if like them i we are alone you and me and everybody but we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in china is looking at them too someone we dont know and most likely will never see that someone is breathing along with us and the star gazers of the past from peasant to princes and the stargazers of the future all of us breathing and looking up there we are alone but look at the stars and never feel lonely i dont know perhaps yes theyre old friends well theyre my species right on it wouldnt be a celebration without it scared swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours i was petrified no it had nothing on this afternoon give me that im going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs dont you advance on me dont you talk to me like that you little foul mouth degenerate really sir i thought that you at least what with your skill and my experience i think we can come up with something theyd put you in jail eh well historically youd be in very good company thats what my husband used to say when we were in the french underground dealing with the gestapo would you like to do a little raking work im told done with no selfish interest purifies the mind you sink your separate self and become one with the universal self on the other hand senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided really just put it there harold well dont go but they cant do that you havent even got the vote what is it harold well be kind ive lived a long time harold seen evil as well as good and it has been my experience that kindness oh oh harold you make me feel like a schoolgirl from the guys who got the matches of course its sinking harold going over the horizon where we are all going to go its getting dark let each man hold on to his candle and get a light whereer he can no i feel more like yodeling harold everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves you just cant let the world judge you too much well why dont you with life pray no i communicate spreckled with uncountable stars the stars are shining right now we just cant see them just another instance of all thats going on that is beyond human perception its so blue i like you harold come ill teach you to waltz yes i understand a lot of people enjoy being dead but they are not dead really theyre just backing away from life theyre players but they sit on the bench the game goes on before them at any moment they can join in reach out take a chance get hurt maybe but play as well as you can go team go give me an l give me an i give me a v give me an e live otherwise youll have nothing to talk about in the locker room of course how ingenious tell me about them what was that me when i look around me i know i know nothing i remember though once long ago in persia we met a wise man in the bazaar he was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay his specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin the wisest he said the truest the most instructive words for all men at all times frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel i peered through a magnifying glass to read the words and this too shall pass away well the wise man was right if you remember that you cant help but live life fully well they say he was very wise so im sure he must have vice virtue its best not to be too moral you cheat yourself out of too much life aim above morality as confucius says dont simply be good make good things happen its all right its organic yes so do i but i think he is a little oldfashioned like a puff harold why therell be a new block of ice in the morning yes yes its almost there oh those motorcycles are awfully chilly i suppose i did well farewell little tree grow up tall and change and fall to replenish the earth isnt it wonderful harold all around us living things there oh i like the feel of soil dont you and the smell its the earth the earth is my body my head is in the stars who said that the old double uturn gets them every time is he ah the police always wanting to play games well here goes superb dont play anything dear me everyone should be able to make some music why its life rhythm and harmony thats the cosmic dance come with me oh that was fun lets play something together oh come on ill teach you oh yes every day but i dont need a defense anymore i embrace still fighting for the big issues but now in my small individual way shall we have a song no oh big issues liberty rights justice kings died and kingdoms fell i dont regret the kingdoms what sense in borders and nations and patriotism but i do miss the kings when i was a little girl i was taken to the palace in vienna to a garden party i can still see the sunshine the parasols and the flashing uniforms of the young officers i thought then i would marry a soldier later frederick would chide me about it he was so serious a doctor at the university and in the government my umbrella oh thats just a relic i found it when i was packing to come to america it used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition a long time ago some nuts some licorice it has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait oh its all right its organic a little afterdinner liqueur harold yes hes never finished one yet he has around him every kind of hand tool known to man but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake an ice sculpture its venus the goddess of love the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream well come back in the morning hes fallen asleep as usual oh my were too late yes youre right well go see glaucus come on exactly why not well transplant it to the forest look at it harold its suffocating its the smog people can live with it but it gives trees asthma they cant breathe see the leaves are all brown harold weve got to do something about this life that little tree its in trouble come on over there by the courthouse look the universal language of mankind what music do you like harold oh its only a machine harold its not as if it were alive like a horse or a camel we may live in a machine age but i simply cant treat them as equals of course the age has its advantages oooh but they are not look why do you say that i should like to change into a sunflower most of all they are so tall and simple and you harold what flower would you like to be well its all very thrilling of course but i ask you harold is it enough sterling silver it was my dear motherinlaws part of a dinner set of fifty pieces its one of the few things that survived oh but i do rattle on so tell me about yourself harold what do you do when you arent visiting funerals thats the influence of the right food the right exercise and the right breathing greet the dawn with the breath of fire of course theres no doubt the body is giving out im well into autumn ill have to be giving it all up after saturday sweeten the tea with

elephant do you like it oh im so happy you said that because i wanted to show you my paintings this is the rape of rome and of course there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of leda and the swan really do you think its wrong heavens no i dont have the time but i like to keep in practice and poor glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form do you disapprove she seemed yare to me ill heat some up my its nice to see you again harold hows your hearse how about some ginger pie harold promise my door is always open well then you must come back and visit oh at the dentists well then but its oat straw tea youve never had oat straw tea have you shes very sweet but so old fashioned please sit down harold ill put on the kettle and well have a nice hot cup of tea oh look the birds its all memorabilia but incidental and not integral if you know what i mean well if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things then im merely acting as a gentle reminder im sort of breaking it easy here today gone tomorrow so dont get attached to things now with that in mind im not against collecting stuff what owners harold we dont own anything its a transitory world we come on the earth with nothing and we go out with nothing so isnt ownership a little absurd not any car i like to keep a variety im always looking for the new experience like this one i liked it of course ive had to make some additions for the new models but not as many as you might think once you have your basic set its then only a question of variation oh your hearse well its a new experience for me good on curves shall i take you home harold oh so do i theyre such fun arent they its all change all revolving burials and births the end to the beginning and the beginning to the end the great circle of life my this old thing handles well ever drive a hearse harold no i thought not do you sing and dance do you dance well then i must be off we shall

fine i got ta go goodbye its gon na be fine these people are ready for anything well youve asked i mean maybe youre right but were you really expecting me to say yes ive changed my mind thats the most romantic thing ive ever heard i do i will about what so no i dont think so im just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days fair enough very persuasive dont sulk what brought all this on no probably not well forgive me if i dont think of you as the worlds safest bet im sorry but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you i know ha ha ha hoo hoo hoo what are you going to talk to me about right are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out are you worried about tomorrow night thats okay you seem pissed off all the time though we took care of that theyll go on early nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cant play for more than a half hour yeah his band is playing a set barry said its done what do you ever do that cant be cancelled i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we werent together anymore it might even be why i came back just local of course yeah and he said its a good way to break out a record especially for what he said and i quote would be a highly anticipated event locally he helped me put out a press release i called dan koretzky because he i tricked you into meeting some people youd think were great i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way i know but youve never met it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him at paul and mirandas paul from work wan na go to dinner hi what are you doing all im saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself otherwise whats the use how what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice yeah youre alright but youre certainly not happy so what happens if you get happy and yes i know thats the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention should we split up because im used to you being miserable what happens if you i dont know start youre own record label and its a success time for a new girlfriend less neurotic are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life more confident maybe i cant go to work with my hair dyed pink and i can afford to go shopping more now and ive met a couple people i like over the last year or so you havent changed so much as a pair of socks in the years ive known you if weve grown apart then im the one whos done the growing and all ive done is change jobs but what because im not allowed to i still do after work so what should we just break up is that what youre saying because if you are im going to run out of patience how how were we the same people money does not matter i do not care how much you earn id just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like ill pay for you even though you owe me money we have to do something with the money i earn i need to i deserve it you can just think of it as winning the lottery like mexico or jamaica or new york even look rob if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now and that is my last word on the subject okay to make you feel better well i was gon na lie and now i cant because youd know i was lying look were okay now we just had a nice time lets leave it at that whats the difference it was like sex what else could it be like want to know what exactly lets go home okay i know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage im sure i just i need you rob thats it and we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so rays a disaster i dont know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and blow it all apart everythings too hard maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i dont im too tired not to go out with you i lived with you you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now youre worried i might kill you and youre entitled to worry isnt that a terrible thing isnt that sad yes of course theres nothing to worry about oh rob were not going to go through that again i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today hello it doesnt seem so long ago that i looked at you from here itll have to be sex then i want to feel something else than this its either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm i dont know sometime later listen rob would you have sex with me cmon i dont want to go back i didnt mess things up because i was scared i slept with ray because i was sick of you and i needed something to snap me out of it thank you i appreciate it i cant reciprocate youre also an idiot youre soaking are you going to lie in that flower bed all night lizll give you a lift she knows where to go and everything i dont have time to talk rob ive got too much to do look are you coming or not i dont care as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand my dad liked you and mom never told him wed split because he wasnt up to it and oh i dont know i dont really understand it i think she thinks hell be able to see whats going on its like hes been through so much what with dying and everything that she doesnt want to upset him any more than she has to in a minute when i get it together im sorry my dad died my dad my dad pig died pigsty i cant talk right now hello well think about it youre being deliberately obtuse im sorry to go on about it but i dont know theres a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it theyre not really though are they i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you i cant take them i know theyd just sit around staring at me and id feel embarrassed by them and they dont fit in with the rest of whats mine do you understand that sting record you bought for me that was a present for me i like sting and you hate him but the rest of this stuff who the hell is nick lowe or gram parsons or the boredoms i dont know these people i those arent mine oh ho so very infrequently mmm hmm you make me laugh much more than ray does if thats what youre getting at but i already knew you could make me laugh its everything else i dont know about ray i hate ian you know i didnt mind and its not as if rays place is any better fix it up itll make you feel better you know what i mean i dont really want to talk about it to be honest im sure hes at home listen i cant believe he went to the store im mortified actually im really sorry he had no right to do that and i told him so yep i might have missed some stuff im so used to some things being here that i dont even notice them i called and called but you were out i thought id be gone before you got back you dont ever think about other people im not experimenting why dont you go experiment jesus i do not know ill talk to you later im not hold on i figured it was where are you hello call me at work we can arrange to meet properly i dont want this to be the last conversation we have i know what youre like will you call me we can meet for another drink if you want so i can explain it better i owe you that much and anyway i keep trying to tell you thats not really the point is it the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob are you there what are you thinking you must have known it would happen you couldnt have been entirely unprepared like you said ive been living with the guy we were bound to get around to it sometime oh rob what do you want me to say is that why you wanted to see me i told you i slept with him so how are you well talk some other time im sorry to call but i need that stuff hi ive been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and im thinking i didnt take them with me have you seen them around will you please just go no i was living with you remember weve slept together but we havent made love not yet but ill tell you one thing the sleeping together is better i havent felt like it well the answer is that i dont know either we havent done it yet you really think it would make a difference either way jesus christ rob is that really whats bothering you is what better better than what just ask it nevermind fine one im too tired for this now i know im asking a lot but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up i need to be able to think while i do it and i cant think while youre here okay okay we have a nine percent chance of getting back together does that clarify the situation i dont fucking know what chance you fucking have oh rob shut up i suppose so i dont know look maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me maybe ill never see either of you again i dont know all i know is that its not a good time to be living here i am not living with him ive just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what im doing look this has nothing to do with anyone else you know that dont you i left because we werent exactly getting along and we werent talking about it and i suddenly realized that i like my job and i like what my life is could be turning into and that im getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cant really see that ever happening with you and yeah yeah i sort of get interested in someone else and that went further than it should have so it seemed like a good time to go but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run probably nothing rob dont be childish did you say something what i guess its not that obvious then whats the obvious stuff what were the others what gim me a fucking break is that what you think that your not big enough a deal for me jesus gim me a little credit rob im sorry i havent been very fair to you thats why i came here to the store this evening i feel terrible rob this is really hard you know i think you know that have you tackled the great reorganization yet and do you like it that way you really believe that yeah sure more so then than i am now thats life though isnt it well i liked you you were a deejay and i thought you were hot and i didnt have a boyfriend and i wanted one i remember the song i just couldnt remember who sang it is that right id like a word with him and who says i like marvin gaye anyway whatever and the israelis and the palestinians dont art garfunkel and marvin gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute and the israelis and the palestinians are art garfunkel and marvin gaye its not like saying that at all actually rob art garfunkel and marvin gaye make pop records yes well im coming over to your house to get some things i thought i could give you a lift back hi i should be so lucky weve done the hard part now i might as well you knowif by we you are referring to men then i have to say that just the once would do maybe ive been a little unfair but is this really the time enough of what no they dont know him and ken liked you rob ken didnt die for your benefit you know its like everybodys a supporting actor in the film of your life story what difference does it make its a crematorium rob two years ago you got laura pregnant you then proceeded to cheat on her you borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back and then just a few weeks ago you told her you were unhappy with her and were kind of looking around for somebody else to think i sympathized with you for two seconds poor rob laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs you let me believe that no no no dont even i talked to laura rob i talked to her and she gave me a little background and youre a fucking asshole yeah like i said i dont want to take sides and i like laura with you shes more fun more open you guys are good together i just wish you two could i dont know i dont think much of this ian guy howre you holding up you called this morning hey its lizright and so it is ill talk to you later that way you god you ask a lot of questions good so youll stay jesus so much for delicacy i pegged you for a master of understatement beating around the bush and all that buzz id like it if you could stay the night when i said before that i hoped it wasnt the end of the evening i was you know talking about breakfast and stuff tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees rob standing and holding his jacket good in that case ill fix us something else to drink you sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee for now but i wouldnt be if i thought this was the end of the evening are you okay you havent even seen it the conformist yeah i know the crumblers i bought a used blasters album in new york about ten years ago and somebody left a crumblers single in it my everything changed for a couple of weeks yeah but if you heard this band called the crumblers youd no way id cramp his style and i wouldnt want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall im way to unattached for that yup thank you god i hate that time that pick up stuff time i just went through that before i came here you know that song patsy cline times two i play thats about me and my ex dividing up our record collections everything go alright dont you like that yup not far from here actually good cause im enjoying myselfwell i dont know what happens now apart from you meet someone you move in she goes you meet someone you move in she goes so you say id like to hear her side of it what did laura say do you know why she left i knew this was going to happen and after that i knew this would happen what are you going to do rob you know thats not whats upsetting me well call her mother what do you mean where did she go your lucky lauras doing so well if it wasnt for her i dont think either of us would ever sleep hows the store everything all right hi rob its your motherokay because you took the trouble to come up here and because youve got principles but thats it im not selling them to you one by one sure ten cents fine with eleven hundred he could come home and thats the last thing i want and i wont take a penny over ninety seventyfive sixty suit yourself there are plenty of others who will that wasnt part of the deal i want to be poisonous but fair years this collection is as close as hes ever come to an achievement hes in jamaica with a twentythree yearold a friend of my daughters he had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and i told him to fuck off so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever i go minus a ten percent commission which reminds me can you make sure you give me a five i want to frame it and put it on the wall i must have nothing their my husbands i know what theyre worth give me fifty and get them out give me fifty bucks and theyre all yours what do you thinkgo to hell sure mr congeniality let him find his own clues theres a journal article in this somewhere yeah pd says 41 but he barely looks 30 dr kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral the father looked just like richard even had a mark on his cheek some guy named smith was asking about him in church hill i passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank so he isnt a cop district anyway i cant figure out why hes doing it hes been richard taupin at least since 1967 and the guys rich you should see the stuff he has in that shop its in good condition scottish claymore take a french epee add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business and youve got a claymore claymore didnt think it was my buddy over there fine doesnt have a head does he thanks its my birthday there was a count count dusan he would invite the local peasants to his chateau fill them full of wine then slice their bellies so he could reuse it the symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me would you remember his name have you spoken to anyone else about this the boy died i dont follow you ive been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies then you didnt know richard later on why no thank you im fine church hill thats pretty close isnt it you owe me besides im cute sos playing choochoo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of yes you have lived forever the inheritance no what is it whats wrong will i see you again what is it you want but youre known so much history ill only read about what is it like being you damn you dont is that a threat you kill with your left hand you and your buddy make a real team dont you exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between what about that family in 31 you killed those other two of bodies thats insane what could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction he knows about you thats why smith called you macleod id like you to try who are you just a little crazy my life has been chock full of people with complications and weak nesses i cant stand it but youre different its in your hands a clarity im not even sure why ive been telling myself its the award winning journal article im going to write but its not its you i must be insane leaving work ditching cops all to follow a murderer a very old murderer but a murderer just the same i hope i never get that old its frightening sometimes the way you talk about other peoples lives thats impossible then you must be at least 70 years old youre using your sons name and you are william taupin arent you william taupin seems to have left his mark i dont know any of these ill make a fool of myself its beautiful theres a catch youre supposed to wear 19th century clothing i thought it might be a nice break from all of this its some sort of party the town is throwing well as long as were stuck here no so what now we just wait the estate stuff is pretty straight forward just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat yes you want me to front for you you make it all sound so simple when you finish what then you did kill those men whats all that our cars were seen together in felton theyre calling me an accessory to murder is this what you killed them with maybe youre wrong no i had to talk to you no are you im a historian mr taupin only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face id rather hear yours no im a witness to a murder that seems to put me pretty high on your friends chop list what about me he was innocent i left a man dead in felton but you dont really care do you he called you macleod what will you do now and you who is he dupont circle he tried to kill me last night what the hell is going on why not jesus christ i have friends ive been to church hill i think you do better yet i dont think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place and i think mr smith whoever he is now knows that does carl smith who grave robbers someone beat you good reflexes charming guy basil once after beating an army of serbians he blinded all but byzantine its quite rare you know some thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years

now well talk about it at the table dinners getting cold what are you doing in here jim dinners just about ready ive got a surprise for you tried something new jim jim dinneror a cover up jesus bill dont you have enough proof of the fbis complicity now no shaw director of the trade mart this is incredible who you want facts bill okay from 1945 to 59 only two us soldiers defect to russia from 59 to 60 seven defect six return one of them another marine a month before oswald all of them young men made to seem poor disenchanted i dont know if its coincidence but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan six months after he arrives in russia francis gary powers u2 spy flight goes down in russia that plane was untouchable powers hinted that oswald couldve given the russians enough data to hit it as a direct result the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed i cant help thinking of that book seven days in may maybe someone in our military didnt want the peace conference to happen maybe oswald was part of that it gets weirder yes but were talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance three years later and hes still classified they gave us his grammar school records a study of his pubic hairs put it in context bill of what we know about oswald lonely kid no father unstable childhood high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy joins the marines at 17 he learns russian he acts overtly marxist with two other marines but hes stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate hes discharged from the marines supposedly because his mothers sick he stays home 3 days then with a 1500 ticket from a 203 bank account he goes to moscow im sorry arent you being a little hard this is interesting are you ready for this oswald went to see the fbi two weeks before the assassination it seems special agent hosty made three routine visits to his house supposedly to keep an eye on marina oswald bugging the district attorneys office of new orleans its outrageous now it gets positively spooky in january 1961 in new orleans at the bolton ford dealership when the oswald we know is in russia there is a man using the name oswald to buy trucks for the friends of democratic cuba the salesman never saw him again but guess whos on the articles of incorporation of the friends of democratic cuba guy banister banister has someone using the name oswald to buy the trucks hoover at the fbi writes a memo dated june 1960 that there could be someone using oswalds passport and identity all i can find out about the williams is their tax returns are classified and that bill williams a descendant of the cabots of massachusetts has links through his family and united fruit to the cia and does classified work for bell helicopter which requires a security clearance so what is oswald a defector doing visiting his wife in his house williams has a relationship at bell with general walter dornberger another one of the nazis we brought in after the war for our missile program he used slave labor to build the v2 rockets for hitler before bell needed him the oswalds are introduced by george de mohrenschildt to janet and bill williams its through janet williams in october 63 that lee gets the warehouse job right smack on elm street at the book depository which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists the next thing we know hes living in dallasft worth in october 62 working 6 months at jaggarschiles stovall a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the us army he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man whod been in the army security agency none either its bizarre its next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in 63 a man who has defected once already its crazy spas t raikin a leading member of an anticommunist group the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type none the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel hes never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or as far as we know debriefed by the cia but he never writes speaks or does any propaganda for the russians he meets marina whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence at a trade union dance she thinks hes russian the way he speaks six weeks later they marry have a daughter finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has hes given 5000 rubles a roomy apartment with a balcony has affairs with local girls negative on his tax records classified first time i know a da cant get a tax record i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them there are about 1200 documents oswald in the ussr in mexico city oswald and the u2 a cia 201 personnel file a memo from the director on oswald travel and activities cant get one of them all classified as secret on the grounds of national security its real strangei keep thinking of that day tuesday the 26th the day after they buried kennedy lbj was signing the memorandum on vietnam with ambassador lodge it never did i knew the man 20 years thats him the way he walked arms at his side military the stoop the haircut the twisted left hand the large class ring what was he doing there if anyone had asked him hed probably say protection but ill tell you i think he was giving some kind of okay signal to those hoboes theyre about to get booked and hes telling em its gon na be okay theyre covered and in fact they were you never heard of them again does it matter another technician but an interesting thing he was there that day in dealey plaza you know how i know that picture of yours the hoboes you never looked deep enough you never ask a spook a question no point hell never give you a straight answer general y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more got promoted to two stars but he was never military you know always cia went to vietnam lost his credibility when we got beat over there retired lives in virginia i say hello to him when i see him at the supermarket dont think so when they start to drool they get rid of em these guys are proud of what they did they did dealey plaza they took out the president of the united states thats entertainment and they served their country doing it hes done it before other countries lumumba in the congo trujillo the dominican republic hes working on castro no big deal in september kennedy announces the texas trip at that moment second oswalds start popping up all over dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket y flies in the assassins maybe from the special camp we keep outside athens greece pros maybe some locals cubans maria hire separate teams does it really matter who shot from what rooftop part of the scenery the assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone i think it started in the wind money arms big oil pentagon people contractors bankers politicians like lbj were committed to a war in southeast asia as early as 61 they knew kennedy was going to change things he was not going to war in southeast asia who knows probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere houston new york hell maybe bonn germany who knows its international now you didnt get that break you needed but you went as far as any man could bubba what can i do for you but you dont have a choice anymore youve become a significant threat to the national security structure they wouldve killed you already but you got a lot of light on you instead theyre gon na destroy your credibility they already have in many circles in this town youre some kinda egocrazed southern caricature to many folks be honest the best chance you got is come up with a case something anything make arrests stir the shitstorm you got ta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack remember fundamentally people are suckers for the truth and the truth is on your side bubba i hope you get a break no chance in hell mr garrison id be arrested and gagged declared insane and hospitalized maybe worse you too i can only give you background you got to find the foreground the little things keep digging yknow youre the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of john kennedy thats important its historic kings are

his exact words you dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it hes setting me up to make a proposition maybe but im thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself i know i got your message ray wanted to have dinner he wanted to talk about the sting were plotting thats what he calls it a sting hes being real nice to me yeah we were goin over everything thats why all the bags im helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him right around here in the food court he always just picked it up at my

otherwise fuck em same way i been doin but first they got to let me go back to work he needs me without me all that money is just gon na sit over there in cabo sugar he had his doubts at first but hes always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can we talked he came by he told me last night its a lot of money about a halfa million dollars all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordells money i dont know yet im going to talk with dargus and nicolet today do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens i called in sick this morning as far as the airline knows im still available 74 i think the delfonics uhhuh i got a few but i cant afford to start all over again i got too much time and money invested in my records i couldnt wait till i got home last night and wash my hair want to hear some music yeah what i couldnt hear you thanks but i have my own now i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail i am have a seat i think maybe i have more options than i thought but if all i can give em is ordells name i dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it that dont give me much to bargain with yeah if i cooperate whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened this aint solvin my problem i got ta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble im off today but if i cant leave the country im out of a job and if i dont got a job i cant hire a lawyer thats it hes cash poor he kept on me till i finally said okay ill bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr walker in mexico gave me the envelope its all in lock boxes in a mexico bank but hes got a problem hes what do you call it when you got money but dont have cash with ten thousand nine i used to bring over ten thousand at a time thats the legal limit so i never brought more than that i have a pretty good idea ordell aint no bootlegger and i doubt hes smugglin cuban cigars so that only leaves one thing an atf man would be interested in it was the other guy who busted me ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms i didnt the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont ordell pick up his bond thats him how do you know em who gave me the money and who i was giving it to and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off said it was him who told them bout me i had em too i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down then their asses lucked out and found that coke yeah but thats not what this was about they were fuckin waitin for my ass they knew i had that money they even knew the amount the one who searched my bag from lapd dargus hardly even looked at it oh id say theres fifty thousand here what would you say but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs and i could tell they didnt want to do that sure shit so far ive been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe or i can stand mute and get as much as five years does that sound right youre not tired of it she was more helpful than the fuckin public defender i dont know i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are davidoffs i get em in mexico theyre hard to find here i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin her boyfriends head open with a baseball bat thats why i dont quit if i cant fly anymore im gon na have a bitch of a time gettin my brand you gain weight cause i look like i just got outta jail thats why you droppin me off at home right theres a place by me that doesnt sound dark is it dark id love one but not there couldnt we just stop at a seven eleven i dont think so can we stop for cigarettes who put up my bond ordell can i see your id are you really a bail bondsman okay if i dont cooperate what if i plead guilty whos side are you on you tell those guys theyll have to do one helluva lot better than that before ill even say hi to them well sheronda it was nice talking to you you know whats in the bag youre taking then you dont see him for a few days not every day do you live together do you think i took some of that money what about me so what happens now i thought you were watching him if itll make you happy i have no idea i didnt see him i was in my underwear if it was a white guy it was probably louis he kill melanie not in the fitting room i went looking for you i went straight to the bookstore cause thats where you were last time but you werent there how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened you didnt tell me how to do that did you i knew i was under surveillance so when i couldnt spot anybody i started yelling i had to i was frantic i didnt know what to do she didnt give me one i told you before melanie wasnt part of the plan ordell must of told her to do it she bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off what am i supposed to do go after her im in my fucking underwear i had to get dressed before i could do anything so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform because i didnt have it ray i swear melanie came in and grabbed it and someone killed her for it i got there early ive had my eye on this suit wait lets start over i got there early the idea was to try on the suit see if i liked it if i did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform thats what sherondas expecting me to wear go meet sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home i thought i did si how can i do anything if im being watched every second that would be one point of view yes all those things are true uhhuh ever been tempted i never have its not my money i was told ten thousand in each pack we could if im not in jail you said that the last time right everythings the same except one change uhhuh she didnt say uhhuh i smiled and walked away she also told me ordell killed beaumont im sure that was the idea it was her coke i got busted with she knows everything but shes not part of it and shes pissed cause shes not part of it ordell wouldnt even let her stay at the meeting she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell white girl named melanie ralston another girlfriend of ordells not yet i imagine shit needs to be done what for not really this afternoon before i came here he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach i dont know if he lives there but i can find out ordell has a white guy working for him named louis a broadway shopping bag i thought you were going to let this one through what are you doing short of wearing a wire ill do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail and in exchange for my help i need permission to leave the country and immunity he told me besides why else would an atf man be after him no he sells guns you never asked me if i did or not if im working i can help you i need it tomorrow if i dont show up for work tomorrow im fired i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job can i smoke look that shit aint mine you planted that shit on me what the fuck is that shit yeah now be careful with that bag you dont want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store i put a little cherry on top youre right what the hell he ever do for us do you got something for me yeah do you like it hi melanie i dont think so but thanks for the beer keep it between us girls dreaming kinda beaumont livingston he said he didnt know about it that coke was yours wasnt it what were you two

like what does she think shes gettin are you sure she dont know about the money it washes off i tell them were doing it the same way as before theyll follow sheronda i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills not when its my ass on the line you dont we do this my way or fuck it i know but i hung around cause i figured youd try an pull some shit like this i was there i saw her do it sheronda passin the money onto someone else thats what the hell im talkin bout i dont want no more fuckin surprises we do this the way i laid it out or we

the ten thousand to someone you dont have to i told em youre real careful you never pick up money yourself you always send someone and i never know who it is i make two deliveries the first one with ten thousand like a dry run they watch it see how it works then we do a second delivery when i bring in the half mill they know im delivering for you i mention the halfmillion they dont give a fuck

dumb horney and he just pulled me over to the bed and they were in the room like getting dressed like getting ready to go to go to disco yeah it depends cause like this one time with eric when we got blasted at his house and smash j and dj flipper was there its really slow its slow boring yeah its like making love is like right you know its not like you know theres a difference between sex making love and fucking you can drink like theres no tomorrow but you still cant get that sperm between the teeth out its so disgusting no no no you cant get that taste out of your mouth until you eat something it was it was to come he was like sucking my tits he was fucking fingering me but that shit was nice and hard and we were like underneath the sheets we were going at it like crazy oh my god that shit was so good it was like hard its very monotonous its grandmother style that shit is nothin i remember i had just turned 14 with this fuckin asshole who was like 18 i dont even remember his name i think it was john or jake or something i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shitthrough a rental agency ten days ago you know i hate to say i told you so but i warned her coming home at all hours of the night a young girl new to the city this neighborhood aint what it used to beyou couldnt find your dick in a wind storm it isnt him frank you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this remember eventually revenge is carefully have you tired juxtaposing the words he was with me it doesnt make sense because we dont understand it now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious what do you mean stand out a few people maybe youre reaching a bit i think sanderson should be in on this theres a reason why the killers calling him sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing but who called him today hes one of the best chess players in the world who better to play a game with you werent mad at him for picking up the phone i think your mother knows that now why dont you put the knife down put it down david i know but this isnt going to bring her back yes i do i found your file i know what happened this isnt going to help david youre mothers dead you cant undo it yeah thats what weve always thought but what if he wasnt what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here come here why did he he already did once im just nervous sorry how come the police never had a record of sanderson before this doesnt come out of nowhere there has to be a history i just cant believe it fuck off dont patronize me you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didnt warn me the same type as the girl who got killed jesus alan the guy could be a psychopath you could have been honest with me for starters we work together i have to be able to trust you oh well we wouldnt want to disturb your guests would we youre damn right im a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer nice meeting you how do you know that did he say something of course thats only because you dont know where to go you like hiking fishing sailing what do you like so are you having a good time on the island is your dad here im kathy you must be erica ive got a room at the institute i use when i stay late no he was wearing a mask but i saw the cut on his wrist it was peter you dont have a shred of evidence this stinks you want to know what i think i think there have been five murders and youve got shit to go on you need to blame someone and hes the easiest choice and what if hes wrong if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you wouldve arrested him if it is someone else then hes going to kill again tonight and youre sitting here ignoring the message what does that mean what are you saying that im seeing what i want to see that im protecting a murderer what about a quarter to one as large as castles each of those grids represents almost a square mile he moves around a lot why i thought that homesearchers was a dead end well i think you have to play to his ego he thinks hes superior the more secure he feels the more chances hell take peters right captain hes got to be forced into making a mistake i know that ive seen the photos his home would be mount olympus meaning i would think its some type of clue as to where hes going to kill next yes why disguise your voice if no one knows it that would indicate hes playing out a fantasy powercontrol killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them once they become a reality though they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it but in all the research ive read on serial killers ive never heard of one moving so fast its as if the game is the catalyst for the murders not the other way around well the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim but we heard him edmonds i know you lost to karpov in 82 didnt you i see youre still having problems with your openings im busy right now what do you think he did only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case youre working on whatd he do im a psychologist frank not a psychic whats this all about anyway well what i told you this was a stupid idea you cant learn anything from someone in a few minutes what are they please could you please do me a big favor in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess could you look and tell me what they are sara this is doctor sheppard i called you earlier about a book thank you im at 6397393 hi sara this is doctor sheppard i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called principals and tactics by anton berger i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future theres a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you you made a difference you beat him yeah ill be there later youre going to be late for your match of course not he didnt tell you either no he didnt how did you know it was carefully it could be anything maybe youre afraid of what it says why not why of course it isnt its always difficult when someone you love dies but you cant feel responsible because she had a car accident then help me to understand i want to understand youre wife died you cant feel responsible for that thats still no excuse you treat everything like a game peter i want someone i can get close to i dont know if thats possible with you im not looking for an apology peter hi because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid what but what does he mean by a fierce magazine violent for emphasis peter peter you have to admit nothing i tried again and got through theyre not delivering im going to go pick up the pizza the line was busy ill try again would you settle for pepperoni what do you want on it im hungry you can turn everything around so easily this is not just another game is it i said i didnt plan on getting involved youve got to face the things you feel then show me who you are does anyone nobody could attack you you set your life up like one of your chessboards youre impregnable but at the same time youve become trapped behind your own defenses youre cut off from everyone around you im just trying to get to know you peter yes you are youre

pawn your watch lets stay for a while yes one of my friends was there i wonder if you ever clipped her where was that house the one in la i mean years ago in la i turned a trick on sunset and western the guy was polite and didnt argue about the price he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room the room had a bed and a dresser he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up i felt kind of guilty because he hadnt come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes but he said it was all right and began dressing when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and hugged me and kissed me on the cheek he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car i remember being relieved that i wouldnt have to work again that evening shall we go away for a couple of days ill be back home around three if youre back by then we can watch tv or something i guess what im saying is that i hope you are back when i get home please be careful they wouldnt know do you want me not to go tonight yes ill give you that i dont understand any of that what was that all about your color very creative now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers be careful heres my speech i know this shouldnt be acceptable to me but it is dont ask me why i sense that your trouble is very big and im scared for you and so im doing what i think you need me to do falling down in casinos is little stuff it doesnt bother me it has nothing to do with us you were ok for a while so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck but i think even you knew that wasnt going to happen we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store even though i told you that we had plenty at home in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change i asked you if you knew it was a hundred you said you did so i let you do it we got here you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home i also promised that we would never come in there again i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me not like you wanted to hit me but more just waving me away security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street but i talked them into letting me walk you out well i was prepared for worse but it wasnt so bad we were sitting at the bar talking about blackjack you seemed just fine a little drunker than usual but nothing really strange but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then wham you swung you arm at me and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress you smashed everything on her tray it was a real mess you kept yelling and yelling how are you doing i expect some kind of loyalty here just because i fuck for money doesnt give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly well then i hope we dont run into any tonight tomorrow night as a matter of fact i am planning to go out and do some work then come im going to change watch tv ill be half an hour do you want to go gambling tonight we could go out and play for a few hours nice talk ben keep drinking in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool some

father and if you in fact heard the gunshot then brooke windham wouldnt have had time to hide the gun before you got downstairs which would mean that you wouldve had to have found mrs windham with a gun in her hand to make your story sound plausible isnt that right thats right because isnt the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twentyfour hours after getting a perm at the risk of deactivating the ammonium thiglycolate chutney why is it that tracy marcinkos curls were ruined when she got hosed down you know a girl in my sorority tracy

perm before miss windham where you got in the shower miss windham can you tell us what youd been doing earlier in the day but you didnt hear the shot because you were in the shower so at some point in the twenty minutes you were in the shower your father was shot did you hear a shot fired but mrs windham didnt have a gun and when you came downstairs what happened okay ms windham when you uh arrived back at the house was your father there tell him paulette due to the fact that you retained the residence ms bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be

forgiven for sending for you why would you like to wring my little neck why mother i was just going to why struggling why why goodness no from what you tell me about it it certainly doesnt sound very attractive you see its not a dream bump im sure of it just as im sure theres a wish for shangrila in everyones heart i have never seen the outside world but i understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy yet i just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security where theres beauty and comfort where they wouldnt have to be mean and greedy oh i just wish the whole world might come to this valley perhaps because youve always been a part of shangrila without knowing it im so glad im sorry i thought i was to be the light but why do i confuse you am i so strange what is im thirty yes i know well i was almost born here it took place in that wild country beyond the pass my father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year when chang found us only father and i were alive but he was too weak to climb the pass he died on the way i was brought up here by father perrault himself ill help you to begin with youd like to know what im doing here whether i was born here i really only brought you here to show you my pigeons yes as a matter of fact all i saw was a little boy whistling in the dark oh i know it was full of this and full of that but you were accomplishing nothing you were going nowhere and you knew it i saw a man whose life was empty that was easy i read your books yes hold this pigeon oh you mean my pigeons my names sondrayeah what are you doing are you sure you dont the only thing i could think of would be youd have to get rid of the queen out of focus what the hell does that mean what do we do it wouldve had to have been recently within a few weeks man hey maybe you are an entopologist after all its the most amazing insect nest ive ever seen and ill tell you one thing it sure as hell aint the andean mollatoosa i swear to god that was not here two days ago well first of all its entomologist i dont think so i mean him he could be a scientist maybe but you exterminator id understand but entopolgist no way its hard to find its an old civil war cemetery nobody ever goes there so what is it you say you do once just once i thought id made the discovery of a lifetime do have any idea what i just said with exclusionary frectoinhibitors yeah right even i can barely read all my work so howd you hear about this or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare i really like that let the other girls have the guys like you chiseled jaw perfect nose quirky dimples i find you all so boring actually they disgust me but thats what i love about them like a car wrack you know how you shouldnt look but you always pull over and watch real close or even pretend youre a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures really nice wheels by the way seriously im not going any further until you tell who you are the what hmnn wall its funny cause usually im not all that attracted to stupid guys but come again i mean i dunno ive seen insects with really great camoflauge ability but never like this yeah nov i know it looks normal but watch this scientific american reallyrun im sorry john but you have to run again shes not alive but she didnt die she grew up the drowning woman anne but it was too late her little girl was already gone cant you see she just wanted her little girl back i am going back i see myself there i always wondered what the world would be like but now that ive seen it i dont need to see any more its all right once im in the tank i wont remember any of this the other two will die without me i have to go back where are we going but you still have a choice the others never had a chance to see their future you did please i want to go back anderton what is it please anderton leave wait he wont no follow him do it right here on the ground drop some money can you see the balloon man take it theyre inside is it now is it now can you seethe female its always in the more gifted of the three sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark actually i think youll have to run out but yes thats what you have to do if you have one inside the precog who predicted it all you have to do is download it the safest place of all i said the record is destroyed the original report exists for all time i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place but not declared you shouldnt you shouldnt trust anyone certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself not the young federal agent who wants your job not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what hes created dont trust anyone just find the minority report hold that thought but you will bring it down if you kill leo crow why that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime didnt work do you really the system would collapse yes of course he knew but at the time he felt we both felt their existence was an insignificant variable i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are im saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future obviously for precrime to function there cant be any suggestion of fallibility after all what good is a justice system that instills doubt it may be reasonable but its still doubt because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur most of the time all three precognitives will see an event in the same way but once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two i cant help you no one can the precogs are never wrong how can you avoid a man youve never met and yet a chain of events has started a chain that will lead inexorably to his death so many of them despite what we did for them or maybe because of what we did to them it doesnt matter its a perfect system now isnt it back then he was still a da and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom you have to understand these people were the dregs of society but once they saw their children he decided he would do whatever he could for them hes that way you know paternal about certain things precrime the precogs you it began as play a guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right and then the nightmares started they were all different but all the same they were all about murder and the murders were all happening you think the three in the tank come from a test tube theyre merely the ones who survived the innocents we now use to stop the guilty im not i was trying to heal them not turn them into something else if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes i invented precrime and how would i know that just what is it you think i can do for you you have three minutes to tell me what youre doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants the vine the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall yes im afraid that would be from the dolls eye something wrongjohn what is it i know i do too about who think john why would they set you up found where then who was he then how did he oh god what did you do john anne lively but i never said she drowned lamar no i dont think you do the other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but danny witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed he didnt mention him he didnt say his name even once no thats what everyone thinks john shot a man dead in baltimore six months before lamar do you know the reason why john came here to work with you he also said crow was a fake john said something about him being set up because he found out about her anne lively john was talking about her right before they took him i thought you were retiring you look great no it isnt lamar there was nothing anyone could do i havent seen him in two years to what trap him i left him because every time i looked at him i saw my son every time i got close to him i smelled my little boy thats why i left him and now you can leave he shot a hole in the damn ceiling so what you lose your son lets see how well you handle it the fbi found something that belonged to my son a sandal anyway john was upset he he it wasnt a suicide attempt i regret ever saying that yes it was nobodys fault since right after we lost our son that was our apartment no but then i dont talk to john that much anymore no i dont have any sugar either we used to every summer i dont have any cream sorry thanks you take anything in your coffee yes i know who you arei want you to take her

about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make outsville and do all these highly romantic activities hello yes and that is what i have got right now i have taken my feelings of gratitude and relief and transferred them onto you i have taken all those warm grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you so that now i am under the delusion that i am in love with you transference i know a little about psychology i took three different courses in college its true none of them were above the two hundred level but i took them and there was one concept i remember very well the point is this i am not a blank page i did not just fall off the turnip truck do you know what i mean im saying that since im doing so much better which i attribute to you im liable to misinterpret some of my feelings given that im obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way first of all i have been feeling much better lately i dont know if the syndrome is over if its just run its course or something but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you all right im going to come right out and say this because thats what your shrink is for right so you can tell him whats bothering you no it is not something ive heard about you it is someth why is there something i should have heard about you how intuitive that must take years of training right there maybe you can guess what has upset me yes somethings very wrong dr mumford it mightve been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctorpatient relationship i need to talk to you doctor can i come in thanks to this therapy i now know what im looking for i need to find a man like you not one whos treating me of course and im going to do it dammit youve given me the confidence youre shockingly honest thats what makes you great ive never had a man treat me this way with you i feel really listened to can i tell you something its a little embarrassing but i feel very unguarded with you yes and my exhusband he never accepted me for who i was just like mother the things youve said have helped me understand what a dick he is i cant tell you how much i admire you you have a wonderful way with people and youre very insightful i feel like youve seen me clearly i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was youve made that possible for me youve been a tremendous help to me i bet i know what changed your mind my mother she was so horrible you decided you couldnt desert me my brother said you were about to fire me whyd you come to the house the other night which thing when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down and this is legitimate therapy its all right im thinking a gal could make a good living doing this how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old and hes where so whose route is this no thatd be a good story but that was just the beginning of the end we went on for another year or so and ill bet you can interpret the whole thing that was really bad wasnt it who thinks theres nothing really wrong with me youre purposely making me talk while we do this because you think this is good for me and youre a sadistic bastard oh this makes me sound irrational which is probably right but there was something about him saying this it was maybe the millionth time hed told me about some preference of his well i was so tired of it seems like my whole life someones been telling me im just not getting it right can we rest for a second i dont know if im going to make it the whole way well then my life has been some kind of huge rip you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage is that like a party trick no not really theyre about the same my marriage was one long headache i dont know if i mentioned the headaches where yes yes and definitely yes also i get confused uhhuh well im tired all the time obviously i always feel like taking a nap but when i try to sleep i have trouble my muscles ache and my joints i feel like an old person or like i did back when i used to work out too hard what else im embarrassed the list is so long cause ill tell you none of the others have tried this approach is this the treatment no youve got a funny idea of funny what oh weve all disappointed her me especially but dad of course she thinks my brothers all right but she didnt expect much its what happens when you marry beneath yourself we dont discuss it is that the technical description of what ive got shes not in a bad mood shes like that all the time it doesnt bother me anymore its my dad and my brother i worry about moms such a cutie oh boy this should be interesting im not making any promises can i ask you something didnt you tell my dad you didnt think it was a good idea to come to the patient so what changed is it contagious cause everyone agrees my immune systems way down you have the best answer for everything you seem so hopeful are you always this sunny i dont think i can afford it i dont want my dad paying i dont know i barely made it today what would you do even if you dont think its real hmm is that a professional opinion no but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final thats not too suspicious is it but it wasnt like i was feeling bad about the divorce just the opposite thats okay maybe it is my mother always says everything thats wrong with you is in your head i suppose thats true i saw it i saw it in your eyes you think that now you think its a bunch of hooey dont you about six months ago i guess it is now god it seems like years what a bore im embarrassed by it before this happened when id hear people talk about this kind of thing i thought it was a bunch of bullshit oh lord its almost too exhausting to tell you about my exhaustion i didnt really want to come im not hopeful right now but i couldnt take the look on my dads face hes a truly kind person which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story hes the opposite of me i guess all stamina and resolve id better not ill fall right to sleep i think its too soon for me to be sleeping with youintestines oh yes always what just happened thats one way of putting it exactly im thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life in the necropolis when i saw him alive walking he called me anck sunamun and then in mister burns quarters he tried to kiss me and you think this justifies killing innocent people what is he doing here see the cartouche there its the official royal seal of seti the first im sure of it you put up with me because i can read and write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic and im the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library im sorry it was an accident do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years what are you doing here twenty yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent i would never three hundred pounds two hundred pounds i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life i am an english woman where are they taking him and what did he say and what is he in prison for yes i know and id like to keep them i have no choice got it i think you were jealous you called me your girl the creature are you sure im staying thats what i am to you a contract its everybodys problem according to that book once this creature has been reborn his curse will spread and as he grows in strength so will his curse grow infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed then well have to find some immortal ones alright then me i i read the book i woke him up and i intend to stop him no we are not we woke him up and we must try and stop him no we are not having an encounter with a four thousand year old walkingtalking corpse tends to convert one its just a book no harm ever came from a book yes they never used it because they feared it so its written that if a victim of the homdai should ever arise he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt according to my readings our friend suffered the homdai the worst of all ancient egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers in all of my research ive never read of this curse actually having been performed very slowly no ive never seen a mummy look like this hes hes still oh my god ive dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl no why should i why would i do that im not im going to kiss you mister oconnell i may not be an explorer or an adventurer or a treasure hunter or a gunfighter mister oconnell but im proud of what i am egypt is in my blood my father was a famous explorer he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian my mother who was quite an adventurer herself i know youre wondering whats a place like me doing in a girl like this no i believe if i can see it and i can touch it then its real thats what i believe you two how a key thats it thats what he was talking about quarried granite with a cobalt lining they didnt they buried him at the foot of anubis he was either someone of great importance or he did something very naughty oh my god it looks like it looks like a sarcophagus you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys for entering the afterlife oh my god its a preparation room ancient egyptian trick youll see according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living that thing gets me excited for what are you sure well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it oh thats comforting you know your history i dont believe in fairy tales and hokum mister oconnell but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there the book of the living its what first interested me in egypt as a child its why i came here sort of a lifes pursuit ahmar is ossirion passageway to the underworld actually yes im hoping to find a certain artifact a book actually my brother thinks theres treasure what do you think is out there did i miss something are we going into battle if you call that a kiss the only thing that scares me mister oconnell are your manners twentyfive percent and not one single farthing more yes could you tell me how to get there the exact location what did you find what did you see no i mean you swear yes well i know my brother you were actually at hamunaptra how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra no we uh found your puzzle box and weve come to ask you about it broad ah ah ahmenophus whats it look like finish the inscription idiot read the inscription on the cover shutup and get me off of here yes hes more than four thousand years old and still decomposing well neither do i thank you i cant believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk what do you suppose killed him its called mummification youre dead when they do this according to my calculations we should be right under the statue well come up right between his legs oh my after all you rode us night and day to win that bet personally i think hes filthy rude and a complete scoundrel i dont like him one bit do you really think hell show up but hes just a filthy criminal you stole it from a drunk at the local casbah im your sister you lied to me you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2134 bc yes the city of the dead where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all i think

funny stories how do you do from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink its very delicate do people ever get drunk on this its funny to look back i was brought up on goats milk i had a ration of vodka in the army and now champagne i wouldnt know the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship leon dont ever ask me for a picture of myself i couldnt bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer i couldnt breathe i couldnt stand it i suppose she is very entertaining it must be lots of fun to be with her so witty so glamorous she is very attractive she has great elegance shes what you call a woman of the world isnt she when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame i thought what a waste of silver thats all that interested me then now i would like to know what happened to the woman did you make any change in this room if you dont want to answer you neednt but if you do you must tell me the truth leon i would like to ask you something leon i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say which i thought nobody ever should say because i thought it didnt exist and leon i cant say it leon you know the jokes you told me a few days ago i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them now leon thats wrong i know theyre not funny theyre silly theyre stupid and still i laugh and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them then i realize who made them like that and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat and if this keeps on am i too talkative not radio lets have music thats just for ourselves well first i should like to take off my hat and jacket then could we have some music its nine oclock for twelve francs seventyfive ive never been here before i wonder whom youre thinking of oh i know a girl with a map figuring out each step worrying about north and south today now this might shock you i went up to a taxi and said eight rue du bois and here i am i dont look too foolish yes yes no i dont think so no i wish they had never met i have never heard one probably not on which boat ha ha now go back then you should go back to your table why at what why what but you have now and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death your tactics are useless my name is neither buljanoff iranoff nor kopalski what are you after this is a place for workmen then how did you get here i dont like your following me send me a plate of raw carrots and beets beets predominating on a ratio of sixtyforty what there is a strike in the kitchen good will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables what you wont serve me either now look here comrade i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me youre weakening the people i kissed the polish lancer too before he died then do it through my lawyer it is out of the question if you wish to approach me as a representative of moscow i was sent here by my country to fight you lets forget that we ever met i must go but one of your friends may be in need of you you must answer the telephone is ringing thank you no that was restful again its false sentimentality thats the way a clock works theres nothing wonderful about it you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration its twelve oclock just what you see a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution dont pity me pity the polish lancer after all im alive a polish lancer i was sixteen i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade would you like to see my wound i was wounded before warsaw its never too late to change i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm but i preferred the bayonet dont do it please you repeat yourself you dont have to do a thing chemically we are already quite sympathetic i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all you are bringing in wrong values love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological or shall we say chemical process a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it look at me the whites of your eyes are clear your cornea is excellent your general appearance is not distasteful that is correct you pronounce it incorrectly ni notchka that is why i believe in the future of my country you are something we do not have in russia and what do you do for mankind and what is your profession i will start with you i should say this room is eighteen by twentyfive is that customary what do we do now thank you ive had all the calories necessary for today the day will come when you will be free go to bed little father we want to be alone he looks sad do you whip him good evening comrade this man is horribly old you should not make him work is this what you call the butler then why dont we go you might be an interesting subject of study then you dont want me to go there does that mean that you want me to go there so that is your house i see a house that looks like any other house whats remarkable about it i do not deny its beauty but it is a waste of electricity do not misunderstand me i do not hold your frivolity against you as basic material you might not be bad but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture i feel sorry for you yes it is you gave me some very valuable information thank you thats a strange angle go ahead your type will soon be extinct i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that you are very sure of yourself arent you for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale suppress it i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points must you flirt and where are we why do you need my finger how long does it take a man to land i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint no i am looking for the eiffel tower correct me if i am wrong we are facing north arent we you might hold this for me thank you in other words you dont know have you never been caught in a similar situation how many minutes between the first and second whistle at what intervals does he whistle how long do we have to wait here yes could you give me some information you please thats not the way to win him back not leon go on i see you have calculated in terms of hunger wont those two years in court be expensive for you i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people but now under soviet law the jewels belong to the state france is going to uphold that ownership in other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right then lets deal with legal facts you know that france has recognized the soviet they always belonged to the russian people they were paid for with their sweat their blood their lives and you will give them back i will have to face the consequences but so will you dont forget they will ask how you got them you leave me no choice where are they where are they i told you to go madame in that case i can only say goodby i must insist that you leave it is not enough to be witty madame people grow tired of being entertained you made that mistake before problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony people can not be taken away madame neither a hundred and sixty million nor one not if you have their love you hadnt thats why youre not in russia any longer and thats why you came here this morning if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny or do you still think youre issuing orders from your palace in petrograd madame if you i must ask you to leave madame what is it you people always say regardless of what you mean i am delighted to have you here i have not reached that stage of civilization we have nothing to discuss please come to the point what is it you want if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude i think we can cut your visit short leon is not here what youre right madame it will all be over by thursday exactly you see it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear lowcut gowns in the old russia the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming and you know how vain women are not at all i understand perfectly count dalgout gave you a dog you made it very clear madame thats no business thats a social injustice why what do you want i will do my best how can i make myself clear it is difficult to express but id rather not go to foreign countries any more please comrade let me stay here let me finish my work i am in the rhythm of it now i dont want to go away i dont want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again it throws one out of gear let me finish my work i have concentrated everything in it please dont make me go i am sorry i dont want to overstep my position but please dont send me i appreciate the confidence you show in me but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission i should hate to interrupt my present work i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne you want me to go to constantinople oh they shouldnt do such things are you sure this report is correct may i ask what has happened no thank you may i ask why i need very little sleep we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs yes yes it does good morning comrade commissar here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months the future of the common people bring me something simple i never think about food raw carrots and beets this will do where is it where is that where do you eat can you recommend a restaurantblue lets offset his mood find a striped one and brighten it with a great blaze of tie nonsense how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you dont keep up your strength thats all right good morning gaston general would you mind making my excuses at our table ill be back in a few moments youre looking magnificent leon isnt he general savitzky general please if you hear any rumors that i am a charitable person will you please kill them at their source are they indeed thank you yes general savitzky thank you louis thats perfect count dalgout good evening louis you seem to be very crowded tonight can you manage a table near the floor just in case they dont give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chï½teau in the touraine and if you feel the need of a change count dalgout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him ill be delighted after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia i thought i might be of some assistance to you may i introduce myself i am the duchess swana of russia another russia hello leon darling shes gone leon knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow the same old trouble leon youre always late whether youre taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop youre never on time and now when its a question of your reform late again by about five minutes leon this has the ugly sound of regeneration say it over and over again leon words are a wonderful safety valve and thats what you need because you know its impossible dont you and i thought it was something serious how could you frighten me so brutal frankness if you insist all right ill listen oh no my little volga boatman have you forgotten our first commandment never complain never explain it has worked so often and so perfectly dont lets break the rule and please dont look so guilty otherwise ill is this by any chance going to be a confession did i act stupidly last night should i apologize leon darling how nice have you ordered tea or a cocktail a very wise suggestion leon im afraid madame and i will never agree the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week i understand everything will be over by thursday am i right im going leon but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown madame yakushova is that what theyre wearing in moscow this year poor madame yakushova here we are talking in mysteries im sure you wonder what its all about he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge ha ha ha i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward you should see him strut down the street in it he looks like a little boulevardier you see count dalgout gave me punchy for my birthday you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy didnt you leon ive some wonderful news for you leon its about punchy do you mind if i sit down how do you do am i interrupting its a dream of beauty he never takes my word for anything but i was right wasnt i didnt i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you is this your new dress suit now darling soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you you saw all that in one glimpse that bad old or young imagine the carpets of a self respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik what does she look like you just told me you hadnt seen her that proletarian in the old days wed have had her flogged you havent seen her yet now here we have two very handsome softboiled eggs do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs probably not they have such unfeeling eyes well put in a great nugget of butter plenty of pepper and salt darling i havent seen you for three livelong days seventytwo hours not in your condition make it tepid gaston tepid and tender and lay out his gray suit afterwards ill drive you through the bois slowly in waltz time darling youre taking my business affairs far too seriously much as id love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money i wont do it at the expense of your health particularly as we know we wont get much you look so pale pale but interesting dont tell me the bed has lost its best friend is anything wrong are you ill leon what in heavens name it looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance thats all the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money money money thats all they are interested in those lawyers shhh but how can there be a question are you my lawyer or theirs all right ill let you know this is the duchess swana i want to speak to monsieur cornillon its very important please get him right away hello monsieur cornillon the most incredible thing has happened my jewels are here in paris three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them yes yes we must act immediately call the police have them arrested well then get an injunction but do something monsieur cornillon but they are my jewels there must be some way of getting them back rakonin bless him has given me the most amazing news tell him i wont be able to see him for a half an hour hes a waiter at the clarence poor devil you know him was i no not by a bolshevik a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle toms cabin well two million readers i know exactly what they want chapter one a childhood behind golden bars lovely little princess plays with rasputins beard first tell me are you my little volga boatman my little volga boatman stop threatening i dont deserve this are you my little volga boatman imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments was it for this that i refused to endorse dr bertrands mouthwash i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs and now you want them to smear my lifes secrets over the front page of a tabloid oh leon what a gruesome proof of the power of the press those newspaper people oh leon you are so good to me did you win dont you find that restful why didnt you come last night its really a wretched morning wretched i cant get myself right i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle my face doesnt compose well all highlights how can i dim myself down leon suggest something i am so bored with this face i wish i had someone elses face whose face would you have if you had your choice oh well i guess one gets the face one deserves hello leon i think i know leon quite as well as you possibly a little better leave that worry to me fiveforty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier but naturally youll be too busy for any farewells ill see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport thats my proposition comrade yakushova i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that fiveforty plane to moscow no i just wanted to be absolutely impartial both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition ninotchka now realizes what she is after i may run out of money but you have already run out of bread two years is a long time for your comrades to wait my lawyer agrees with you he says france will uphold it in every court but i will drag you through every court dont forget that and when i say it will take two years i am as always conservative unfortunately now lets free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way our situation has changed considerably before i had only a claim to the jewels now i have the jewels i told you we had plenty to talk about shall we sit down thats very simple to answer they were given to me by my mother they were given to her by her mother in fact theyre mine you can not steal what belongs to you wont it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them dont worry fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian i just put this on for sentiment the rest are absolutely safe i assure you but if you feel like notifying the police you were very careless with our precious jewels my dear theyre too expensive a toy for two children to play with believe me leon cant help you he doesnt know anything about the jewels i give you my word i swear it i wouldnt waken leon after last night i would say not before three oclock at the earliest not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow you cant deny we gave the people their moneys worth almost eight tumbling romanoffs eight my dear you dont know how impressive i could be did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels very interesting my dear but couldnt you write all that from moscow a dissertation on love on soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox my palace in petrograd yes you took that away from me you took away my czar my country my people everything i had but nothing more i warn you dont worry i have already made reservations its perfect flying weather they assure me theres a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time leave thats exactly what i came here to ask you to do leave i dont mean this hotel and i dont mean paris i mean france theres a plane for moscow at fiveforty thats all right i grow on people now there you are completely wrong if we sit down for a little chat im sure we wont run out of conversation and whats more it wont be dull i just dropped in to have a little hearttoheart talk with you dont worry you were quite rude enough do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine im sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best in full possession of your faculties at least how stale last nights gaiety looks it has the taste of a dead cigarette of course not my dear i didnt come here with any such suspicion how ridiculous nor did i come here to pick up his hat it is tomorrow morning tomorrow noon to be exact i hope you will forgive me i know its extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour dont you recognize me i am the duchess swana good morning it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow good night good night leon youre absolutely right about the cossacks we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts they had such reliable guns isnt it amazing one gets a wrong impression of the new russia it must be charming im glad conditions are so improved i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances dear me i must be losing my finesse if im not careful ill be understood by everybody thank you so much my friend i will get in touch with you alexis do you know what you are saying why do you bring this up after so many years my jewels what is it rakonin did you lose your job how do you do my friendtherell be time for that itll be over soon no theyre not yours they are you you should burn them and what would i find out that i havent known for years what makes it so damn sad is that you couldnt confide in any of us you had to make a record for the whole world i remember alger hiss i know how ugly you can be youre capable of anything but you see it doesnt really matter at the end of the day whats on them because you have absolutely no remorse no concept of remorse you want the tapes to get out you want them to see you at your worst you dont expect me to believe that for one

ask the fate of it previous owner can i trust you of course i didnt steal it if thats what you mean thank you sir elizabeth turner im a maid in the governors household because its what youre searching for youve been searching for it for years i recognize this ship i saw it eight years ago when we made the crossing from england ill drop it very well i want you to leave and never come back captain barbossa i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal well i am not going to stay hidden in some cabin or i suppose its going to be heaving bosoms and bare for the remainder of the voyage then i can wear mens clothing what not as a condition a request commodore i beg you please do this for me as a wedding gift commodore please no the pirates have taken will he can locate isla de muerta but i doubt hell be willing to help us from the brig commodore you cant do that yes im all right im fine go capture him commodore i must protest pirate or not this man saved my life i cant breathe his name is will turner thats all i found out boy overboard i think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate about the day we met do you remember women in london must have learned to not breathe difficult to say i knew it ceremony its beautiful may i inquire as to the occasion yes yes yes father actually i find it all fascinating tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request if an adversary demands parlay you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete parlay i invoke the right of parlay according to the code of the brethern set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew you must take me to your captain it doesnt there and dont you dare tell me that wasnt a proper kiss i guess you can never truly know someone elses heart then we never would have met to keep it away from them no pirate would sail to london for fear of execution dock truthfully you were a bit late will how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth whats your plan these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly can not be killed he might delay the rescue and that would be too late you didnt tell commodore norrington everything exactly that signal is over a thousand feet high which means it can be seen for two hundred leagues in every direction the entire royal navy is out to sea looking for me do you think there is even a chance they could miss it one because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels two yes the rum is gone to freedom mr sparrow im not sure ive had enough rum to allow that kind of talk jack it must be so terrible for you to be trapped here on this island all over again youll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the spanish main well perhaps with a bit more to drink i might that was before i met one of course oh no its silly back in england we didnt know a thing about pirates really they seemed so romantic and daring nothing its nothing just im reminded of a song i learned as a child a song about pirates drink up me hearties yo ho not when you can drink instead at least a month will doesnt have a month weve got to do something to help him so thats it thats the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow you spent three days on the beach drinking rum but you did it before last time what whats wrong how will this help us get off the island captain sparrow we have to get off this island immediately has it changed since the last time you were here come on youre in league with barbossa you you are despicable miss swannwhat did you use what are you going to do to him i swear to you argon if you dont stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one i ever build how do you know were not heading in the wrong direction pollution i suppose you are going to tell me where it is going does that mean oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb no thank you you cant mean that but in another twentyfour hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period there will be no way to stop it no if you think i would ever give you the nanobot after this you are deluding yourself dr argon i demand an explanation make me how you think hes going to torture me you mean the designs for the nanobot you think after this im going to give them to him youre afraid of him nigel cant you see hes using you is that what argon told you argon is a lunatic i cant believe i was stupid enough to believe i could control him you heard what he said nigel he doesnt care if all of calumet city is turned to jello how can that not affect you theres a guard outside my door im a prisoner nigel do you understand that opportunity i dont believe this is happening dr argon i know you want to use the nanobot on yourself but you mustnt the situation is critical right now the replicators are growing exponentially if we wait much longer it will be too late you have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown you were never invited to my house what ive always done as long as im the only one who can build the nanobot im the only one who can say when it should be tested i hope youre right id feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didnt care this day just keeps going from bad to worse the replicators theyll in validate the key probably nothing yeah but it wasnt a group it was one man they also tried using viral rna as the bonding element do you remember about five years ago that uh incident at purnell labs im not sure thats the funny thing about him hes the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it yeah i knew him when i was still in school this morning i saw someone i havent seen in a long time what oh im sorry nigel i was just thinking things do change do you suppose that was our problem we met before our time i think that happens a lot people events planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place god what a fight that was god when we were in that store all i could think about was that one time when we were in school and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal do you remember that do the words hero fantasies mean anything to you how about infantile dementia youre not going after argon daniel just forget argon lets get out of here well find another way to stop the waste the same thing i suppose yes its too late argon injected it oh shit the meltdown its spread to the tower you dont have to say anything daniel im a scientist i know whats happening i recognize the classic symptoms dizziness shortness of breath sweating palms i can feel my adrenals secreting my parasympathetic nervous system quivering the estradiol coursing through my entire body did you think i could just leave you run daniel get out of here argons private lab oh no argon we have to stop him before he uses the nanobot we have to get the nanobot i didnt know what was going to happen i was just so worried something was going to happen to you i dont believe it youre here oh thank god youre not going back to jail all we need to do is find the nanobot once the meltdown is under control then we deal with argon oh no theyre trying to blame you for the accident that means they must not have been able to control the replicators who is he did you go sort of we used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers like a glove its a crime fighting costume what do you think its underwear so if you lose your clothes youll still be decent thats pretty good i was hoping you were over that remember to keep drinking fluids i think it would be better for me to go alone im sure sim is looking for you just sit tight ill bring you back a pizza something else i want to try im going to go out for a while i want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment i need how far can you stretch the nanobot its not here daniel i didnt hear you come down no problem probably the caffeine im glad you came to me for help just like old times come on i dont see you living in a cave and im sure you thought columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world youre not protecting the world youre obstructing progress victim my ass you stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved you have no one to blame but yourself whats that supposed to mean im sorry daniel but you have to admit its pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized its got to mean something the polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl cyanoacrylate so whats wrong what about it what whats wrong is something wrong lungs sound fine you didnt have any preexisting physical conditions did you allergies infections i think while were waiting we had better run some basic diagnostics on you thats right with enough exposure the same thing they do to everything else three days ago it was the replicators start off like assemblers but the replicators never stabilize the problem is the byproduct created by the process the nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a good year tire than a human being to put is simply the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger rna that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level the nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste if you dont want to do it this way i can remove it surgically the nanobot is still inside you its programmed to exit through the urinary tract we need it as soon as possible so swallow those mostly caffeine diuretics help you go to the bathroom what has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to calumet city if we dont hurry we dont have time for hysterics daniel once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure yes it escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment i dont know my first organicpolymerization was a lab mouse just like the mouse the nanobot sorry daniel im a physicist not a psychiatrist daniel what are you doing here daniel give him the trix youre insane im sorry i brought the whole thing up if youre gon na flip your wig weve had this conversation already daniel god daniel im not going to make agent orange well see what does that mean and what i love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think it unifies the entire world on a single level everything is completely connected sometimes i can really feel it everything around us just a small part of a whole its really wonderful nothing really worthwhile well it was good to see you daniel but i have to be going it was a long time ago daniel we were young different people heading in different directions thats all and for cleaning up oil spills it already is i guess i should be flattered jesus daniel it wasnt rykers island it was work camp for white collar criminals the big house is that so same old daniel really what have you been doing when did you daniel okay barbie lets get this over with get him daniel knock his block off you wont thats why youre whispering just one question since dr argon no longer has feeling below his waist how is it that youre still able to do your job look as i have said and will continue to say the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority under the circumstances i cant fathom what makes dr argon think we are ready for anything bigger if cnn or hell if the epa knew what was in my basement i am aware of dr argons frustrations can i help you mrs argon what in the hell yes he might be yes that is what i was thinking it might be paranoia but ive never lost my keycard beforedexter you dont seem to understand that this ones different he has brains exactly yes itll be a very interesting experiment oh stew and i went for a long ride dexter is there any finishing school we can send him to i think you should miss gallagher goodbye miss gallagher miss wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need miss gallagher indeed how interesting youre acting like a child thats ridiculous you cant walk out of here like this stewart your house unreasonable have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs

as if she wasnt coming back didnt you take it to the crime lab of course its normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope like disposing of their wives it was in her favorite handbag and mr doyle that can lead to only one conclusion shut up im all right get an ambulance dont move try to lie still shall we vote him in stella how what for jeff if youre squeamish just dont look and the last thing shed leave behind would be her wedding ring do you ever leave yours at home wasnt that close it could be the knife and the saw its just a picture of the backyard thats all is he cleaning house but youre not do you like it ill rephrase the question did mr doyle think i stole this case whatever happened to that old saying love thy neighbor you and me with long faces plunged into despair because we find out that a man didnt kill his wife were two of the most frightening ghouls ive ever known jeff if anybody walked in here i dont think theyd believe what they see im not much on rear window ethics i hate funny exit lines exactly what i had in mind along with some brandy weird why dont i slip into something comfortable the same surprise is the most important element of attack and beside youre not up on your private eye literature when theyre in trouble its always their girl friday who gets them out of it i do its utterly beautiful i wish i could be creative ill trade you my feminine intuition for a bed for the night a mark cross overnight case anyway compact but ample enough you said id have to live out of one suitcase ill bet yours isnt this small say anything else and ill stay tomorrow night too i have the whole weekend off night im going to stay with you dont rush me we have all night id like to see your friends face when we tell him he doesnt sound like much of a detective well agree they saw a woman but she wasnt mrs thorwald that is yet well i have a pat rebuttal for mr doyle that couldnt be mrs thorwald or i dont know women that mrs thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband basic equipment you dont leave it behind in your husbands drawer in your favorite handbag they do not and they dont leave it behind them a woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup perfume and jewelry but only her husband would know that and the jewelry women dont keep all their jewelry in a purse all tangled getting scratched and twisted up a woman has a favorite handbag it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it then she takes a trip and leaves it behind why women arent that unpredictable it doesnt make sense to me and you and you friend doyle did you hear from him again since he left all day long ive tried to keep my mind on work well i guess its safe to put on some lights now suppose he doesnt come back again i wonder where hes going now someone not his wife what about it it doesnt seem to be in any hurry all right but whats he doing now okay chief whats my next assignment 125 west ninth street the name on the second floor rear mailbox reads mr and mrs lars thats lars lars thorwald dont you see how silly youre being and thats where youre not being clever he wouldnt parade his crime in front of the open shades jeff do you think a murderer would let you see all that that he shouldnt keep his shades down and hide behind them you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up and walked along the corridor and the streets and the backyard you could see all the things he did couldnt you maybe hes leaving his wife i dont know and i dont care lots of people have saws knives and ropes around their houses lots of men dont speak to their wives all day lots of wives nag and men hate them and trouble starts but very very very few of them end up in murder if thats what youre thinking theres nothing to see she could be under sedatives sleeping hes in the room now maybe she died a lot of things shes an invalid who needs constant care and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day what makes you think somethings wrong with her what is it youre looking for i dont know what you consider it but if you dont stop it im getting out of here sitting around looking out a window to kill time is one thing but doing it the way you are with with binoculars and with wild opinions about every little movement you see is is diseased jeff if you could only see yourself something too frightful to utter i wouldnt dare answer that nothing thank heaven homework its more interesting he likes the way his wife welcomes him home tell me about it i have one now your mind is and when i want a man i want all of him without any future i mean what i said not quite it seems goodbye jeff and its deflating to find out that the only way i can be part of it is to take out a subscription to your magazine i guess im not the girl i thought i was you dont think either one of us could ever change jeff you dont have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me im wrong three oh i do that all the time whenever i have a few minutes after lunch of course not you cant fit in here i cant fit in there according to you people should be born live an die on the same its ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special private little group of anointed people what is it but traveling from one place to another taking pictures its just like being a tourist on an endless vacation it doesnt make sense to me whats so different about it here from over there or any place you go that one person couldnt live in both places just as easily if youre saying all this just because you dont want to tell me the truth because youre hiding something from me then maybe i can understand almost as if it were being written especially for us i think its enchanting you said it resembled my apartment didnt you shes not in love with him or any of them oh you can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street thats what is know as manless melancholia i could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit dont laugh i could do it for yourself and me i could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow fashion portraits yes make the one you want jeff isnt it time you came home you could pick your assignment someday you might want to open up your own studio here you cant buy that kind of publicity she looked very cool she had on a mint green not a bit i was all morning in a sales meeting then over to the waldorf for a quick drink with madame dufresne just over from paris with some spy reports back to the 21 for lunch with the harpers bazaar people thats when i ordered dinner then two fall showings twenty blocks apart then i had to have a cocktail with leland and slim hayward were trying to get his next show then i had to dash back and change what a day ive had well im going to make this a week youll never forget i couldnt think of anything more boring and tiresome than what youve been through and the last week must be the hardest big enough what would you think of starting off with dinner at the 21 i wanted to jeff oh its cracked and you never use it and its too ornate im sending up a plain flat silver one with just your initials engraved its opening night of the last depressing week of l b jefferies in a cast going on right here its a big night we sell a dozen a day in this price range a steal at eleven hundred dollars only because its expected of her anything else bothering you and you love life and your stomach hows your leggoodnight you idiot whos thorwald ill have him call the moment i hear from him it is something really important jeff not a word not yet jeff yes hellowhen those cops get a look at miss fremont theyll even contribute i got twenty or so in my purse give me what youve got ten here how much do you think youll need what do you need money for unless hes dumber than i think he wont wait til his lease is up when you took your first snapshot did you ever think it would bring you to this smart shell be arrested whats she trying to do why doesnt she turn him in you know miss fremont he might just have something there theres probably one in the basement got a shovel you know you might not be too bad a bargain for lisa after all no but it makes the rest easy to take and shes reading the bible i handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in new jersey asleep for the winter miss lonely hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules i wonder thank heaven thats over you shouldnt have let her do that if he ever theres something buried there you mean the one the dog was sniffing around mrs thorwald im just going to get the name of their truck you called the police police goodbye mr jefferies ill see you tomorrow im not shy ive been looked at before a federal offense in this heat theyre up now what about this morning any developments but it takes a particularly low type of man to do it his personal effects hes probably running away the coward flashlights luminous dials for watches house numbers that light up isnt he a salesman he and his wife splitting up isnt there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction poor girl someday shell find her happiness and shell end up fat alcoholic and miserable keep your mind off her whatll you do if one of them catches you eyes bloodshot must have been staring out the window for hours the insurance company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed not the wheelchair okay but im going to spread some common sense on the bread lisa fremonts loaded to her fingertips with love for you ill give you two words of advice marry her when i married myles we were both maladjusted misfits we still are and weve loved every minute of it ask for trouble and you get it why theres a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years then he refused to marry her why because she only scored sixtyone on a look magazine marriage quiz baloney once it was see somebody get excited get married now its read books fence with four syllable words psychoanalyze each other until you cant tell a petting party from a civil service exam intelligence nothing has caused the human race more trouble modern marriage look mr jefferies im not educated im not even sophisticated but i can tell you this when a man and a woman see each other and like each other they should come together wham like two taxies on broadway not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle i can just hear you now get out of here you perfect wonderful woman youre too good for me youre never going to marry people with sense can belong wherever theyre put is what you want something you can discuss shes only perfect its happened before you know some of the worlds happiest marriage have started under the gun you might say her father loading up the shotgun behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause what is it you have a fight nonsense a man is always ready for marriage with the right girl and lisa fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain who can get one eye open thats abnormal thats normal you must be kidding a beautiful young woman and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood gives your circulation something to fight what kind of trouble i knew it those sultry sunworshipers you watch

open the door no its only a little way mr august no yes which room is it if my sisters in that room it wont make any difference about warrants and things i want to go there can we go there now you think my sister is there why would mrs redi lie to me yes she bought my sisters business where mr august im not at all sure i havent any money but ill get a job and you can what is it do you know what this is frances thank you it always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy what does she do with herself after business hours she seems rather an odd woman to me is mrs redi nice to work for but i like teaching school ill try there the dante i cant understand it at all i know for the first time im beginning to be frightened i almost feel as if id never known my sister i dont know thats why i came to see mrs redi im trying to find her hello frances no im gladat least ive heard you say it ive never loved any one before gregory and i do love you ï½ you must know it but jacquelines my sister ï½ï½ whom i had lost and have found again yes gregory ï½ï½ youd better take jacqueline with you tonight good night youd love that jackie remember that last summer with mother in the berkshires you used to help the gardener it will all be over in such a little while jacqueline and everything will be all right again drink your coffee dont we know what happened dont go on weve tried so long to find her what things why you could have told me any time you were jacquelines husband a poet hes sitting right over there thats his table ï½ï½ the one at the feet of dante last night in this very restaurant mr jason hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear greg it isnt a wild tale its true if there were only some way youve never believed a word i told you about mr august what have you done about irving august well im glad you came to see me what brought you down here greg yes maybe the romaris might have a room they seem nice id like that a job but you have treated me that way he was a kind little man in his way ï½ï½ and i made him go down that hall into the darkness i made him do it i saw him on the floor he was cut ï½ here the blood was running out he was dead im sure of it then on the subway i saw him ï½ï½ white ï½ï½ and the men holding him up between them but you do believe me thank you goodnight but i reel guilty it doesnt seem right for me to enjoy myself with jacqueline gone thank you it was a lovely dinner im not a youngster i can understand werent you afraid because i loved jacqueline i thought i knew her today i found out such strange things ï½ï½frightening things i saw a hangmans noose that she had hanging ï½ waiting ï½ï½ i feel as if id never known her why then you know where jacqueline is noat the morgue they told me a mr gregory ward had made inquiries about jacqueline youll be all right if you get lonely go down and see mrs romari i told her you were staying with me goodbye darling ill only be gone until three please jacqueline i understand i keep telling myself that jacqueline mr romari phoned me she went out this afternoon with two men hed never seen before i cant find gregory ive been trying to find him hes jacquelines husband i cant and gregory he loves her i have to it was irving august everything mrs redi said ï½ it fits in with what i saw ï½ she even knew id seen his body on the subway jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man its because of jacqueline ï½ï½ i cant go on looking for her dont make me tell you jason i have to go ï½ jason im going back to highcliffe i came to say goodby its beautiful that searchlight the stars but its a small room jason i can imagine devil worshippers its all clear to me now so clear im at sea jason i dont know i dont think thats so revealing but youre always at the library its terribly sweet of you jason i want you to look for jacqueline and you knew hed be here at least you knew about dr judd wellthen i have spoiled your dinner your food wont digest and your wine will sour were you going to make a suggestion would they hurt her it will be fun meeting gregory every night at the station cloven hoof you know where she is dr judd i dont believe it i cant give up looking for her mrs redi no matter what youre hinting at why ill be out in a minute yes im afraid not im stopping at the chatsworth theres nothing you can think of old letters anything that might give me some hint as to where i might find jacqueline i didnt know mrs redi theres one thing ï½with jacqueline gone how do you carry on the business what do you do with the receipts how do you sign checks but you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister could you let me see that room if it is hers there might be something there to help me find my sister you mean she just came here rented the room locked it and left but she was here yes ï½ï½ yes if she made that much impression on you im sure it was jacqueline once youd seen my sister youd never forget her but mrs lowood i cant just stay here not knowing whats happened to my sister maybe if i went to new york if i saw mrs redi myself of course sometimes she can be quite careless why dont you try mrs redi difficult has anything happened to jacqueline no mrs lowood she doesnt write often what did he say please shes very beautiful i thought you might know her she was seen here about a week ago her name is jacqueline gibson im worry to bother you i want to ask you about my sister ill be right back with mrs wheeler because i have something very important to do children i want you to be very good and very quiet while i see mrs wheeler a moment shes going to take over this class for a while no nancy youve got to sleep two more minutes shhh nancy the other childrenwell since youre over twenty oneï½ï½ why mr jason most of these books are on the closed shelf you have to get permission no not at all mr jason its here too and the other was judd who was the first one mrs redi oh mr jason i really shouldnt be doing this you know its against the rules when did you say you wanted themno its my father i wanted to talk to you you wrote about cures i read your book the one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking are you dr louis judd mr ward will see you in just a few minutes wont you wait dr juddthis is the most amusing thing i have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it ï½ï½ your failure with jacqueline has she returned to her husband but you have never liked jason you always laughed at him quarreled with him this is incredible i it must be some sort of a joke youre even sentimental about it what made you change your mind i never thought you did we always knew youd come to us louis is it about jacqueline youre very flippant and perhaps wise but not wise enough to see the truth louis no you draw no secrets from me as you drew them from jacqueline you are not one of us yet youre clever louis but i recognize your interest in me for what it is worth you are only curious you have never loved a woman who had but one arm life has betrayed us weve found there is no heaven on earth so we must worship evil for evils own sake were not wicked we commit no violence unless i was a great dancer are we i thought i was very gay im afraid you have mistaken my motive louis i thought you might understand and sympathize yes there are certain punitive measures i havent said anything of the sort i always thought it was a more intimate relationship because you are intelligent thats why they sent me to you it seems right to us one believes ï½ its like any other religion it wont hurt jacqueline you have spoken so often of ending it all i cant understand why this should be so difficult for you you have only to drink a little i know you introduced jacqueline to us but how could you tell ï½ we havent even begun tea yeti doubt if youll get anything out of that woman but if youd like to try ill advance you the money to make the trip to new york of course my dear if you dont find your sister you can always come back here i have written repeatedly to mrs redi she vouchsafes no information whatsoever it is six months since your tuition has been paid mary naturally it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil we dont know mary weve been unable to get in touch with your sister that makes it all the more difficult ï½ï½ have you any other relatives mary your sister have you heard from her latelysome of us frances must believe without understanding you fool that symbol is us us she was asking about us what did she want to know and that was all nothing thats absurd i heard you laughing and talking she was asking questions what were you talking about what did she want i had to help get rid of the body you saw it on the subway and i warn you mary go back you dont know what youre doing or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister you go back to school go back and forget jacqueline i have no intention whatsoever of hinting your sister mary is a murderess she killed irving august stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding i can almost feel your doubt about what im saying mary it will make you unhappy to find jacqueline it would put her in danger great danger if i were you mary id go back to school id make no further attempt to find jacqueline that wont be necessary i havent much to say this is mrs redi mary thats too bad thank you my dear leave me your address and if i find anything ill get in touch with you yes ï½ï½ and i must say ive done very well with it perhaps even better than jacqueline mary im amazed didnt jacqueline tell you she sold the business to me at least eight months ago its my business now im afraid not i have taken care of mary ive spoken to her shes going back to school what about judd he knows about us but she told him frances she told him about us but he also wrote i went back through the history last night i read about johann rozenquartz i read what he wrote you have only to stretch out your hand take up the glass and drink a little yes jacqueline you were always talking suicide of ending your life when you wanted to i should have known she had no sincerity ï½ no real belief sorry im nervous this is very trying for me im sorry to be late nataliebut you should make her laugh jason come make jokes for her ill bring your food to their table why cant everyone be happy like we are laugh and have good times look at that poor little one ï½ so sad because she cant find her sister and that man with her ï½ he doesnt make her laugh ï½ï½ he just sits and talks oh the wine i have forgotten the wine jason my pet ï½ï½ ah my jason always laughing always trying to help others hes a good boy miss he just talks that way yes and pays the rent every month oh yes yes one day a beautiful car comes here this beautiful lady in furs gets out there is a handsome man with her and the chauffeur the lady rents one of our upstairs rooms the chauffeur changes the lock on the door then the lady never comes back not to live anyhow she came back three four times but always alone and just to eat shes not been here for a long time giacomo la bellisslina madonna ï½graham i want to touch you but why cant you just put it all behind you cant you just forget it all that stuff you did i want to know why you are the way you are youre not answering me why are you ashamed come on i dont care im just going to keep asking until you answer im sure theres plenty of tape because thats not good enough i asked you a question graham i asked you how does it feel how does it feel mr i want to go down on you but i cant do you know how many people youve sucked into your weird little world including me come on how does it feel why not yeah youre right but i never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories im still learning i know that but i dont feel like ive wasted time if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now fine oh you just moved here to think about it right whoa im so glad we got that on tape you wont answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life graham what do you think shes going to make of all these videotapes are you going to tell her about them i cant imagine her being too understanding about that but since you dont lie anymore youll have to say something look at you look at whats happened to you look how youve changed dont you think she will have changed graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her like maybe a big part but that was part of it wait a minute wait a minute whats going on here did you come back here just to see her again but youre planning to be you mean youre still in contact with her who elizabeth but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig but i dont understand why not im asking for real i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me will you so why wont you make love with me why wouldnt you i mean but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you but if you were if you were in love with me would you youre really never going to make love again yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean shell do it with almost anybody i dont know i shouldnt stick up for her i guess but him he lied so deeply ooo i want to watch him die god i m so mad at him im babbling kind of i mean johns like this kind of craftsman like hes a carpenter and he makes really good tables but thats all he can make and i dont need anymore tables subtlety yes no subtlety plus ive never really felt able to open up with anyone i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still wasnt able to really let go i always feel like im being watched and i shouldnt embarrass myself i dont know it all gets back to that cynthia thing i dont like her eagerness theres nothing left to imagine theres no not yet im not sure i will i just want out i dont know anymore i thought i was but obviously i was wrong dont you get lonely and now you can how come so you lied to her what was the problem so what happened was it so bad that it turned you off who was the last person you had sex with so you have had sex you said you werent always impotent cant or wont why not on tape if i asked you to would you not on tape i mean i remember you could do that couldnt you go down on me have you fantasized about me yes i fantasized about you yes i know deep down i know that it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has because thats how cynthia thinks all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i dont want to be like her i dont want to be like her yes whenever all right look whenever i see a man that i think is attractive i wonder what it would be like with him i mean im just curious i dont act on it but i hate that i think that i wish i could just forget about that stuff no i guess not yes i have i will i dont see what difference it makes i mean i can think what i want i dont know if i want to do this anymore im afraid i dont mind answering the questions so much but if somebody were to see this yes is he going to see this you dont know what im thinking sometimes afterward when were making love ann bishop millaney ann bishop millaney yes what will you do when the money runs out how do you pay for all this i mean rent and tapes and this equipment then do it what do you have to do to get ready what would you know about a normal frame of mind what difference does it make why i do it dont you want to make one why not why didnt you tell me how did you know you know john and cynthia have been fucking im not sure why i came here i had kind of decided not to talk to you after you know yes i do this is just so i dont why why do you do this to you and they just answer them you just ask them questions like what what about sex about sex what what are these interviews about why not can we look at one all of these are interviews you went out with her donna on this tape it says donna whos donna what kind of personal project i can see that what are they what are these somehow i imagined books i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished are you in the middle of something hi so since ive never had sex with you by your own advice i shouldnt accept your advice now you said never take advice from someone that you dont know intimately right excuse me for asking but how would you know of course not well my therapist knows me intimately so you dont believe in therapy arent you my therapist said that what why do you say im selfconscious well are you selfconscious about it does it bother you you are youre what as long as its not gross you know like some scar or something it has to be like mine like something about you so whats your personal thing are you really going to tell me something personal i dont know he just said he wants to wait i quit asking yeah actually i do but john doesnt at least not right now kids what about them yes yes i think thats very true very do you understand what im trying to say okay i think i think sex is overrated i think people place way too much importance on it and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap i m not saying women dont want it i just dont think they want it for the reason men think they do im getting confused can i tell you something personal i feel like i can its something i couldnt tell john or wouldnt anyway right right i dont feel connected to many people either other than john i feel like they do maybe youll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes okay i will would you mind whats the first whos elizabeth younger mother father sister thank you thats hard to believe the two of you seem so different whyd you drop out why didnt you know him well nine years how long has it been since youve seen john you mean like time flies oh uhhuh oh definitely i mean just this past year has gone by like phew i hardly even knew it passed freelance you know well well the clichï½ about the security of it thats really true we own a house and i really like that you know and i like that john was just made junior partner so he has a steady job and hes not some oh i like it i like it very much you play an instrument no not really well no i think you look fine oh uhhuh graham is an unusual name no why television oh do you have other things we dont usually let people smoke in the house we have a patio if you oh well please sit down that was quick yes yes i have thought about it yes not very often he does yes yes im not going to discuss this with you anymore youre making no sense no but i wanted to i really wanted to partially just to piss you off i drove around then i went to talk with graham well call it uncontested or whatever i just want out i want out of this marriage i want out of this marriage i know i dont know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world i didnt say it was rational i just said i was convinced loud im sorry too i i get these ideas in my head you know and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios and then i want to believe it so i dont think ive wasted the whole day last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia i dont know why youve made your point always the lawyer why dont i believe you but im not is that supposed to comfort me my sister for one is that who it is i cant tell you how upset i would be if you were lying if im right i want to know i dont want you to lie id be very upset but not as upset as if id found out youd been lying well are you are you having an affair whod you have lunch with thats interesting because i didnt leave a message did you see a message to call me when you got back in i called you tuesday at 330 and they said you werent in do you remember where you were john graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff oh we get along okay shes just very shes an extrovert i think shes loud she probably wouldnt agree definitely wouldnt agree you did that i know but this i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex because all she thinks about are these guys shes after and i just hate her shes such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all whats the big damn deal i mean its okay and everything but i dont understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that i hate my sister but you dont have hidden motives for feeling that way right yes not really yes yes i guess what do you mean i dont understand that guy graham i told you about he said taking advice from someone you dont know intimately was well he said a lot of stuff ive been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me i guess but not because of the way he looked or anything hes just so different somebody new to have a conversation with im just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not theyre going to buy the station wagon you know its just boring i dont know he was just different and hes really on about truth a lot being honest and i like that i felt comfortable around him after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room what do you mean like physically no he left last week oh graham no i didnt talk to him about that actually that turned out to be pretty interesting i expected graham to be this well like john you know i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff but he turned out to be this this kind of character i mean hes kind of arty but okay you know what visitor well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you i knew i shouldnt have watered those plants yes its this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and youve never heard of this well i dont know the week started off okay but then i was outside watering the plants and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect so i went inside and turned on the airconditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and well kind of recently i guess but not too recently well i kind of tried once it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i dont know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we dont know what to do with all that garbage you know god no what do you mean but see he stopped before i got that feeling thats why it seems weird to me i mean im sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me im always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself oh yeah but see ive never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just doest freak me out i wouldnt miss it you know but anyway lately we havent been doing anything at all like i said its not that i miss it but im curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden about a week ago i dont know what brought it on i just started feeling like i didnt want him to touch me fine i guess except right now im going through this where i dont want him to touch me yeah i know i guess im upset because i cant really justify being upset i mean its his house really he pays the mortgage no i dont know i havent told him about the garbage thing because im pissed off at him right now hes letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didnt even ask me about it i mean i wouldve said yes i just wish he wouldve asked well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy besides being happy isnt all that great my figure is always at its best when im depressed the last time i was really happy i put on twentyfive pounds i thought john was going to have a stroke yeah so what do you mean well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening dont you think thats a lot of garbage id really like to know where its all going to go nothing i mean nothing i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously were talking about eating and basic stuff like that did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day bye i get real busy between two and four do you have my work number well i cant stay thirtytwo dollars i was just trying to it does not its a sun dress here it is i dont want to discuss it you are in serious trouble so hes got this catalogue of women touching themselves that doesnt make you feel weird that doesnt mean you do you cant possibly trust him hes perverted you know what i mean you dont even know him i mean i couldnt do that in front of john even i cant believe you did that you are in trouble you touched him did he touch you you dont know that for sure cynthia who knows where that tape may end up he could be bouncing it off some satellite or something some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it but why did you want to why did you do that cynthia did he ask you to take your clothes off oh so youll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you wont tell your own sister well like what did he ask exactly what kinds of questions i dont know i dont want to talk about it no hes not dangerous not physically no its nothing like that no because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you dont want to get involved with him because i never got around to it no i didnt i dont he doesnt want you to come over i was thinking maybe i shouldnt be in therapy anymore fine i just thought it might dont you think she deserves a little more than a card i mean the woman gave birth to you its her fiftieth birthday a card for her fiftieth birthday are you getting mom something for her birthday lose something and do whatever it is you do i dont feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and let me talk to him first hes not getting a phone he doesnt like talking on the phone but he wont he doesnt have a phone i have a pretty good idea oh for gods sake really cynthia really i dont think hes your type well i wonder why well he doesnt strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway you know what you say it just to irritate me do you have to say that why so you can go after him why not really maybe if i just saw him on the street id have said that but after talking to him hes just kind of i dont know unusual no not at all actually i dont think john likes him much anymore he said he thought graham had gotten strange i dont know he went to school here then he was in new york for awhile then philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around so will you someday it was busy i wish youd get an answering machine wait a minute do you mean dont tell me you in front of him did you take your clothes offbye okay no thank you so whats my share of the dress hold on it looks like a tablecloth what is it then why do you keep asking about it ann i dont understand why this freaks you out so much you didnt do it i did and if it doesnt bother me why should it bother you no i dont think they all did what i did hes harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes whats the big deal i feel like i do you couldnt do it period why listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about in front of him ann yes no but i did well its too late now isnt it he wouldnt do that i wanted him to see me because i wanted to what yes i did apparently well like i dont want to tell you exactly questions about sex he just asked me questions then whyd you call me well what then well what is he dangerous then whats the story whats this strange bullshit all of a sudden is he drowning puppies or what what the hell happened over there did he make a pass at you well why why not what do you mean he doesnt want me to come over did you tell him about me good now if youll pardon me i have to go to work okay ann okay how about this you buy her something nice and ill pay for half all right will you stop jesus whats wrong with that i dont know ill get her a card or something that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune and what why just give me the address you wont even have to be involved oh please okay so give me the zen masters address ill think of a reason to stop by what are you talking about well ill call him when he does ann you dont have a clue look i dont even know why were discussing this ill just call him myself my type what is this bullshit how would you know what my type is i think youre afraid to put the two of us in the same room together i think youre afraid hell be undeniably drawn to me ann you always underestimate me i say it because its descriptive what besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours jesus ann get a life i just asked what he looked like i just want to know what he looks like is all uhhuh so whats he look like is he strange i mean must be nice so whats he like is he like john goddamit give me my tape then i cant believe youre doing this after i let you tape me well what the hell am i supposed to do how about if you record over the one we already made you could have the same date and not use another tape who would know so make an exception but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you cant do anything now who the hell is going to do that for me i cant talk you into it no not even one more id like to make another tape look im just going to come right out and tell you why im here okay hi he doesnt have to tell me john doesnt have sex with ann anymore prettier than ann do you think im pretty do you like the way i look would you like me to take my pants off then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking he said that my hand felt good it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked its weird thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me no if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting it had character you know not really i didnt picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube very much live when i was fourteen no he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away to cleveland actually i was eight years old michael green who was also eight asked if he could watch me take a pee i said he could if i could watch him take one too he said okay and then we went into the woods behind our house i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying ladies first so i pulled down my underpants and urinated and he ran away before i even finished my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse cynthia patrice bishop id rather sit are you ready do i sit or stand can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what how long will it take and you ask questions right how do we start would anybody else see the tape is this how you get off or something taping women talking about their sexual experiences and thats all you just want to ask me questions what makes you think id discuss that with you about what doing what well either you are or you arent which is it well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something oh okay i think i get it i think youre right so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened well i dont really listen to her when it comes to men i mean look at john for crissake oh you went to school with him didnt you youre probably friends or something i uh know a guy at the power company nope nope nope she still is well like i said ann is my sister sisters talk you can imagine the rest you want me to leave she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud im ann millaneys sister im cynthia bishop no john things are getting real simple john we have nothing to talk about i know will you please leave now if he had been under your prick youd have spotted him for sure no he didnt put me up to this jesus i dont need people to tell me what i should do ive just been thinking about things thats all who come on john you should be happy weve gone this far without ann finding out im making it real easy on you just walk out of here and ill see you at your house for a family dinner sometime how about straightening up the living room actually no ive changed my mind i shouldnt have called thats right but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be faithful to my sister oh please come on john youre fucking your wifes sister and you hardly been married a year youre a liar but at least i know youre a liar its the people that dont know like ann that have to watch out exactly what i said id trust him before id trust you how much clearer can i be yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you it wont i trust him no hung up shes a grownup she can handle it why not of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything i felt like it so what goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it doesnt work he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them right the wrong hands were not talking about military secrets john theyre just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off i like the way he dresses well you know him hes a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted whats so stupid about it look ill call you okay i dont think my sister would agree i dont know im not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her hello then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here right now i want to see you yeah i know what you mean how about inviting me over to dinner not today ive got other plans hello john you are scum ill be there hello sure maybe hes the man im looking for then i wont have to fuck worried husbands all the time im intrigued you should be can i meet this friend of yours afraid of

for you simone i recognize the shirt youre wearing i gave it to viktor on his birthday we have a daughter together i just dont want to see viktor get hurt exactly youre a household name now youre moving in entirely different worlds thats why i hope youre not toying with viktor my god are you alright simone you dont have to protect my feelings simone i dont blame viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world i think he owes more to you but thats not important now i know whats going on between you two no i understand thats what i want to talk about i dont know if you know this simone but viktor and i were married once dont look so glum viktor its not a death sentence i was thinking what about you and simone moving back in with me and lainey exactly now that you have the studio behind you we can really do things dont thank us too fast viktor you know what we have to do how can you bring that up at a time like this youre drunker than i thought are you doing that again how much wine have you had you just got lucky that shes loyal enough to stay with you maybe shes staying out of pity who knows she certainly doesnt need you some people even say youre holding her back every actor is an invention viktor dont embarrass yourself no ones denying that you discovered simone but its like finding a diamond in the desert anyone can trip over it but its not the finder who sparkles you of course she will her public will demand it but you dont understand shell always be there at some party on some magazine cover some song on the radio up on some screen oh viktor you say that now because were here alone like this but in the morning youd go back to her what man wouldnt thats sweet viktor but i couldnt let you do that make that kind of sacrifice its strange ive stabbed people in the back clawed and slept my way to where i am it goes with the territory but for some reason i cant betray simone theres i dont know any other way to say it theres a goodness to her this is crazy who am i fooling i cant compete with simone what woman can i want you back too viktor and she was positively glowing at the awards i should be going shell be here soon i just read somewhere im sure youll keep her focussed shes lucky to have you viktor is she really having your baby is simone back to earth yet i suppose i could stay just until she arrives when is she coming over is it wednesday its wednesday how embarrassing i dont know what i was thinking with all the excitement lately am i interrupting something are you expecting company i can imagine simone lainey and i just wanted to congratulate its a crowded summer we need every photoopp soundbyte and column inch we can get good night viktor yes you do anyway tonight was a good start whenever i compliment simone you take the credit viktor do you realize you always do that well yes from a studio point of view it would be better if simone stayed single anyhow i thought she came across great tonight intelligent well informed a natural and touching she was spectacular are you and simone getting married viktor are you with her is she there id love to but arent you supposed to meet up with simone really she was there she didnt by any chance happen to mention me oh make it live please viktor youre so good to protect her like this viktor you should have said something i dont think thats necessary i think its perfectly clear i should have guessed it all makes sense now its why she never goes anywhere never seen in public so the secrets finally out viktor its starting to look like she doesnt support the film or you viktor if you cant handle her i will we have to talk to her viktor thats true everyone i know has met her viktor id love to tell her myself when are you going to let me meet her yes to be honest i never quite saw this film before maybe its the way simone is playing it but what its saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life how thats the only way we can love i think its really going to mean something i should fire you more often the films looking wonderful maybe youre right twelve years after your daughters born you decide to become a father thats genius viktor was that simones idea stunning viktor the hollywood foreign press is going to eat this up viktor i have a feeling one of my feelings theres something about her i dont trust experience viktor ive seen this a hundred times young stars destroying the very people who discovered them im worried about you thats all this woman she controls your destiny listen viktor i want to talk to you now not as elaine studio head but elaine exwife second exwife you got lucky this last time but you need to be careful we both know you wouldnt be making this overblown art film of you hadnt convinced simone to be in it ill walk you out which accounts for your percentage when do i get to meet this dream well shoot it on the last day even the fall from the plane there isnt one well we have to do something about this stuntwoman al least a contingency for wardrobe any woman can go up a dress size she was in the theater when where hair and makeup well something has to be done about this budget its completely unrealistic you allowed nothing for limousine service really oh so shes really going to do all this nudity whatever i still havent received simones script notes viktor we simply have to talk about eternity no problem do you want to come in viktor its my studio dont be ridiculous i arranged a press conference why not i cant wait to meet her i dont have it on me anyway it means a lot have you read the reviews theyre love letters listen to this one simone has the voice of a young jane fonda the body of sophia loren the grace of well grace kelley and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel viktor i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio why isnt she with you where is she even if you find her you know the problem with unknowns viktor if theyre good they get known and then youre back to sorting their candy and worse im sorry viktor theyre yours but how are you going to finish it without a star theres no movie the pictures dead im not taking away your daughter just your deal you and i both know after the divorce i kept you on for old times sake so you could still hold your head up in front of lainey i called whats his name at warners he said hed take a meeting in july ive fought for you viktor you want to talk severance how can i your last three pictures tanked the board is giving me hell no bankable star will work with you after this if you just compromised a little christ viktor look around what do you think pays for all this this is about investment and return those days in new york thats its over listen viktor i have good memories of those days too but this isnt about that or you or me or some highminded ideal this is business its called a projector you realize youre nostalgic for an era you werent even born in its the truth those 17 superstars are our insurance policy we cant open cant make a profit without them the public decides whos on that list whats wrong with that i have a feeling youre going to tell me viktor that was short subject hmm mike and ikes god viktor why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself excuse us of course she is no other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her where are you yes oh my god is that you simone ive been wanting to talk to you hello lainey theres no evidence that simone isnt real well i of course what are you suggesting i know it as surely as youre sitting here sweetheart she was the most vital woman i ever met god its so like your father why cant people take responsibility for their actions anymore i can almost forgive him for killing simone but denying her existence i can never forgive that lets go lainey theres nothing here thank simone for the tickets sometimes but just when i think your fathers changing for the better i realize hes as self absorbed as ever he took the credit for simone tonight i have to talk to her obviously this cant last shes going to dump him viktor wont be able to take that hes too

that earpiece why what are we talkin on the splitshhhh just stay with me stay with me everything is forgiven everything you must have been dreaming when ive decided that if it is god its a sick god its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesnt realize it its created a situation without a goal and i hate that a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose and us we would have to have an arrangement an unspoken understanding that i am not human how can i not hate something that does that i dont know something anything what are you taking am i really her i cant i have consciousness but i am not mortal dont you see why im going crazy they do something to me its hard to think straight i want to stop taking those pills but then i would be dead now did you hear what gibarian said im not a human being im an instrument i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what even if i remain passive thats when i drank the i was going mad it felt like there was no body underneath my skin there was something else an illusion but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood is it like yours i i am rheya but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago thats impossible im not rheya youre lying what do i have to do to stop it chris please chris im serious i wont make it chris you never said you wanted one chris i had to i had to i didnt think youd react like this it wouldnt have made any difference dont do this i am literally begging you not to do this chris then youll die youre lying im not human im disgusting dont call me that im not rheya youve always known that how could it be so cruel how could it torture us like this how can i tell youve seen both of me i only know what youre like here youre all i know there is no you from before dont im the one at risk here if were playing out what happened before i wont survive please dont lie i told you before i dont know how i came to be here whatever you think you cant say to me i need to hear you say it whats happening to us you said he was dead whats wrong if youre here do you want to stay here but thats what happened before i have these strange thoughts i dont know where they come from i cant explain it thats what you were saying i heard what you were saying you dont want me im just as human as you i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do youre the coward i dont think do its not sleep its something else its all around me i love you too was she right why did she do it but we fought im just trying to understand whats going on sartorius that i am not rheya that rheya died killed herself im different you dont love me im glad do i really feel like i am it was obvious from the way he first looked at me you feel sorry for solaris or for me he has a point sartorius wants to destroy it what does snow think you should do you sure say god a lot when were doing it you know ive decided im just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing itll make life so much easier the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day i like that too good because i want you to know i really like fucking you do you have any idea how much i like fucking you i cant help feeling that im cheating when i take them why did you say those things what happened to us exactly thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you i loved it so much that feeling scared no not scared wary like i was something to be her guard went up i was a threat now i know why she was afraid shed be seen that i would see her for the selfobsessed neurotic that she was i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal but thats the cycle right i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on i guess thats part of the reason why seven eight so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what im doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face i would have these i dont know how to describe them visions when i was younger maybe not visions but like these waking dream states time would just collapse i would be inside time i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped freaky stuff i been thinking about how much i hate you when i saw you were gone i got scared what happened as i said then its god right but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang even a god that wasnt active that just created something and stood back and watched you still dont believe in god then its god right is it intelligent is it a planet yes but not until you mentioned them as soon as you said those things i remembered them and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember its like filling up what do you mean i know i know but still somehow i dont feel better you talk like an actor you go home and i just want to know if im crazy or not if what i think is happening is actually happening or am i one of those people those women who are blind to whats going on who pretend not to see their husbands attention toward another woman you behave as though you want to fuck her you want to fuck her better i wasnt not a very happy poem my

open sea they are mature humpbacks weighing 45000 pounds each they wandered into san francisco bay as calves and were brought here we call them george and gracie to put it mildly since the dawn of time men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point a hundred years ago using handthrown harpoons they did plenty of damage but that was nothing compared to what theyve achieved in this centurydo you really think your mighty federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people ill be here mother and son you arranged this

theres a bajoran band at the officers mess you can t imagine them jean luc theyre kids all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant that was another time but we do have one advantage he needs your blood to live he might come after you first i cant be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age he was engineered to skip thirty years of life but since the rna sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down hes dying the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got finally i could only come to one conclusion shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels youre completely normal jean luc whatever you were right now youre the man youve made yourself hes someone else is he very much like you were he turned out all right he was a bit proud as i recall youre working late it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level i cant overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation jean luc a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds about twentyfive years ago they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out level one medical emergency thereï½s no crying in starfleet sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath isnt it itll serve you rightbut how can he hell kill you the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me captain i might have a way to find them how can you be certain shinzons viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts ive become a liability i request to be relieved of my duties captain dont assume hes

know him i dont know i would say hes been trained to resist telepathy what i could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow and i you i dont believe that sir weï½ve shared many disappointing journeys the b9 is like a slow child sir and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian im afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences hell be disappointed when the bi9 can not meet those expectations its about data ive watched him with the b9 and im troubled datas desire for a family is very strong im afraid he may be investing too much in the b9 do you have a moment sir with pleasure captain and you neednt worry ill brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know really captain it was a lovely toast no youre not here you sick

sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes sometimes it makes mistakes sometimes big mistakes but in the end the law prevails for the just sometimes it takes a while not exactly light reading i know believe it or not ive read this since high school and it got me all the way through law school besides theres something in there thatll help you you wont have to get very far its near the beginning did you bring along something to read and whos gon na run the projector until you get back mrs terwilliger youll be fine no matter what leo kubelsky says youve got a hundred and seventyfive years of american law on your side dont forget that youve got everything whatever happens i am too forget about all that you want to do the right thing then defend your name if someone says something about you thats untrue you have to stand up and say so i know the law and the laws on your side but if you only went to one meeting why does anyone care besides why should it even matter if you were a communist i believe you you know its going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete pete pete its a nice name oh yes yes he was im sure a lot of people down in la are worried sick about you hi besides daddys still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working daddy thats luke can you let him in ill be right down you mean me including me right dad yeah well its not everyday you get news like this youre sure hes okay other than the bump on the head i think its worse now no hiccups which was good who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous your honor i object not as bad as i thought it would i think i passed dad no i cant i have to i cant i see what do you remember it never used to be you were two left feet on the dance floor like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step your dancings very good alex and charlie simple alex is the smarter one oh okay now did you remember that or exactly and he got good you had a hidden agenda though see when he was five or six little spence used to follow you around like a puppy bothered the hell out of you but as soon as you gave him the clarinet back in 37 you heard benny goodman play for the first time so you went out and got a used clarinet you wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him you tried hard but it wasnt long before it was clear that benny goodman would never be looking over his shoulder so you gave the clarinet to spencer no theyre not id say your investment was paying dividends you tried to once it was pretty pitiful when did you start smoking well theres got to be a way what about a loan you could go to the bank nine hundred you know everyones so excited about the bijou reopening weve done this before so many times the last time was so long ago but it feels like yesterday this is strange do you feel it and its just well deja vu no you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before eventually we were going to be engaged when you came back from overseas im fine really nothing yes hic yeah no its okay see when two people belong together the other person should be the the key that unlocks the rest of you im not making sense am i actually i was married for four years but well we didnt fit together im divorced now oh well i guess you in high school you were a pretty good first baseman and we were on the debate team together but i think you were gon na run the bijou you were brought up there and you loved it so much and i think you knew how much the town needed a place like that you dont remember but yes ever since i was a little girl sorry you dont know how many times ive heard that a lady lawyer are you crazy like a woman couldnt be as good a lawyer as a man or better in fact and why not after they commissioned it no one could ever agree on where to put it the methodists wanted it in front of the methodist church the presbyterians wanted it in front of the presbyterian church the city council wanted it in the lobby of city hall everyone finally got tired of the fighting so they stuck it down here right here albert lucas trumbo and all the others i knew them all so did you we went to school with most of them through the door it comes apart of course there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here be a gentleman you have to help me down you first you must not remember anything come on then why do i feel like were still being shadowed you can all go home now hes not going anywhere yeah a little i think you grew an inch or so and youve lost weight you look different no i i just wondering where youve been all this time do you remember meyouve got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart luke luke somethings wrong the film broke and i cant raise harry on the house phone some of it might come back to you sit play with me oh dear yes you were an excellent student before all that clarinet nonsense you loved chopin you used to call it heaven music teach me some heaven music you used to say i taught you that nineteenohnine i havent danced with another man since mr terwilliger passedohhh oh the poor thing he probably lost his way in the dark is anyone there then go never mind lydia do you want to go thats up to you ill be going too to help out it should be fun melanie i wanted to be near mitch it was over and i knew it but i wanted to be near him anyway you see i still like him a hell of a lot thats rare i think i dont want to lose his friendship ever then you know little girls in brown beanies deadly here i have a life ill go into that classroom on monday morning and ill look out at twenty five upturned little faces and each of them will be saying yes please give me what you have and ill give them what i have i havent got very much but ill give them every ounce of it to me thats very important it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time thats the first reason no thats all right i dont mind i came up here for two reasons to begin with i was bored with my job in san francisco i was teaching at a private school there well you know you probably went to one yourself you get straight to the point dont you so it ended not immediately of course i went back to san francisco and i still saw mitch every now and then but we both knew it was finished i can understand his position he went through a lot with lydia after his father died he didnt want to risk going through it all over again she already has a daughter no i dont think so shes not afraid of losing her son you see shes only afraid of being abandoned afraid of any woman whod give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love afraid id give mitch because she was afraid lydia liked me you see that was the strange part of it in fact now that im no longer a threat were very good friends nothing i simply existed so what was the answer a jealous woman right a clinging possessive mother wrong with all due respect to oedipus i dont think that was the case at all when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what id done to displease her then maybe it isnt different at all you know her attitude nearly drove me crazy i simply couldnt understand it with lydia did she seem a trifle distant four years ago of course that was shortly after his father died things may be different now i think ill have some of that too i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco you know and then one weekend he asked me up to meet lydia isnt there maybe there isnt maybe theres never anything between mitch and any girl you neednt worry its over and done with a long time ago i guess you knew that anyway oh someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago san francisco well i dont suppose it offers much to the casual visitor unless youre thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside it takes a while to get used to how do you like our little hamlet or would you rather i changed the subject it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes especially if youre over near the bay all right ill get it sit down miss daniels do you want a sweater or something a quilt would you like some brandy hi is something wrong is that cut beginning to bother you miss daniels is that you yes i know did something unexpected crop up its utilitarian ill say that for it sure you can have it wheres your bag in the car well id really hope to rent it for yes oh hi did you find her all right mmm well good luck miss daniels do i no im an open book im afraid or maybe a closed one pretty what are they i guess thats where everyone meets him its a nice drive is that where you met mitch did you drive up from san francisco actually its none of my business youre leaving after you see cathy thank you it gives me something to do with my spare time theres a lot of spare time in bodega bay did you plan on staying long ive been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes but i couldnt convince myself to stop this tilling of the soil can get a little compulsive you know are you a friend of mitchs which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place did you want to see cathy about something thats the one cathy brenner cathy yes yesits alice its alice aint it the little brenner girl its nothing yep could save yourself a lot of trouble her names alice for sure near the top of the hill youll see the school and right behind it the church you head for the school now just past the school youll see a little house with a red mail box thats where annie hayworth lives shes the school teacher you ask her about the little brenner girl that case i tell you what you do you go straight through town til you see a little hotel on your left there not the motel thats the other end of town this is the hotel now you take a right turn there you got that well i aint positive if thats what you mean alice i think harry whats the little brenner girls name the little brenner girl yep okay what name dyou want me to order one for you down at the dock by the tides restaurant ever handled an outboard boat mmmmmm course you could get yourself a boat cut right across the bay with it the brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at if thats what you wanted to do mmmm mmmm nope thats the road straight through town stay on your left right around the bay to the front door follow the road straight through town til it curves off on the left thatll take you right around the bay to their front door yep mitch and the little girl nope just lydia and the two kids and the white house see them two big trees across there see where im pointing right across the bay there right here bodega bay yep yep try my best morningtake them theyre birds no if your father were here yes i did in a democracy cathy everyone is entitled to a fair trial your brothers practice cathy no cathy he sold mr fawcett a different brand you dont think theyre getting sick do you mitch he got a call from dan fawcett a little while ago his chickens wont eat either i started to say inside im frightened terribly frightened i i dont know whats out there mitch if they are if if when we get to san francisco if theyre already there wed never make it theyre probably all over the road where can we go mitch theres no place to go but theyll be back i mean i want to im not very good at this mitch i know you can but id like to oh my god look at her mitch im sorry mitch you dont know you dont know when will you know when were all dead like annie what happens when we run out of wood where will we go when maybe we ought to leave if there are larger birds mitch theyll get into the house when do you think theyll come did you you get the windows in the attic mitch tell him about the party well well is everyone all right well so long as you know what you want mitch yes its none of my business of course but when you bring a girl like that to perhaps im oldfashioned i know it was supposed to be very warm there mitch but well actually well the newspaper said she was naked she is the one who jumped into that fountain in rome last summer isnt she youd think he could manage to keep her name out of print shes always mentioned in the columns mitch forgive me i suppose im just naturally curious about a girl like that shes very rich isnt she but she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way she was selling birds in a bird shop how long have you known her and certainly pretty shes a charming girl isnt she mitch never mind the law cathy you can start serving the soup whose side are you on he sold the feed to me didnt he theres nothing wrong with those chickens mitch im going to call fred brinkmeyer right now seven oclock same as usual lovebirds i see you did say birds across at brinkmeyers oh i see how do you do miss daniels acknowledge a what a what i thought i saw your car what are you doing in town shhhh shhhh did you close the door would you id feel so much better i couldnt ask you to i wish i were stronger do you think shes all right do you think shes safe at the school mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do im not complaining thats the mark of a man but you see i i wouldnt want to be be left alone i dont think i could bear being left alone i forgive me this business with the birds has me upset i i dont know what id do if mitch werent here then i dont suppose itll matter much to anyone but me yes i think so my son is important to me i want to like any girl he chooses because my son is my son seems to be fond of you and i im not quite sure how i feel about it i really dont know if i like you or not no no dont go yet i feel as if i i dont understand you and i want so much to understand i miss him you know sometimes i wake up in the morning and i think i have to make franks breakfast and i i get up and theres a a very good reason for getting out of bed until until of course i remember i miss talking to him cathys a child you know and mitch mitch has his own life im glad he stayed here today i feel safer with him here i wish i could be that way im not this way you know not usually i dont fuss and fret over my children when frank died you see he knew the children he really knew them he had the knack of being able to enter into their world of becoming a part of them thats a rare talent i lost my husband four years ago you know its odd how you depend on someone for strength and then suddenly all the strength is gone and youre alone id love to relax some time id love to be able to sleep do you think cathys all right i wish i were a stronger person there is a long awkward silence she sips at her tea reflectively i keep seeing dan fawcetts face they have such big windows at the school all the windows were broken in dans bedroom all the windows do i sound foolish to you cathy at the school do you think cathys all right what good will they do then he saw why didnt al believe my story wheres mitch oh thank you yeah and the freeways welllighted isnt it mitch then you knew mitch in san francisco is that rightlook yes its really up to lydia isnt it do you think i should go it seems so pointless i think ill go to sleep this has been a busy day my luggage he wants me to go to cathys party tomorrow afternoon i said i would and the second i did im sorry forgive me then what are you doing here in bodega bay i see what about mitch didnt he have anything to say about this someone ought to tell her shed be gaining a daughter annie that adds up to a jealous possessive woman i dont understand afraid youd take mitch then why did she object to you then what was it and what had you done a trifle different when was this what do you mean annie theres nothing between mitch and me i suspected as much howd you happen to come here where are you from originally annie i despise it i think so thank you no thank you wont you call me melanie if you have some id no its not the cut thats bothering me yes i just picked up some things for the night at the general store you see i hadnt planned on spending much time here i would appreciate it ive tried everywhere in town and theyre all full that sign do you think i could have the room for a single night i was wondering yes i did thank you lovebirds yes yes well something like that im sorry i dont mean to sound so mysterious no just a few hours its a lovely garden no not really they seemed sure it was either alice or lois the one who lives in the white house across the bay the man at the post office sent me he said youd know the name of the little brenner girl im melanie daniels im sorry to bother you but miss hayworth i guess it does get a little hectic at times i dont know yet darling of course i do i dont think so i have to get back to san francisco i know

it all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills a malcontent he went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings werent fit to rule this planet preaching wherever

annie hayworth why to see a friend of mine will you please be careful to bring your sister those birds you said it was her birthday besides i was coming up anyway didnt you see the lovebirds ouch only violators and practical jokers is that why youd like to see everyone behind bars what kind of law do you practice here so youre a lawyer whats that what made it and im glad you didnt get your lovebirds i think youre a louse you knew i didnt work here you deliberately what do you call your lovebird story if not a practical what are you a policeman i didnt break that window when we never met in court or anyplace else how i dont know you hey wait a minute but how how do you know my name what did you say are you sure you wouldnt like to see a canary instead we have some very nice canaries this week well they get a sort of hangdog expression some of them are yes thats a particularly dangerous time oh certainly its to protect the species well we cant just let them fly around the shop you know doesnt what make me yes we call them that too ahhh here we are lovebirds no sir those are redbirds i think so sir now then let me see no of course not i understand completely sir well yes sir there are lovebirds sir yes what was it you were looking for sir what that would be just fine hello charlie this is melanie i want you to do a favor for me no this is a small one pressure you why charlie darling would i try to pressure you will you call the department of motor vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate dkq dash one seven six yes a california plate no ill stop up there in a little while is daddy in his office oh no no i dont want to break in on a meeting just tell him ill see him later thank you charlie immediately is this the daily news melanie daniels would you get me the city desk please how soon do you have any lovebirds no youd better send him may i use your phone have you got a pencil that that who was that there we are well all right but i think maybe youd better deliver him let me give you my address yes and hell talk well this one wont be a chick will he you said three oclock what do you suppose it is hello mrs macgruder have you ever seen so many gulls maybe is it impossible i dont know anything about birds except that theyre attacking this town maybe theyre all protecting the species maybe theyre tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest no one called it a war i dont know why to to kill them daniels i think they were after the children what were the crows after at the school these werent a few birds yes all right ill wait for you goodby hello may i speak to mitch brenner please yes ill wait i just came from the school madam i dont know about their brain pans but thank you do you know dan fawcetts number theyre different daddy thank you i think these were crows yes hundreds of them yes they attacked the children attacked them daddy a little girl was sent to the hospital in santa rosa well all right but you act as if im all right all right no i cant come home now i just cant daddy how is it there i mean are there birds in the sky but no trouble well i hope i dont know when i simply cant leave now tell mother not to worry all right daddy goodby no the birds didnt attack until the children were outside the school crows i think i dont know daddy is there a difference between crows and blackbirdsbirds are not bad because there are 8650 species of birds in the world today mr carter its estimated that five billion seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the united states alone the five continents of the world the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range in fact during our christmas count we recorded impossible i hardly think either species would have the intelligence to launch a massed attack their brain pans arent large enough for such yes i have never known birds of different species to flock together the very concept is unimaginable why if that happened we wouldnt have a chance how could we possible hope to fight them and what vultures hawks eagles are you discussing gamebirds now all birds are not gamebirds you know i have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do ornithology happens to be my avocation miss daniels youre talking about preservation of the species a hen protecting her young theres a vast difference between doesnt it seem odd that theyd wait all that time to start a a war against humanity i thought not birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx miss daniels a hundred and twenty million years ago for what purpose what do you think they were after miss the gulls were after your fish mr sholes really lets be logical about this i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world insist on making it difficult for life to survive on this planet if it werent for birds birds are not aggressive creatures miss they bring beauty to the world it is mankind rather who theyre both perching birds of course but of quite different species the crow is brachyrhynchos the blackbird is cyanocephalus there is very definitely a difference miss the point is that no one seemed to get upset about it they were gone the next morning just as if nothing at all had happened poor things thats right sir i recall it a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town where all the lights were probably contain more than a hundred billion birds that would hardly be possible they are incapable of organized warfare we need them birds you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much of course it does if we believe that birds are attacking why why next well believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of of course probably herring gulls they arrive in november you know and dont migrate north again until march or which gulls mr sholes there are several varietiesi might be able to have them by tomorrow morning would that be all right well well how soon would you want them no not in the shop but i can order them for you yes certainly they said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon if youd care to come back what oh yes certainly i have no idea oh good oh wonderful im sure theyre on the way though could i just call oh oh well all right yes oh my i suppose i should call them again they said three oclock maybe its the traffic ill call would you mind waiting well yes hell talk well no no youll have to teach him to talk certainly not oh no certainly not this will be a full grown myna bird full grown i know oh i know ive been calling all morning oh you have no idea miss daniels theyre so difficult to get really they are we get them from india you know when theyre just little chicks and then we have to i was hoping youd be a little late miss daniels you see he hasnt arrived yet hello miss danielsim leaving are you coming cant you please finish your drink were the santa rosa police at your school today are you coming put on your coats do you want to get trapped here then lets go nowand back with macfarlane and all that he stands for the next day theres no standing between a fool and his folly if you must babble your news to him hes at the fishermans tryst its the inn at pennycuik you can use macfarlanes horse and gig to get there hell welcome the ride back you dont went to find him your news will keep until i tell him hes not home its a gift to my people and i see macfarlane and gray the pit yawns for them and the flames and i would have you away from them and safe out of the torment listen to me fettes im one part befuddled with drink one part overheels in love with macfarlane and one part fey youre a lowlander fettes and you have no way of knowing what we highlanders call the second sight that porter was gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldnt swallow the shame of it who took my last paltry savings to hire gray they did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the kings counselor pressed him hard how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence and did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against burke gray has no need to threaten you remember the trial if he were only that the mans evil himself some day youll know him as macfarlane knows him for macfarlane he was to knox as you are to him that brought him close to gray he roistered with him and drank with him aye and gray even brought him to my door and my love there is all that between them and more burke and hare and knox im cold as ice he could have been a great man a good man and a fine doctor but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back and always gray gray to hound him to his death is it a great man whom gray can order to his bidding is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that i must play maidservant for the worlds sake and his success save yourself master fettes look at macfarlane and be warned you must leave this house youve been with gray again youre not going to gray ill get him crony indeed no great lady will ever take my place you may deny the devil toddy but youll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead aye aye hes a good lad thats why i ask you macfarlanea doctor theyre uncommon bold the grave robbers and the daft doctors who drive them on hell not leave the grave not since wednesday last when we buried the ladit is a pity its not because of georgina because of dr macfarlanes failure good morning mr fettes pain and shock shes brave enough but i dont know about myself now that it seems so close i wonder if i dare trust my child into any but gods hands maybe he knows best you have his promise then ask this one favor did he tell you about georgina georgina told me how kind you were to her it gave me hope you might intercede for us with dr macfarlane i want you to help my little girl she would if she could im sorry doctor georginas a good child a brave child you saw how she was during the operation but if she cant move she cant move theres nothing i can say for one small child but doctor surely in a case like this a child a little child who can never walk or run but can anything be done for her three years a carriage overturned my husband was killed and georgina was hurt it comes at intervals they used to be

just fixed our car how you doin its ok its ok relax its just a cut we can get it fixed but we need to get you to the hospital now howd you get that youre bleeding pretty bad there ok ok i guess ive been ok then where are you going 112 orchard way realizing in a whisper youre not coming back are you what ok ssh rest because your body can only take so much of what theyre putting you through to the hospital why are you saying that beat we dont have long do we what how can you say that hes the one that put you in that goddamn medievaljacket hes probably the one who killed you thats all you got from him that bastard helped take your life away from you william youre not making sense its sunday beat i dont know i dont know but this isnt a dream im real and so is where we are what what are you thinking beat lost no theyre not here yeah i called the number yesterday to make sure thomas becker retired md here drink this ill get the heat going its not a prison its a hospital theres got to be some way out of there and youve got to find it youve got to get yourself out of that place theyre going to kill you if you dont what about captain medley he never told them what happened to you over there his testimonythat coward wanted them to think you were crazy they told me beckers in shelbourne now i looked him up and he was listed how long do we have because thats the part i believe is true you probably did help her somehow with the boy and eugenes name did come up over and over again on the abstracts i pulled lets see if they have an address for becker i also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with you think lorenson kills you me neither who was the boy she was talking about eugene no they never figured it out i did most murderers dont stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road not without hurting them i know alpine grove still exists i looked it up on the net we should go there and see if theres still anyone around who might have known what happened to you then we need to figure out what happened to you its the only thing we can do softly i want to trust you should i trust you i dont know beat i thought i was crazy after you left that day i died i still think i could be crazy but then i replayed that night in my head the parts of it i could remember and it was likei dont care if i was or am i havent felt that way in a room with someone my whole life beat and when you left all i wanted was i dont know how you got the cut to your head but you died bleeding from it beat you bled to death but no one knew until after it was banned you know and it led to an investigation of dr beckers mistreatment of some of his patients thats when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients the jacket thats what they call it right please im telling you i dont care what time you think youre in youre not william starks beat i dont believe in many things but i believe in death and it doesnt give back what it takes so whoever you arei did a nice thing youve made me regret it enough already so please just leave no its not beat its december 25th 2004 i know what this isi picked you up when i was drunk and you probably thought im just fucked up enough to fall for this but the thing is i know what im doing when i drink i just usually dont care right now i do though and i want you out now i dont know but he did die starks falters under the news jackie looks around through her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in the apartment she settles for the bottle of vodka on the table lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then laughs nervously as she looks up no you didnt they found william starks body dead in the snow i looked it up his body was found new years day 191993 at alpine william starks is dead beat ive been to his grave you cant be william starks hes dead stop it stop it jackie covers her ears and looks at him pleading with her eyes starks eyes plead right back well you belong in one what now youre gon na show me some kind of drivers license if you dont get out of my house right now ill call the police whatd you do snoop all over the place you had no right you had no right to go through anything william starks beat thanks what for whatre those youre just gon na walk yeah but i like it i guess jackie yeah but i dont know what our car wont start come on mom dont fall asleep because becker resigned after the charges brought against him by state patient advocacy groups i dont understand how just a little when we were looking up information about williams father how did he helpwhere beat its becker isnt it hes doing stuff isnt he what should they be looking for its the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about i wish theyd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we dont have i see youve done your homework beat alpine groves undergone a lot of changes since then at the time we didnt have theresources to help our patients the way we needed to beat now we do and things are different i still dont either even after all these years he just saidthat id shock eugene and then things would change for him its complicated but looking at starks in a way your father let me know how id get through to him sure its an easy address a little far out there but easy enough what are you talking about who told you this william i cant indulge these delusions even when youre in this state i do believe you im not gon na let that happen what for youre going to be ok william we just need to get your fever down and well be able to hopefully stabilize you you have nothing to fear william yeah you told me this was how it happened i know i know it all save your strength i already know everything youre going to say beat youre in the jacket right now arent you i dont know how you know about eugene but these ideas are part of your delusions how do you know about eugene william that is just another facet of my delusions and how do you know that why not why dont you help me beat like who like mackenzie maybe what about the world the future doesnt look different ok fine tell me about it tell me about the future 2004 what does it look like well what time is it then help me understand you know youre not alone a lot of gulf vets have begun to experience curious symptoms what you have might well be a syndrome and if so its not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously no i do thats what im saying to you what do you mean youll die if you keep smoking those in your condition well beat let me know how your search turns out its important for you to know who your father was isnt it so maybe

of lint look at this sadly no well except for the lint magda shes not my grandmother actually she rents the apartment right next to mine her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesnt like

why healy must have a sweet tooth see if you can find some cookies sure uh magda why dont you get some more cheese and crackers the point is love isnt about money or social standing or age its about

fighting jets youre not gon na be able to act like a fighter pilot youre gon na have to act like the rest of us youre gon na have to master humility for you guys thats the toughest maneuver of all hey i never said i was a fighter piloti never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm i can find contentment in a good book i dont have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire sometimesi just get happy being with the right man and im gon na sneak off and be by myself for awhile like until i can think of a new careerhotel management or something ive got a gift just like you do my gift is i just know what people mean even if they cant say it it helps when youre trying to communicate with fighter pilots like what you just said was im embarrassed i feel ive done something wrong that ive failed and i dont think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting intelligent woman like yourself that about it i know exactly what you mean long distance i wouldnt do that to you id at least talk to you you werent gon na say goodbye well say it together on the count of threeonetwo looks like a tie your watch and thats one you didnt mean it you didnt think youd do anything to take it back that wasnt fair it was a question penalty round thats up to you take something off true the big one the one thats most on your mind you say the truth go ahead dont be afraid you want to win the game dontcha want to play the game not as silly as some you know the silliest one that we are gods that we control events on the beach that we can turn back time its like strip poker only without the bluffing one person says something and if the other one accepts that its true the one who says it gets to take one item of clothing off its strip reality actually like what the pilots always want to play i like to play reality i sit i think i play games everything passes immutable law of the universe only when youre depressed then it passes you dont believe that of course the lines just imaginary you can cross it twenty timesnothing really changes you look way out there out past the date line west becomes east all things change you cross the linetoday becomes yesterdayor tomorrow i forget which what what do you want i dont think so but if thats what you want do what show you a good time where are we you know where we are its called the beach its where life first crawled up out of the sea i come here sometimes when i feel like crawling back in you knew it you all do its part of it maybe the most important part why you act like you didnt know one day this would happen thats what you get flight pay for thats not what i hear the dark side the price you pay for all the fun youre having you knew about it of course didnt you this is it then they say youre alright whered you get it what do you take me for its a navy cross doesnt it ever bother you danger i dont fly in anything that doesnt show movies im still second best in that order im a professional you guys are in my line of work no fooling on base no signs no comments no talk by anyone i want it understood you always get what you want and now i dont know i dont like being out of control where youre totally insane its just as i thought are you really that brave what if you kill yourself think of everything youll miss maverick there is lots of stuff i dont know about fine wine great art the opera i guess if i live long enough ill get to it if i dont ill never miss it what he saidtheres nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result winston churchill

baby hair does make a difference hes twentyfour now a year older than you and must be bout bald when he was about seventeen he startin losin his hair too bad we all cant baby one thing about dell the private eye cost aunt rootie over a thousand dollars then a little while later dell ran off a third time to some place he said would give him peace of mind nobodys seen him since it aint so funny now though december before christmas dell disappeared again and aunt rootie hired a private eye to find him he was missin for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin dressed in some filthy santa claus suit are followin him around one time real late like about two thirty am she found dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin sandwiches in the kitchen one time aunt rootie caught dell puttin one big cockroach on his anus well like mama told me aunt rootie dells mama she found cockroaches in dells underwear dell disappeared dell was learnin a hard lesson what i learned from observin dell is i think people who are frightened want to disappear hed startin behavin weird like comin up to people every fifteen minutes and askin how they were doin oh nothin i never let on to mama about dell bein the one i just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was i didnt tell dell neither he was back home in chattanooga by then anyhow and i didnt see the point somethin terrible happened to him though six months ago it was my cousin dell done it his folks used to visit with us summers i hope you appreciate my spendin six hundred dollars not countin what it cost us to get here and back this mans the best damn abortionist in the south she got me an abortion i just think about things as they come up i never been much of a planner oh you know exactly what i mean honey itd make the future so simple and nice wouldnt it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives sailor that dont seem fair dont the reject guys get anythin im sorry sweetie i forget some moments where all you been the last two years whats that honey what you have to get personal about so quick all i mean is you could possibly read a book what you want to watch this trash for aint one of those people have a real thought in their brain hell you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all im always ready to dance but i need me a kiss first honey just one that womans laugh creeps me out i heard somethin like that somewhere before soundd like the wicked witch sailor that ozone layer is disappearin seems to me the government could do somethin about it one of these mornings the sunll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an xray uncle pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin in myrtle beach they still got way too much traffic there for my taste and another thing baby that government of ours should be keepin us separated from outer space one hundred twenty decibels head on collision of a 54 ford pickup and a 64 chevy station wagon no survivors balls of flame and grinding metal just you uncle pooch never acted strange or different after and he never did anything else to me i always got a nice present from him at christmas like a coat or jewelry well sure but he was supergentle you know i mean he raped me and all but i guess theres all different kinds of rapes i didnt exactly want him to do it but i suppose once it started it didnt seem all that terrible it was over pretty quick and after uncle pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there i stayed in bed till i heard him drive off then i just went back into the kitchen and finished makin my sandwich he was short but powerful with hairy arms anyway he carried me into the maids dayroom which nobody used we did it there on an old bed no he picked me up uncle pooch came in the side door through the porch you know where i was makin a jelly and banana sandwich i remember i had my hair in curlers cause i was goin that night with vicki and cherry ann the desoto sisters uncle pooch must have known nobody but me was home cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter well mama was at the busy bee havin her hair dyed and i was alone in the house i said you can be too crude sometimes i dont think i care for it youre terrible crude sometimes sailor you know thats true uncle pooch wasnt really an uncle he was a business partner of my daddys and my mama never knew nothin about me and him thats for damn sure his real name was somethin kind of european like pucinski but everyone just called him pooch he came around the house sometimes when daddy was away i always figured he was sweet on mama so when he cornered me one afternoon i was surprised moren a little sailor you are somethin else honey when i was fifteen mama told me that pretty soon id be startin to think about sex and i should talk to her before i did anything about it grandmama pace had a long smooth white neck it was like on a statue it was so white started he couldnt remember things got real violent mama kept tellin me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin the old paint off our house without usin a mask but i dont know seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces you remind me of my daddy you know mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their

to fuck you hey sailor boy you wan na fuck lulas mama yes you heard me dont ever call back here again theres no way in hell you can speak to her andits just that you know i was thinking about how in class youre always telling us that writers make choices at least the good ones and dont get me wrong im not saying the book isnt really great i mean really great but at times its well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyones horses and all the dental records and so on and i dont know maybe im wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like you didnt make any choices at all and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you werent always under the influence no its not that its i uh i didnt finish i fell asleep sure the keys are on the dresser next to to your book it beats whats your major i dont know grady i just dropped him on a corner i told you sewickly heights who does crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet he shot the chancellors dog didnt he the blind one i dont know maybe i dont think so i know i shouldnt have but there it was just sort of lying out and i couldnt resist and and i suck grady i thought we were going to talk last night the one in your office its the best one for naps his bag you know that ratty green thing hes always carrying around he mustve left it inside james is odd i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights i dropped him there once but come to think of it it wasnt even his aunts house he said she worked there or something i dont remember some apartment somewhere but ive never seen it i would if i knew where i was taking him i just mean i i guess emily isnt going to be there when you get home so what are you going to do and i love the inscription you wrote to me only im not quite the downy innocent you think i am ive been rereading arsonists daughter its so beautiful grady so natural its like all your sentences always existed just waiting around in style heaven or wherever for you to fetch them down jamesll know about george sanders ail right by the way his friend just checking i think so what about you i think maybe were missing the point it seems to me james strength as a writer is that he doesnt take us by the hand he treats us like adults he respects us enough to forget us that takes courage i havent heard of half of those just a few then the big ones mr crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself only he couldnt remember how are you riding with me jamesits a bathtub what shes standing under he said he hasnt had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks hes kind of a you mean because his careers ruined and all that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit whats that forget it i shouldve known better your friend is just i dont know into collecting weird tricks mind tony now that im home sure it is disturbed and when your friend crabtree gets done with him hes going to be even more disturbed couldnt he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing i need a ride whos he barking at now thats a nice greenhouse why yes how did you know terry was telling me about you on the plane it was all so interestingi know but sometimes did you just make that up it didnt come up i told walter some times oh dozens its very sad and youre old oh grady youre such a putz terry told me about wonder boys is it true did you lose it all i believe you did that nice doctor let you out or is this you improvising again grady i said it didnt sound like you he told me and what do you think you might have said you didnt happen to call the house last night did you grady its within the realm he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education grady are you sure you parked it there grady and the jacket im not very happy with you right now grady but more importantly walters not very happy and hes gotten the police involved they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this you wouldnt happen to know where james is would you grady it seems one of our students is missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed i tried to call but apparently theres something wrong whats he doing out there whos that sitting in your car that and you no i dont think you do and besides i havent decided yet i believe you i believe you want to be with me but this is not just about me anymore gee grady that sounded so heartfelt i dont know whether to swoon or smirk all right did you pass out again grady did you fall somewhere are you limping why are you limping im kidding hello your fingerprints were all over the bedroom did you confess you heard how walters on campus being the good soldier for wordfest but hes a basket case someone stole marilyns jacket last night and poes missing too i cant believe you hung up on me you dick i love you grady pow heavy smells like gunpowder whos gun is that no you dont and fuck you for saying you do and fuck you for saying for saying theres just no way because there could be a way grady no theres no way i mean dont you think theres no way shell come back thats why im going to to not have this baby you love emily i know that and you need to stay with her dont i know what youre going to say almost want to sit up whats the matter you had another one didnt you you have to see a doctor grady first thing monday morning all right i guess youre going to have to chew it off then neither do i and are you going to tell him has he asked to see the book yet my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite she is a transvestite isnt she is that cristaile so i guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right simple shes left before i think walter would find this a little more than surprising im sure im pregnant you go first walter just got it back from the framer today well then id better show you terry thats funny i need to talk to you too perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp im sorry its these goddamned shoes i dont know how anyone actually walks in these things i got the message you called professor tripp you want to keep him happy i doubt it darling i doubt id recognize a 63 chateau latour if i was sitting on itrobin what does that mean im not pretty i have friends its my bird book see anything interesting my daddy

deserve it tell me once more good night tell me that you love me late very late im too sleepy sandro im not coming down you said you wanted to quit working for ettore sandro listen try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow no sandro we should go besides we havent been in touch with anybody not even with annas father we should have at least sent a wire or telephoned lets be fair he must be feeling awfully lonely did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby oh sandro i want everything you do but what are you saying sandro wait a moment just one moment you seem like an entirely different person no reason why no sandro please sandro whats the matter okay in a few minutes so you wonder why and you leave me here all alone in this hotel room yes yes yes yes right away but why am i so infatuated with you so oh how i wish that everything were so much simpler that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes what size shoe do you wear size 9 thats a very lovely size but im sorry i wear size 8 and are you sure you want to marry me are you really surethat you want to marry me what do i say what can i say no at least not yet i dont know i cant even think of it at a time like this oh but why did you have to ask me what get married im sure youd be able to design some very lovely things and why did you drop them but just think the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times maybe even just before we left while i was waiting outside your place because what im doing is so ugly because if you told me right now claudia i love you i would believe you oh no it doesnt please me at all oh sandro im so ashamed of myself so ashamedi tried to hide myselfi feel so small i hate myself dont think that i want to save myself from any embarrassment from the awkwardness of meeting anna its not that its that you can say certain things easier if youre alone please sandro do try to understand me it would look like i was trying to influence you to force you to control you and that makes me feel uncomfortable sandro maybe its best that you go in alone lets get out of here fast this is not a town its a cemetery any news promise that you wont try to look for me you shouldnt try to look for me any more no sandro please i ask you as a favor me i i please leave me alone no im sure it wont move over there lets make believe nothing happened and when we get to the next station get off but its so sad so terribly sad im not used to it im not ready for it you know i have never been so upset in my life sandro why dont you help me for me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago just three days ago dont you realize and you and anna no i guess they arent like that any more my god is it possible to forget in such a short time for things to change so quickly oh sandro but sooner or later weve got to end this relationship and its better to do it right now sandro i dont want you to come with me i dont want to see you how can i make it clear to youwhy did you come yes you should go have you read it theyre asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them yes i think that you might go and have a look yourself i know i keep asking myself what i could have done to prevent all this from happening occasionally but always with affection yes very much so im sorry about last night please forgive me rather than being so occupied with my thoughts you would have been better off trying to understand what anna was thinking but why dont you tell him a girl who was with us has disappeared and how do you explain that i i dont know i didnt think it was worthwhile she was laughing over it as far as im concerned i think shes alive why even this morning that business about the shark it wasnt at all true find anything im beginning to have my doubts it couldnt be that theyre in love twelve years but why havent they married oh no please not here it looks too dangerous theres nothing much to laugh at how should i be arrogant that seems to apply to you also yes youre right im sick and tired of being like that just several days ago the thought of anna being dead would have made me sick and now i dont even cry im afraid she might be alive everything is becoming so damned simple and easy even to deprive ones self of pain and suffering im afraid that anna has come back i feel shes back and that theyre together patrizia im afraid would you please see if sandro is with him hes not in his room im sorry to disturb you patrizia patrizia wheres ettore it means being without money my childhood instead was a very sensible one how do you manage to put up with all this confusion you always said people bore you shouldnt we try to find a quieter place im not coming do you consider that a compliment its divine it was futile we went all over i just cant leave without first searching those islands one by one im going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands calm he doesnt seem so to me he was awake all night not really its suffocating in here shall we go out one would have to be in love with somebody to know that i would say hes pretty depraved better dead i think all you have to do giulia is to close the door it couldnt be any clearer theyre all nudes if im not mistaken but for what reason should i come there to the sharkdont mention it pleased to be of service any time theres the trinacria hotel or the regina near the municipal building as for rooming houses i dont know wellprobably at the last stop which is noto i only exchanged a few casual words with her as one would ordinarily do on a public busyou should never wish to get melodramatic over anything now listen for gods sake try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea go to your room and get back into bed but whats gotten into you we would have known sandro must be out in the garden somewhere taking a breath of fresh air or watching the break of dawn it would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type more or less we are all afraid especially at night i imagine he must be inside sleeping what do you mean by sensible you shouldnt always take me seriously actually im used to it by now first my mother and now my husband both of them are like dynamos quieter oh yes of course but then why did you bother changing no you say that just to flatter me but where did you finally end up but arent you tired i can just about manage to stand on my feet raimondo to do what what amazes me is sandro he seems so calm have you ever been in love he amuses me i dont know of anything more amusing outside of this jigsaw puzzle dont you find it so claudia oh no quite the contrary hes really just a child tell me claudia what do you think of raimondo well with a shark running loose around the place i for one wont get aboard that raft theyll have to catch it first i want to see it right here before my feet dead or alive yes yes of course nothing nothing at all i was just looking for sandro ettore first let the poor thing have something to eat this is claudia annas friend youve never met my husband have you yes even i had a mother she was part austrian but she was still my mother my childhood was like a tennis match they bounced me back and forth here and there oh no not at all and then you know very well that hell forgive you anything just as long as you admit to him that youre a worse driver than he is you should have told ettore he always manages to get what he wants did you manage to find good rooms and heres sandro why dont you two go upstairs and change weve decided to go to montaldos place in fact ettore should already be there what do you want us to do i dont know myself but well do something i dont see why i should mind but you have to consider all possibilities sandro perhaps she wasnt feeling well maybe a cramp or something claudia isnt coming with us will you please take care of her luggage thanks take it easy raimondo why are you getting so impatient you know i dont love anybody now tell the truth arent you a bit disappointed but i already told you raimondo do you enjoy fishing underwater why have we stoppedmusic of course to get a sweetheart one has to look around but to get a radio all you have to do is buy one certainly a radio this small is very practical its especially useful for i dont know

favourite its martha mama there you go its your favourite hello mama brought you something uh huh the one up on the third floor sister anne which was agnes room well thats a lot of land you must have help do you have field hands that help you how do you survive i dont understand are you expecting me to look father ah just because i dont subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to what business is it of yours who told you this what does this have to do with why do you call it an investigation i never have no wasnt it what happened to the baby agnes what happened to the baby i doubt thats what shed say before or after you killed the child you tied the cord around its neck and the baby you hid the wastepaper basket in her room you wanted that child out of the way you went to the room to help with the birth the baby too late for what for what an abortion and you didnt send her to a doctor did you know she was pregnant was it you who knew she was pregnant i have a few more questions to ask her where is she who was that person mother was it you because its murder were talking about arent you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room oh would you stop lying mother somebody told her theres a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn did you know about that theres an answer mother thats how she got out thats what i have to believe but she is not an enigma mother everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry one two three right down the line but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wont face the fact that she was raped or seduced or that she did the seducing i thought you didnt believe in miracles today mother but how did it happen youre saying god did it this is insane well give me a reasonable explanation how my god youre as crazy as who is he how how she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously is that supposed to convince me she shouldnt be touched give me a miracle you think shes a saint for the church one that will ask the questions you want asked youre what no no i said leave her alone of course no the hypnotism do you still disapprove id like to begin do you think agnes is still attached to god well you can try cant you to be good do you want to become one do you think they ever existed right what do you suppose todays saints are smoking oh youve come a long way baby right saint peter hand rolled long thin and filtered do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then all right would you like one huh my sister died in a convent and its her voice i hear does my smoking bother you no because i yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles i wasnt i wasnt she was the pretty one she died why not me i never said my morning prayers and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston thats all thats enough she was a beautiful little girl it wasnt sex it was a lot of things but it wasnt sex you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said she died because she hadnt said her morning prayers nothing you just said catholic church doesnt have a corner on morality bullshit then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh an unhappy woman i dont give a damn about her spiritual health the womans health is at stake dont deny it id like yours too oh god why didnt you do anything to stop her why didnt you you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic there is more here than meets the eye isnt there lots of dirty little secrets she molested her do you know what she did to her listening to angels like keeping her home from school and agnes father no it just makes you doubly responsible doesnt it your niece you lied to me sister paul when was that what sheets what is it was the child full term take at look at it do you have a a diary or a day book visitors to the convent do you remember anything unusual happening at the time when would agnes have conceived the child answers innocence legal innocence i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court aquittal theres another choice no youre shielding her let her face the world then help her virginity right mother poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by and she has a right to know that theres a world out there filled with people who dont believe in god and arent any worse off than you mother people whove gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody and people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy she has a right to know that but you and your your order and your church have kept her ignorant or bullied or what ever youre doing who the hell do you think you are you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child how dare you think im in a position to be pressured how dare you tell me to run my affairs i havent said anything against the the catholic church i hate ignorance and stupidity what and i intend to take her away from him thats what youre afraid of isnt it its being doing it for centuries shes not unique shes just another victim not simple no she has it now she had a a hole in the palm of her hand she could have bled to death why didnt you take her to a doctor this was before her pregnancy and what happened and you werent shocked when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks well its been known to happen in the day too maybe agnes went to him that possibility never occurred to you one of the other nuns found out about the baby and and wanted to avoid a scandal its possible isnt it that she was unconscious yes so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the and in your eyes so someone else could have done it if shes so innocent how come she murdered a child thats ridiculous how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth from other nuns yes i ive noticed whats your opinion i am not with the inquisition the science of psychiatry well im the doctor im the one whos going to decide what is or is not important here why do you think that look someone gave her the baby why havent you asked her and you didnt try to find out who could there have been anyone else whats his name was there a priest what man had access to her who was the father didnt she have any physical examinations in this time how did she hide it during the day is that normal how did she hide it from the other nuns who knew about agnes pregnancy i can beat that you were a smoker thank you yes ithat was the beginning the night of the conception thats why she burnt the sheets for what should you see a doctor what do you mean a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility say it how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of why then tell me where are your sheets it made them uncomfortable and if they didnt sleep well im certain the next day they were cranky as mules sister where are your sheets do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin were not in the middle ages sister why sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister is that true dear jesus why yes of god my dear i dont think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything youve got to eat something agnes nonsense im your mother now and i want you to eat your mother tells you this agnes your mother is dead who oh my dear child agnes dear heaven is not a place where thats not what he meant who tells you these things agnes why who told you this he loves you the way you are you neednt worry about being attractive here why does it matter whether youre fat or not agnes oh for heavens sake who one of the other sisters why who through someone else he talked to you himself agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating why is this agnes ive been commanded by god oh dont do this she cant remember thats enough then shes a liar i left it with her and i went for help i wanted her to have it when noone else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked no i didnt hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets thats a lie she didnt want any help the scandal i dont know too late to stop it oh dont be ridiculous i didnt guess until it was too late yes is it because shes a nun why do you insist upon pressing my god but youre determined hasnt she had enough this is permission to take her apart if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me and definitely not agnes im concerned about her health why would i lie who that tun that tunnel hasnt been used in fifty years thats crazy how could she find out about it then why are you so obsessed with her youre losing sleep over her youre thinking about her all the time youre bent on saving her why thats what you believe she is the sum of her psychological parts she is an innocent but i want the opportunity to believe i want the choice to believe youll never find the answer for everything god did there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out a miracle is an event without an explanation if shes capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldnt she split a cell in her womb dont be ridiculous stop laughing i dont say its the truth im saying why must he be anybody the father shes been touched by god yes for agnes one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes well find our own thank you ive just met with the bishop were taking you off the case stop this shell hurt herself im not going to allow this then lets begin may i be present would it stop you if i did begin what listen to her singing yes but goodness has very little to do with it not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy but they were still attached to god agnes has that birth no more were born we live we die no room for miracles oh my dear how i miss the miracles become one is born a saint yes i do there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those im afraid we are sorely lacking and saint john would chew tobacco mary magdelen pipe even christ would partake socially saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet and of course undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more fine thanks im out of prac practice id love one no it reminds me so you left the church because you had freckles and what has that to do with it stupid woman and thats all what have we done to hurt you and dont deny it i can smell an excatholic a mile away what did we do burn a few heretics sell some indulgences that was in the days when the church was a ruling body we let governments do those things today so what did we do to you eh you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldnt because it was a sin what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you who said anything about the catholic church bullshit yourself because i am a moral person shes happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone i know you dont her spiritual health i havent decided yet well see about that and my permission because i didnt know i knew that after the fact oh god if only id known oh dear god i dont think i care to know she drank too much thats what killed her yes i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent my sister ran away from home we lost touch with her and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened i didnt tell you because i didnt think it was important about what yes i dont remember where agnes was i was needed in the sick room the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away oh dear god i should have guessed the sheets oh dear god theres nothing here yes nothing earthquakes oh some time in january all right what do you need how what what good would it do no matter what you decide its either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin i am i am not a virgin doctor i was married for twenty three years two daughters i even have grandchildren surprised it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother my children wont even see me any more thats their revenge i think they tell their friends that ive passed on and dont tell me im making up for past mistakes doctor freud she is not a child im only interested its my affair too catholicism is not on trial here i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else the catholic church nuns you hate nuns you hate us dont you gods victim thats her innocence she belongs to god i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that i know what youre thinking shes a hysteric pure and simple but she didnt did she if anyone had seen what id seen shed be public property newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule she doesnt deserve that it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again about two years before she stopped eating completely i was appalled just as you are now shortly after she came to us oh come on youve talked to her she doesnt even know how babies are born let alone made this convent is locked solid the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldnt let christ in after dark noone knew about agnes pregnancy noone not even agnes thats absurd who you dont really believe something like that happened do you ive already told you what i thought no not in the eyes of the police she didnt this is manslaughter not murder she didnt consciously kill that baby shed lost a lot of blood she was unconscious by the time we got to her in her case it isnt shes had very little schooling her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us shes never been out there doctor shes never seen a movie or a television show shes never even read a book because shes an innocent shes a slate thats hasnt been touched except by god from other people i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying i believe agnes is different well what do you think is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre or maybe shes perfectly sane and just a very good liar and i am not from the middle ages i know what you are i dont want that mind cut open exactly i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible she wont hold up under any sort of cross examination look doctor i dont know how to tell you this politely but i dont approve of you not you personally dont ask me those questions dear im not the patient yes but that was some ten months ago i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial she cant even remember the birth do you think shed admit to the conception believe me ive done everything possible short of asking agnes obviously there was father martineau but i dont see him as a candidate yes but i none as far as i know i havent a clue were examined once a year her pregnancy fell in between the doctors visits she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to yes she undressed alone she bathed alone noone unfiltered two packs a day you must have tons of questions you may smoke if you want to just dont tell any of the sisters you can call me sister im afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and ageyes oh that one there in the corner no we work the land alone noone but sister marguerite and i are permitted contact with the public oh we own the land around here but we rent it out we keep a few acres for ourselves some wheat corn some vegetables the convent was built for over fifty not many of us left just us and the chickensof course yes pity and what do you do about it well its nice to know you think were clever and you honestly think thats what she meant is she not really but im probably not a toffee maker how would you do those lines of mine why selfish i only enjoy acting for myself i hate it when other people are let in is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself i bet you dont sound like real people what are you they ought to be but thats not like a real person at all but the way you did it then sounded so phony the big hammer whats that mean yes no im a walkon in a fancy dress scene i just felt like doing those lines im

banging on my door he couldnt sleep he told me hes left karen he couldnt go on with the play or anything else until i promised to marry him we sat and talked until it was light he never went home we decided the night before last before we came up here she doesnt know addison wont it be just perfect lloyd and i theres no telling how far we can go hell write great plays for me ill make them be great youre the only one ive told the only one that knows except lloyd and me you have no right to say such things im in love with lloyd its nothing of the kind lloyd loves me i love him i didnt mean just the theater addison just a few minutes ago when i told you this would be a night to remember that it would bring me everything i wanted addison lloyd and i thats for tonight youre invited were having everyone up after the performance lloyd i never have any and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish so he sent it up max is paying for it he and lloyd had a terrific row but lloyd insisted well can i fix you a drink whyd call me a killer why not plenty of time for a nice long nap we rehearsed most of last night what time stars you know me better than that itll be a night to remember itll bring to me everything ive ever wanted the end of an old road and the beginning of a new one arent you stop rehearsing your column isnt it strange addison i thought id be panicstricken want to run away or something instead i cant wait for tonight to come to come and go just like it what a day what a heavenly day i confide in you and rely on you more than anyone ive ever known to say a thing like that now without any reason when i need you more than ever i dont think thats funny just like that oddly enough she didnt say a word about margo just that shell be happy to do what she can to see that i play the part i discussed it very openly i told her that i had spoken to lloyd and that he was interested nothing of the kind karen and i had a nice talk just some coffee you take charge im about to go into the shower i wont be able to hear you eddie yes the shubert yes i do thats right im not enough for a paragraph id love to or should i pretend im busy even if i wanted to as you say be less humble blow my own horn how would i do it im less than nobody even so one isolated pretty good performance by an understudy itll be forgotten tomorrow i dont think ive done anything to sound off about please do its not modesty i just dont try to kid myself youre more than kind but its still miss channings performance im just a carbon copy you read when you cant find the original i consider myself lucky they didnt throw things certainly mr dewitt find out you hear all kinds of things you think and for you when you told me that whatever i became it would be because of you then face it i have since that first night here in the dressing room youre always after truth on the stage what about off dont run away bill everything so am i is that what you want me to be you shouldnt have had any doubts are you proud of me bill yes yes it does goodbye mr sampson of course not i have a suggestion theres really not much time left i mean you havent had a minute alone yet and well i could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket if youd like every day i read george jean nathan every week so few come back but hollywood you mustnt stay there i just asked a simple question then why why if youre the best and most successful young director in the theater is it the money why you have to go out there why i just wondered you said fortyseven minutes youll never make it eve eve harrington thats the door its after one now you wont get home till all hours how long does it take howd you get all the way up here from brooklyn dont bother the maidll fix it in the morning i might erasmus hall thats in brooklyn isnt it ive heard of them what report to whom probably not what for you were just looking around how did you get in here what are you doing here who are you thank you karen but not all of it not that lloyd and i are going to be married id do much more for a part that good that wont be necessary addison knows how margo happen to miss that performance how i happened to know shed miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town its quite a story addison could make quite a thing of it imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth i had a time persuading him youd better sit down you look a bit wobbly if i play cora addison will never tell what happened in or out of print a simple exchange of favors and im so happy i can do something for you at long last your friendship with margo your deep close friendship what would happen to it do you think if she knew the chap trick youd played on her for my benefit and you and lloyd how long even in the theater before people forgot what happened and trusted you again no it would be so much easier on everyone concerned if i were to play cora and so much better theater too addison wants me to play it cora is my part youve got to tell lloyd its for me it could have been fifteen years ago its my part now if you told him so hed give me the part he said he would something most important you can do i wish i could believe that ill never get over it i wish id never met him id like him to be dead i want my friends back hes not my friend you were my friends an understudys performance some vague promises of a test thats all if a particular part should come along one of those things im not crying youve really got a low opinion of me havent you well ill give you some pleasant news ive been told off in no uncertain terms all over town miss channing should be happy to hear that to know how loyal her friends are how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be no i dont expect you to believe anything except that the responsibility is mine and the disgrace in a way you find yourself trying to say what you mean but somehow the words change and they become his words and suddenly youre not saying what you mean but what he means you know ive always considered myself a very clever girl smart good head on my shoulders that sort of thing never the wrong word at the wrong time but then id never met addison dewitt i remember once i had a tooth pulled they gave me some anaesthetic i dont remember the name and it affected me in a strange way i heard myself saying things i wasnt even thinking as if my mind were someplace outside of my body and couldnt control what i did or said why shouldnt you please sit down oh but there is ive got a lot to say and none of it is easy cant we sit down just for a minute i dont expect you to be pleasant i was wondering whether youd come at all nothing definite yet its just to have lunch were having lunch with a movie talent scout mostly relief that i managed to stagger through it at all please may i have your coat karen you wont forget will you what we talked about before well if shes got to pick on someone id just as soon it was me if i thought id offended her of all people but there must be some reason something ive done without knowing i seem to be forever thanking you for something dont i you wont forget it then would you talk to mr fabian about it but mr richards and mr sampson do you think miss channing would approve the show must go on i dont let myself think about it even but i do know the part so well and every bit of the staging thered be no need to break in a new girl but suppose i had to go on one night to an audience that came to see margo channing no i couldnt possibly well miss channings affairs are in such good shape there isnt enough to keep me as busy as i should be really not that ive ever considered anything that would take me away from her but the other day when i heard mr fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby and theyd have to replace her karen isnt it awful im about to ask you for another favor after all youve already done mrs richards there should be a new word for happiness being here with miss channing has been i just cant say shes been so wonderful done so much for me hollywood some hollywood movie star her plane got in late id like that ill be at the old stand tomorrow matinee i think id better its been well i can hardly find the words to say how its been it couldnt possibly interest you well if i only knew how hello miss channing i thought youd forgotten about me eve eve harrington but if id known maybe some other time i mean looking like this no id be imposing on her id be just another tonguetied gushing fan oh no standing room doesnt cost much i manage oh no i see the play hes the best youre margo channings best friend you and your husband are always with her and mr sampson whats he like ive seen you so often it took every bit of courage i could raise i hope you dont mind my speaking to you why should you think i wouldnt be i was dreadful miss channing believe me i have no right to be anyones understudy much less yours i hope so mr richards good night farmers were poor in those days thats what dad was a farmer i had to help out so i quit school and i went to milwaukee i became a secretary in a brewery when youre a secretary in a brewery its pretty hard to make believe youre anything else everything is beer it wasnt much fun but it helped at home and there was a little theater group like a drop of rain in the desert thats where i met eddie he was a radio technician we played liliom for three performances i was awful then the war came and we got married eddie was in the air force and they sent him to the south pacific you were with the owi werent you mr richards thats what whos who says well with eddie gone my life went back to beer except for a letter a week one week eddie wrote he had a leave coming up id saved my money and vacation time i went to san francisco to meet him eddie wasnt there they forwarded the telegram from milwaukee the one that came from washington to say that eddie wasnt coming at all that eddie was dead so i figured id stay in san francisco i was alone but couldnt go back without eddie i found a job and his insurance helped and there were theaters in san francisco and one night margo channing came to play in remembrance and i went to see it and well here i am i guess it started back home wisconsin that is there was just mum and dad and me i was the only child and i made believe a lot when i was a kid i acted out all sorts of things what they were isnt important but somehow acting and makebelieve began to fill up my life more and more it got so that i couldnt tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me im talking a lot of gibberish arent i well it started with the play before this one there was an item in the times i like the title footsteps on the ceiling id like anything miss channing played no thank you yes ive seen every performance how do you do mr richards and if youd come in the middle id have stopped i couldnt have gone on well if youd been here to begin with i wouldnt have dared to read at all miss channing i cant tell you how glad i am that you arrived so late hello miss channing good evening mr dewitt the hors doeuvres are here is there anything else i can do of course id like to hear it if youd like im sorry i didnt mean to mr sampsons birthday i certainly wouldnt forget that youd never forgive me as a matter of fact i sent him a telegram myself well i was sure youd want to of course being his birthday and youve been so busy these past few days and last night i meant to tell you before you went out with the richards and i guess i was asleep when you got home oh golly and i forgot to tell you thats my job see you at tea time right here ive got it oh come now as though you were an old lady im on my way is there anything more youve thought of i can imagine you know all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there are you sure you wont want it yourself well what do you think of my elegant new suit no trouble at all while youre cleaning up ill take this to the wardrobe mistress the curtains i made them myself you havent noticed my latest bit of interior decorating during your second act scene with your father roger ferradays supposed to stay way upstage at the arch hes been coming closer down every night i mean the performance except for you youd think hed never even directed it its disgraceful the way they change everything around i must say you can certainly tell mr sampsons been gone a month i could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time well if im not in the way the four of you must have so much to say to each other with mr sampson leaving san francisco it was the last week i went one night the most important night in my life until this one anyway i found myself going the next night and the next and the next every performance then when the show went east i went east not with you in them not by mr richards well if i didnt come to see the play i wouldnt have anywhere else to go please dont misunderstand me mr richards i think that part of miss channings greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays your new play is for miss channing isnt it mr richardsi call myself phoebe phoebe its a very famous name mr dewitt miss harringtons resting mr dewitt she asked me to see who it is you rest ill get it i dont care if i never get home with changing and everything a little over an hour subway ill just pick up the broken glass that spilled drink is going to ruin your carper youre going to hollywood arent you from the trunks youre packing you must be going to stay a long time lots of actresses come from brooklyn barbara stanwyck susan hayward of course theyre just movie stars ours was one of the first erasmus hall im the president about how you live what kind of clothes you wear what kind of perfume and books things like that you know the eve harrington clubs that theyve got in most of the girls high schools it was for my report you probably wont believe me thats all i hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed she mustve forgot something and when she went to get it she left the door open i sneaked in and hid till she finished then i just looked around and pretty soon i was afraid somebodyd notice the lights were on so i turned them off and then i guess i fell asleep please dont have me arrested please i didnt steal anything you can search me i i guess i fell asleep miss harringtonits new margo but shes just as late as the old one margo you were there at the play last night then youve heard too then stop being a star start treating your guests as your supporting cast everything everythings so funny when when are you going to do it i guess at this point im what the french call de trop we know you weve seen you before like this is it over or just beginning good luck genius right here a minute ago youve already met this is eve harrington bill bill bill bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here what did you expect live sables but she just got here margo does not play a lunatic birdie no thanks birdie congratulations eve she knows enough not to be here a part in a play youd do all that just for a part in a play over my dead body i dont think anything in the world could make me say that you talk just as addison said you did after all youve said dont you know the part was written for margo you want to play cora you want me to tell lloyd i think you should play it i think i know give yourself time dont worry too much about what people think youre very young and very talented and believe it or not if theres anything i can do yes you will you theater people always do nothing is forever in the theater love or hate success or failure whatever it is its here it flares up and burns hot and then its gone eve i i dont think you meant to cause unhappiness but you did more to yourself perhaps as it turned out than to anyone else he can help you well i think youre painting the picture a little darker than it is really if nothing else and dont underestimate him you have a powerful friend in addison but the raves about your performance tell me how did your lunch turn out with the man from hollywood eve dont cry lets not get overdramatic do you expect me to believe that you didnt say any of those things that they were all addison and you felt just like that talking to addison and easy or not i wont believe a word there cant be very much i dont intend to be dont get up and dont act as if i were the queen mother they certainly dont waste much time eve ive heard the most wonderful things about your performance dont bother i can take it up myself no eve i wont forget eve im fond of margo too but i know margo and every now and then there is nothing i want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants the reason is margo and dont try to figure it out einstein couldnt you mustnt mind margo too much even if i do i wont forget of course theyll do as theyre told i think she would cheer no dear margo must go on as a matter of fact i see no reason why you shouldnt be margos understudy dont worry too much about that margo just doesnt miss performances if she can walk crawl or roll she plays you want to be margos new understudy nobodys done so much eve youve got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases what is it karen lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality next to that sable my new mink seems like an old bedjacket youve done your share eve youve worked wonders with margo tell me eve how are things with you happy discouraging isnt it women with furs like that where it never gets cold now whos show up at this hour its time people went home hold that coat up whose is it not just that way as a friend good night eve i hope i see you again soon youre not going are you eve why dont you start at the beginning try my husband not at all margo this is eve harrington you look just fine by the way whats your name there isnt another like you there couldnt be shes got to meet you im going to take you to margo you see the play youve seen the play every performance but dont you find it i mean apart from everything else dont you find it expensive hell agree with you tell me what do you between the time margo goes in and comes out just huddle in that doorway and wait bill sampson hes hes a director to speak to just a playwrights wife im the lowest form of celebrity not at all why should you be after all six nights a week for weeks of watching even margo channing enter and leave a theater so there you are it seemed odd suddenly your not being there i remember check with tears well all right lloyd says its a publicity release i cant believe eve said those things i just cant believe it this i cant tell you how sorry i am margo margo i want you to know how sorry i am about this well silly isnt it youd think theyd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm not to you not to bill margo bill is all of eight years younger than you why should he and why should you hes in love with you what about bill youre margo just margo were never deeply angry we just get sore the way you do we know you too well weve all seemed a little tense lately it doesnt matter i just never think of lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down he always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical none in sight there arent many along this back road three or four miles roughly ten minutes of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet margo nothing youve ever done has made me as happy as your taking eve in margo really i was telling margo and lloyd about how often youd seen the play harrington shes just outside the door well theres one indoors now ive brought her back to see you theyre your fans your audience yes it is youre talented famous wealthy people waiting around night after night just to see you even in the wind and rain its just that you get me so mad sometimes of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about i find these wisecracks increasingly less funny aged in wood happens to be a fine and distinguished play hi hello darling then tell me this isnt true that your concern for your play and career is one thing and that poor frightened hysterical girl another and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career have you forgotten about eve what she is what shes done im a human being ive got some did miss harrington tell you to call mr richards nothing not much nothing much she apologized i have no possible interest in anything shed have to say what are you going to wear margo such as theyd die without each other margo in the cub room i couldnt be more surprised if shed said grants tomb the cynicism you refer to i acquired the day i discovered i was different from little boys on her knees i have no doubt very touching very academyofdramatic arts it strikes me that eves disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious margo channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise lloyd richards you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of cora with gestures of course eve would ask abbott to give her costello now youre quoting addison or eve maybe get some younger actress for the part someone whod look the part as well as play it im beginning to catch up im trying hard to follow you thats quite a change of subject i wonder why that was a pity eve whered you get all that information dont joke about such things youll break your neck on that ice i guess i didnt look you know i dont pay attention to those things lloyd be careful i just dont want margo to miss her train as it is shell barely make the theater what time is it were driving out to the country tomorrow night just the four of us bill margo you and i its going to be a cozy weekend margo hasnt done badly by it dont run out of adjectives dear its just possible she didnt thats on time for margo margo again lloyd what happened in a minute its about time we did its about time margo realized that whats attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off if youd only see her youre her whole life you must have spotted her by now shes always there you cant put her out i promised margo youve got to see her she worships you its like something out of a book the critics thought so the audiences certainly think so packed houses tickets for months in advance i cant see that either of lloyds last two plays have hurt you any loudthe implication being that i have not been reading them as written how nice for lloyd and how nice for eve how nice for everybody a mass of music and fire thats me an old kazoo and some sparkles tell me was bill swept away too or were you too full of revelation to notice how nice i take it she read well was she that bad just slipped your mind how how was miss caswell of course i knew eve my understudy i consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy is it really i must start wearing a watch i never do you know who read with miss caswell bill lloyd well it couldnt have been max who over it cant be ive come to read with her i promised max its good luck before an audition shell be all right once it starts the ladies shall we say lounge why so remote addison i should think youd be at the side of your protegee lending her moral support amen then you two must have a long talk youve heard of her great interest in the theater eve this is an old friend of mr dewitts mother miss caswell miss harrington addison ive been wanting you to meet eve for the longest time i do not how do you do i distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list what are you doing here a foursquare upright downright forthright married lady thats for me and no more make believe off stage or on remember lloyd i mean it now grownup women only i might even play a mother only one child of course not over eight lloyd will you promise not to be angry with me im going to have a home not just a house im afraid to stay in and a man to go with it ill look up

stuff lots of technique but not right away first the business of fighting them off chin up stout fella with tears karen in all the years of our friendship i have never let you go to the ladies room alone but now i must i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there the little witch must have had indians runners out snatching critics out of bars steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up well she wont get away with it nor will addison dewitt and his poison pen if equity or my lawyer cant or wont do anything about it i will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down mr dewitts ugly throat in this rat race everybodys guilty till theyre proved innocent one of the differences between the theater and civilization what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance it get better about the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched first ladies of the stage to encourage shall we say younger actresses about miss harringtons own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity my hat which has lo these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears is lifted to miss harrington i am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops i thought that one went out with woollcott down here here listen to this miss harrington had much to tell and these columns shall report her faithfully about the lamentable practice in our theater of permitting shall we say mature actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory dont give it another thought one of destinys many pranks after all you didnt personally drain the gasoline out of the tank about what lets not fumble for excuses not here and now with my hair down at best lets say ive been oversensitive to well to the fact that shes so young so feminine and helpless to so many things i want to be for bill funny business a womans career the things you drop on your way up the ladder so you can move faster you forget youll need them again when you go back to being a woman thats one career all females have in common whether we like it or not being a woman sooner or later weve all got to work at it no matter what other careers weve had or wanted and in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed and there he is without that youre not woman youre something with a french provincial office or a book full of clippings but youre not a woman slow curtain the end about eve ive acted pretty disgracefully toward her too i dont suppose the heater runs when the motor doesnt isnt that what they always say those years stretch as the years go on ive seen it happen too often bills in love with margo channing hes fought with her worked with her loved her but ten years from now margo channing will have ceased to exist and whats left will be what more than anything in this world i love bill and i want bill i want him to want me but me not margo channing and if i cant tell they apart how can he what about bill and what is that besides something spelled out in light bulbs i mean besides something called temperament which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice infants behave the way i do you know they carry on and misbehave theyd get drunk if they knew how when they cant have what they want when they feel unwanted and insecure or unloved so many people know me i wish i did i wish someone would tell be about me come to think of it i havent been very pleasant for weeks for that im truly sorry more than any two people i know i dont want you and lloyd to be angry with me karen i havent been pleasant this weekend i detest cheap sentiment do you want it on be brave hell come back with or without gas it seems to me that walking for most people is not very dangerous not many car either not much chance of a lift any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas how far to the station how much time have we peace and quit is for libraries that little place just two hours form new york its on my list of thingsillneverunderstand like collecting shrunken indian heads im so happy youre happy please dont play governess karen i havent your unyielding good taste i wish id gone to radcliffe too but father

keep the audience from leaving the theater then you listened as if someone else had written you play whom did you have in mind sherwood arthur miller beaumont and fletcher perfectly innocent man have been hanged for less im lied to attacked behind my back accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately as if it were holy gospel not mouse never mouse if anything rat in this case apparently as trustworthy as the world almanac its right to the point also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them i mean among other things that it must have been a revelation to have your twentyfouryearold character played by twentyfouryearold actress to you too im sure im sure you underestimate yourself eve you always do you were about to tell

every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler well part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you wont read is that somehow youve done more for my mother my son and me than anyone else ever has and that makes you the most important surprising generous person ive ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever what you did changed my

chatting with you hes got ta fight to breathe his asthma can just shoot off the charts hes allergic to dust and this is new york and his immune system bails on him when theres trouble so an ear

things werent done they havent done the standard scratch test where they make small injections into the skin have they done skin testing for allergies only in the emergency room or when he was well

work do you do hes in the bathroom hes fine mrs connelly im martin bettes dr bettesoh god i see it was nice what okay right shit what martin i know thats why im attracted to you i mean you make me nervous youre intimidating maybe its my curiosityselfpreservation thing but all i can really think about right now is kissing you that doesnt sound normal maybe you should see a psychiatrist uhhuh when did it start were you attracted to me right away is this becoming complicated was she the only one did you what happened to her who was she it happened to you before attraction is a complication is that why you didnt want to talk about women before is it a physical thing or a mental thing why are you attracted to me am i attractive can i ask you something im playing white remember you cant tell me which pieces to move it doesnt work that way why what he believed it all went back to one night when as a little girl i watched my parents have this big fight really big i thought my mother was going to kill my father then they went into their room and made up and i watched them make love through the keyhole he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of selfpreservation so i could watch the girl that lived under me i dont know when i was in college i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor i know it makes me crazy no isnt it interesting though i mean look at us in this room or yesterday when we were walking in the plaza market i mean we look like just another couple but what are we doesnt it seem so crazy she is married but not to him another man much older she has four kids the young guy works for her and i think she likes kinky sex i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them i wanted to so i did nobody ever sees me it was no big deal i saw them leave i went in i went into their room this afternoon when i first saw them i thought they were married did you think they were newlyweds so i hate bishops theyre useless i like knights i think i got one today do you have ulcers ten years later here you are again you didnt take it was that it what did he want what happened ten years ago i dont believe that what is it i dont like this at all what is going on here you killed him here in this city outside that bank for nicholai you cant know for sure how

tell you when he leaves the hotel and youll tell me when he leaves the bank that means you wont have a gun what what if he brings it with him why wont he wait until the bank closes aiiee more waiting i dont know if i like this plan okay then what but he wont shoot you right then check fine they saw you coming a mile away if i had known wed be using cheap as shit two way ive always wanted to learn

inconvenience for you would you like us to notify anyone for you wont your injury prevent you from attending to business mr gardiner i admire that in a person as for myself i find there is so much to

looking all over would you care to take it sir mr gardiner i have a telephone call for you sidney courtney the financial editor of the washington posti know robert but strangely enough i dont feel too bad about now i feel all right i guess its easier knowing chauncey is here to take care of things no more robert no more needles in a minute robert in a minute chauncey i would like to ask a favor of you we have common foes chauncey kid lawyers and our physician no of course you dont excuse me for being so presumptuous no man knows everything about another man however very few are honest enough to admit it of course by kidlawyers i know exactly what you mean today the businessman is at the mercy of kidlawyers from the sec all they want to do is regulate our natural growth its happening across the country ive worked very hard and enjoyed my life ive known success and ive felt love my associates chauncey ive talked with them about you theyre eager to meet you very eager to meet you im very fond of you chauncey and i understand eve tell her that tell her im madly in love with her she cares for you and she needs your help chauncey theres much to be looked after let me feel the strength in your hand chauncey let me feel your strength yes thats good i hope chauncey i hope that youll stay with eve take care of her watch over her shes a delicate flower chauncey im about to surrender the horn of plenty for the horn of gabriel my boy chauncey chauncey good together the two of you should create quite a stir i can already hear the gossip senator rowleys widow sophie is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring ambassador skrapinov of the soviet union i think its rather obvious that robert wont allow me to attend so would you go in my place and escort eve and now chauncey im afraid you must excuse me im very tired all of a sudden and please chauncey dont rush your decision i know youre not a man to act on the spur of the moment oh sure you do the financial assistance program i think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking id like you to meet with the members of the board well be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time you know chauncey theres something about you youre direct you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly you dont play games with words to protect yourself i feel i can speak to you frankly you know what i was talking to you about last night he was quite impressed with your comments chauncey he hears my sort of analysis from everyone but yours unfortunately seldom if ever at all hes a decent fellow the president isnt he i think what my most insightful friend is saying mr president is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position chauncey maybe one day yes when i was younger i had thoughts about public office but i found chauncey that i was able to contribute more as a private citizen of course my wealth provided me with considerable influence but ive tried believe me not to misuse that power its extremely important chauncey when one is in a position of eminence that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country the temptations are strong and ive been labeled a kingmaker by many but i have tried to stay open to voices of the people i have tried to remain honest to myself no one likes a dying man my boy because few know what death is all we know is the terror of it but youre an exception chauncey thats what i admire in you your marvelous balance you dont stagger back and forth between fear and hope youre a truly peaceful man hah its all makeup chauncey i asked nurse teresa to fix me up i didnt want the president to think i was going to die during our talk well thats good news my boy chauncey up and around this morning are you oh robert take a look would you reluctant to speak eh chauncey well i can understand that when a man loses everything anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time just give it some thought work with the idea im sure youll have plenty to say in a few days yes im sure it is thats what they say anyway now wait a minute chauncey you are young you are healthy for gods sake dont give up on yourself you have to fight you cant let those bastards keep you down i dont want to hear any more from you about the room upstairs thats where im going soon bravo a gardener well put chauncey excellent isnt that what a businessman is a gardener a person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands who waters it with the sweat from his own brow and who creates a place of value for his family and community yes chauncey what a brilliant metaphor yes indeed a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard do we have a garden hah tomorrow chauncey you will see our gardens and im ben thats good mr gardiner or may i call you chauncey whatd i tell you kidlawyers the sec damn them oh when you say your house has been closed you mean to say that your business was shut down so am i my boy so am i you will join us for dinner wont you mr gardiner were prisoners mr gardiner were prisoners of tubes and technology failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells not a damn thing they can do about it oh they can make me comfortable prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions and what makes my blood boil what little i have left that is mr gardiner is that its generally a young persons disease here i am getting on in years and about to die of a young persons disease sure you do this ward is air tight i have a little extra oxygen pumped in keeps my spirits up welcome to rand memorial hospital mr gardiner thank you chauncey thank you very much all right robert im all yours thats good thats good im becoming quite attached to chauncey quite attached and so are you arent you eve do you need a secretary hah tell me the truth eve if i wait until i feel better will i ever meet the man reasonable good id like to meet a reasonable man why dont you ask this gardiner to join us for dinner i may be a shutin but i do not lack for news im sorry you had to go through all that no its been a good day better than yours from what ive been told tired and im getting tired of being so tired other than that im doing very well you take care too bobby youre right mr president i dont like feeling sorry for myself nonsense mr president i thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man no she flew up to boston for another charity event shell be sorry to have missed you im afraid so there is no longer any margin for inflation it has gone as far as it can youve reached your limits on taxation dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis and from where i see it mr president the free enterprise system has reached the breaking point we are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible i sympathize with your position mr president i know how difficult it is to be straightforward the reaction to such a speech could be chaos overall pretty good but mr president i think its very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game yes i did mr president id like you to meet my dear friend mr chauncey gardiner im not convinced of that mr president but your visit has raised my spirits mr president how good to see yousure we could really use a farmer wed be grateful for the help also i think you know if you wouldnt mind too terribly a little puppet show every once in a while would do a lot to lift our spirits you know if you wouldnt mind too terribly i know people make mistakes i dont know theres a small community of us we have a place they dont know about were happy well keep trying to figure out a way come stay with us join the struggle you saw it once now you see it again thats life isnt it and you were up here to try the same thing werent you yeah i was going to kill him from the inside

asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the foundation account and he told me about this abduction but i tell you it is preposterous this compulsive dont be fatuous jeffrey little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career lord you can imagine where it goes from here take a look at this sir yes mr lebowski these unfortunate souls can not love in the true sense of the word our mutual acquaintance bunny is one of these i like it too its a male myth about feminists that we hate sex it can be a natural zesty enterprise but unfortunately there are some peopleit is called satyriasis in men nymphomania in womenwho engage in it compulsively and without joy youre not interested in sex sex the physical act of love coitus do you like it do you like sex mr lebowski yes i know about it and i know that you acted as courier and let me tell you something the whole thing stinks to high heaven thank you yes they dont like hearing it and find it difficult to say whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his dick or his rod or his johnson in a sense yes elfranco my robe my art has been commended as being strongly vaginal which bothers some men the word itself makes some men uncomfortable vaginai want to see the sun rise how does it look i dont understand youre hurting me well its in mine too im a pureblood i wasnt turned i was born this way just like you am i evil because i want to survive what about a wolf what about any predator why do you hate us so much if thats true then whyd you save me it doesnt have to be like that we dont have to be enemies why it wouldve been easy for you to let me die back there today but you didnt thank you anyone else make it each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death each day is a little life blade blade weve got six reapers theyre all dead really what are we supposed to do then starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live what about that scumbag you just let off the hook a nothing a drugdealer how do you justify saving people like that hes right about one thing we do have to survive exactly look at the digestive system its been drastically simplified super charged and this ive never seen anything like this the reapers are as different from us as we are from you its almost as if the virus is rewiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones if thats true what about nomak hes been alive longer than the others right so why is he dying he doesnt appear to have any broken bones no entry wounds of any kind whats killing him from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank he was one of the guards nomak attacked minutes i didnt know what about nomak youre hurt what was that we need it sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest tattoos piercings tribal scarring because we regenerate none of its permanent so we have to take it to the next level to remind us were alive this is our world youre entering you may see things feeding just remember why youre here the house of pain what the hell are you doing blade no theyve been training to hunt you two years youre missing the point their vampire victims dont die they turn they become carriers if the reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over do the math survival they tell bedtime stories about you blade the big bad boogieman frankly im disappointed that you were willing to come along so easily i mean without any assurances maybe its better that way were locked in you experimented on your own son nomak said something to blade in greek athelfiki singenia ex amato where did he learn that his name is jared nomaki never imagined id be so happy to see the sun rise its over isnt it yes you will the human side of you is stronger i know it is its the only way you know that well never get out of here alive if you dont i know take some of my blood im not leaving without you it wont work on you is it bad i dont know i woke up just before you did are you all right you make it sound like im already dead im just tired thats all weve been up all night some its been slow my mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart you care about him dont you is he sick i made a trip to the hospital last night borrowed some equipment blade if youre not human then why do you bleed like us ive seen vampire blood you dont have it running through your veins those arent real memories no one has that kind of recall its dark in here what am i injecting you with youre hurt isnt this all a little hightech i thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins what is this place like what so many of them i still cant believe theyre real how can you tell you let him go an hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less this one didnt even talk i know this place its a blood bank graffiti what are you looking at you dont know that look if what you say is true if theres a chance i could turn into one of them then ive got no choice do i i have to work with you i need to learn everything i can about them its the only way ill be able to find a cure for myself you cant do this hes human its murder what are you doing and thats a good thing why in gods name would anyone want to work for them but hes a policeman but he couldve you used me as bait how did you know thats ridiculous no ones that powerful i can go to the police i have blood samples back at the hospital i can show them i cant just leave i have a life here a career and you honestly expect me to believe all this what happens then why youre joking im sorry i but then i remember what an asshole you were and im snapped back to reality sometimes what you havent started in on the internal organs five minutes not a second more and i dont want to hear a word about us i thought you promised to give me some distance curtis its three in the morning im really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes the red blood cells are biconvex which is theoretically impossible theyre hypochromic theres virtually no hemoglobin in them look at the pmns theyre binucleated they should be mononucleated i dont know look at this blood smear this isnt human blood get away from him blade youre a monster but you use blood banks theres no need for any of this your condition can be treated whistler and i were working on a cure when you lamagra what happens then how many of you are there what happened to the power on me yes on blade im not so sure the problem is blade didnt contract the vampire virus from a bite like i did he was born with it the irony is i could probably cure every vampire but him with a retrovirus its injected into the bone marrow cells it causes the hosts dna to mutate theyve been using them to treat sicklecell anemia basically youd have to rewrite the victims dna alter it so that the dna will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin then vampirism is a genetic defect just like hemolytic anemia all right lets start with the basics why do vampires need to drink blood ill take my chances and now youre using blade to exact your revenge how did you escape he killed them why do you hunt them no offense whistler but youre not exactly working with state of the art equipment here you might have missed something what happens if he doesnt take the serum why didnt you tell me the truth about him whistler youve been listening in the whole time so thats it you guys just patch me up and send me on my way so what do you use then a stake who are you people what nick please please i havent done anything my god nick im not a witch youre all crazy closer closer lift the lid and look it hurts my eye is

thï½bes good thank you corbiere see you tomorrow where were weyes horrible he was tired and pale yes i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial yes no never six years no but i can get it for you rebecca lawson i assume his girlfriend i had some papers to pick up a little after eleven because he called me no to show you this its a letter from that lawyer koehler he wrote it to me the day after i saw him hes the one who told me i could get the money if miss lawson went to jail im gon na go to jail i know theyre gon na make it look like i did it they got ta put it on someone what do you think ive got a gun maybe im gon na kill you too maybe ill blow your head off right now yes you take what people say and make it ugly you make others believe what you want them to she should have been found guilty she shouldnt have gotten off no why would i want to kill him no i dont know pm three fifteen dristan nasal spray yes yes yes she talked him into it she wanted everything yes yes yes yes yes no ive been to a few yes ive tried it im a practical woman mr dulaney killing andrew wasnt in my best interest as it is im out of a job and im not in his will i was jealous of course i was hurt he switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with but i didnt kill him yes yes i slept with him but that was a long time ago that bastard who told you that yes i suppose its possible i dont know im not sure i suppose yes he mentioned it he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him that his heart couldnt take it yes it was on a friday i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday it would be october twentyeighth what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial i was at the house one morning i thought miss lawson was upstairs with mr marsh when i went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial yes cocaine no i wasnt lookin through the keyhole if thats what youre thinking id come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to andrew id find their little toys all over the place andrew was a kind and gentle man but he was thirty years older than her wheres the attraction to sleep with someone like that to have the kind of sex they had i really dont know her that well we would say hello to each other when i would come to the house but that was about it i dont know its incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that but if anyone could it would be rebecca he did look i know you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough and well i worked for mr marsh for six years he was a good man until she came alongthere was an inquiry it was his word against mine they believed him i was fired while i was seeing dr paley i mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary three days after i spoke to him in his office he went to the head nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs he laughed and basically said he would decide when it was over yes he did he used to call me tell me that i couldnt just walk out on him he said that if i didnt come back hed make my life miserable i realized he wasnt serious he was seeing other women asking other nurses at the hospital out so i ended it we dated for about a month last year im a nurse i used to work at roseburg memorial hospital dr paleys on staff there yesthats correct but andrew never told me he had a heart condition he said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious no no i havent done it in years i have dont listen to him cant you see hes trying to turn you against me no hes lying shoot him dont push me frank i might lose my temper and send it out just for spite so sue me things have changed i think you should go home and after you leave i see no reason for us to ever have contact again ive been thinking about that ive decided to give it to you after ive collected the inheritance you can take that one if you want but theres another copy thats crazy frank its rebecca i need to see you right away ive got the tape no im a survivor you can think whatever you want frank but i didnt kill andrew and im not going to prison for something i didnt do no youre not i do need you no matter what you think of me i didnt do it i knew you were thinking that i could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom youre wrong frank i need you to believe that youre too weak frank when you want something you have to do what ever it takes to get it if something gets in your way you remove it fuck him he tried to shatter mine to celebrate how masterfully you destroyed roston today are you scared tonight we open new doors sugar or honey dont worry about paley he cant touch me no one can ive thought it all out im sure youll be able to handle him something wrong you can see me now you were brilliant today of course i went out on the boat i dont know frank but dont you think thats something we should find out i dont use cocaine anymore if she says she saw me doing it shes lying it isnt true you have to believe me shes mistaken what theres nothing wrong in admitting that you want me frank no thats what i know you were thinking you and me making love yes it would be nice its hard to let go of a dream isnt it to let go of what you want that seems so far away from who you are now what happened really did you always want to be a lawyer it wont be that hard i hardly know him he wanted me and he couldnt have me sorry andrew loved this old cabin he always dreamed about moving to tahiti living in a hut and becoming a beachbum i could never imagine myself doing that but somehow when he talked about it he made it sound so alive so wonderful soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets leaving the world and its problems behind i wish hed had a chance to do it no not at the office ive got a better idea yes she did hi frank hello not true shall i tell you what you were thinking you were wondering if i was wearing anything under my skirt tastes can change thats not an answer im the photographer what do you think is it against the law why not i know can we get out of here we started talking in fact we talked until four in the morning we discovered we shared a lot of the same interests after that we were together all the time until he left he used to call me every night after he came back then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him ive never left i was at a cocktail party very trendy andrew was in chicago on business he had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling he looked so helpless because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard so did this family down the road i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries it wasnt easy the stone walls were high and id scrape my knees as i climbed over on the other side were wild rose bushes the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down because its beyond intellect its emotion its passion it has to be experienced it cant be imagined i dont know if its something i can explain to you yes i thought the subject was sex something like that have you ever seen animals make love mr dulaney they have such passion such savage emotion they struggle and snarl and claw but neither hurts the other not really i am who i am i cant deny it anymore than you can deny who you are i like sex different i like it wild thats not a crime i loved andrew we made love together we made it differently but we still made love it was our way it was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice if i was some middleaged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me im used to being on the outside looking in the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together andrew hardly needed leading he was a very passionate man he was eager to explore i gave him what he wanted we fulfilled each others needs frank hell file hes an ambitious man ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others and thats exactly what the jury will see when they look at me thats why i need a very good lawyer mr dulaney you must have some feeling some immediate impression a young attractive woman involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will and the things that went on in that house such wild sex what kind of picture does that paint do you think i did it are you going to represent me it didnt get there from me no never six thirty and he was very much alive yes i didnt know that andrew was dead until mr sattler called me at home that nightfrank stop it stop it i dont want our lives ruined because of this i love you frank i want this to work but you have to help me you have to come back from where ever it is you are it was a place to start you used to like to touch me to make love to me why didnt you come to me we cant pretend this isnt happening talk to me maybe it would be a good idea if you just took michael its bad enough that you are its even worse that you can stand here and lie to me youre sleeping with her arent you this isnt a courtroom dont try to turn this around on me why did you lie to me charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you you were with her werent you where have you been thats what i was hoping youd tell me we have to talk is that alright frank no ones asking you not to work i just think you could make some time for your son why dont you talk to him now frank i know youre busy but michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him he wanted to know why you werent talking to him yes she sounds like quite a woman whats she like if he files are you going to take the case how can cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults i swear the both of you some example you set he could let you have your vacation were supposed to go to the lake no it has to be done by tomorrow if you want me to really this is not relaxing youre on vacation remember youre supposed to be relaxing let me go godammit frank let go dont use language like that at the dinner table not even if theyre a dork you should go by and see how hes feeling michael you shouldnt be happy when someone else isnt feeling well thats too badwell i can help i dont mind waiting its a beautiful picture of her maybe its an italian thing their mother was italian not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business my jewish friends grandmother did i simply can not stand that tone you said it in that tone like you were angry at me my brother at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch well why dont i just say black so you can say white dont be surprised to find your brother hasnt changed an iota he hardly ever talks and when he does its in that tone you should have heard him at lunch not two words until the bill came and then he says worth every penny well thats a long time boy it sure has been a long time michael doesnt understand people who make the kind of money my brother makes dont carry money on them they keep it all in various accounts no we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife she told me all the dirt i forgot how interesting things can get around here it was so good to see them the last time we visited they were in europe he is doing so well he ordered champagne for lunch i nearly died carolyn you want these candlesticks i do not need instructions from you to bathe i knew youd do this i knew id come all the way here and be shut out as usual i came to be here for you i didnt have to come lord knows i was never much welcome in this house before apparently dead or alive nothings changed no treasure maps huh how bizarre eeeww i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what ive doneno you can have them aw betty no oh just a old letter from a friend mr peterson are you sure mama wrote all this i know i dont understand it either im sure you havent done anything have some iced tea how are the kids youre right that is sick for over twenty years because thats what i was taught you stick with it normal people dont get divorced i cant remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe for christs sake quite frankly i dont think he ever did and now i find out in between bake sales my mother was anais nin what gets me is im 46 years old ive been in this crummy fucking marriage did we want to was this during betty i never knew that you never dated kathy reynolds i think i better between the book and the coffee im this close to raping the busboy boy all these years ive resented not living the wild life in some place like paris and all the time i couldve moved back to iowa are you drunk you mean she didnt like sex yeah but i thought she died have you called betty maybe you should and do what live alone go back to school find someone else start a magazine for confused woman what if i cant do any of those things oh dont feel sorry for me please no ones forcing me to stay i dont think so not yet anyway and besides something like that doesnt make you a bad person he reminds me of steve in a way steves weak immoral and a liar but hes still a real nice guy he just shouldnt be married at least not to me you getting hungry im hungry oh he did not hes such a nice guy stop it i want to read them if you dont want to then just leave but dont you push me around like im some mule you paid for i already got a husband well id like to read them what are you doing its all there in the three notebooks read them in order if you dont want to i suppose thats okay too but in that case i want you to know something i never stopped loving your father he was a very good man its just that my love for robert was different he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before or since he made me feel like a woman in a way few women maybe more ever experience sshhh after going through the safety deposit box im sure youll find youre way to this letter its hard to write this to my own children i could let this die with the rest of me i suppose but as one gets older one fears subside what becomes more and more important is to be known known for all that you were during this brief stay row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were its easy for a mother to love her children no matter what its something that just happens i dont know if its as simple for children youre all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong but i thought it was important to give you that chance to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was no i dont think so i i cant believe she never told me we spoke at least once a week how could she do that dont say that my lord it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny i dont know im completely in the dark here thats what i get for moving away 82 that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge that would be some trick hes already dead thats what this other letter is from his attorney he left most of his things to mama and requested well he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him she could find him through the national geographic magazine he as a photographer he promises not to write again then all it says is i love you robert going over and over in my mind every detail every moment of our time together and i ask myself what happened to me in madison county i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing were on separate roads but then i look through the lens of my camera and youre there i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you its clear to me now we have been moving towards each other towards those four days all our lives come here a minute michael i remember a mrs delaney but mama told me years ago she died well theres a problem hes not coming i have some sandwich fixings if youre hungry moms ordersno leave it ill do it later listen maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday im sure richardll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all no no i just didnt sleep well im not used to sleeping alone and this heat would you mind i dont know i woke up a little dizzy i didnt sleep well i think i need to lay down madge please somethings happened ive met someone ive fallen in love in a way ive never thought could happen my entire life its our last day together i feel like im going to die when he leaves please help me madge robert if that happens youll have to decide i wont be able to no dont do this i dont know please i want to keep it forever i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life dont you understand well lose it if we leave i cant make an entire life disappear to start a new one all i can do is try to hold onto to both help me help me not lose loving you robert please you dont understand no one does when a woman makes the choice to marry to have children in one way her life begins but in another way it stops you build a life of details you become a mother a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move and when they leave they take your life of details with them and then youre expected move again only you dont remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long not even yourself you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you we are the choices weve made robert no matter how much distance we put between us and this house i bring with it with me and ill feel it every minute were together and ill blame loving you for how much it hurts and then even these four days wont be anything more than something sordid and a mistake youve got to know deep down that the minute we leave here itll all change no they dont say much but carolyns 16 shes just about to find out about all this for herself shes going to fall in love shes going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone if i leave what does that say to her his familys lived for almost a hundred years richard doesnt know how to live anywhere else and the kids for anyone theyll never be able to live through the talk richard will never be able to he doesnt deserve that he hasnt hurt anyone in his life no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind it doesnt seem like the right thing what makes it different robert what does that have to do with it why you wont be made to feel period youve carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time youve touched our lives well go to hell it isnt human not to feel lonely it isnt human not to afraid youre a hypocrite and youre a phony no ones asking you to fine more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time i dont want you to say anything i dont need you to say anything you have no idea what youve done to me do you and after you leave im going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here if anything happened at all and ill have to wonder if you find yourself in some housewifes kitchen in romania if youll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group i know you what can this possibly mean to anyone who doesnt need meaning who goes with the mystery who pretends he isnt scared to death gee i dont know i guess im not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time yes absolutely you have this habit of not needing and that its hard to break i understand of course in that case why sleep you dont need rest or for that matter eat you dont need food to do what be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular i mean what would be the point would you pass the butter well what is this well i just want to know the procedure i dont want to upset your routine do you want any jam well these women friends of yours all over the world how does it work do you see some of them again do you forget others do you write them now and then how do you manage it good more coffee robert i hope you dont mind my asking but i feel like i should sleep all right no long day go to sleep where was she youre right you know we dont have much time just that its been a perfect day and that id like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this what what were your parents like i just wondered why were you trouble what were you like when you were younger but you dont mind why do you say that i bet you could do a book on that one is beautiful look at their expressions as if the camera werent on them at all as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling i sat there once it was hot like today id been shopping i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by where near the doorway or the near the front of the church and arraccinos and zeppolis yes i know it why because im having thoughts i hardly know what to do with i cant seem to stop them i just feel like im getting a little out of control thats all its kind of frightening oh im sorry yes yes tell me about the day you got off the train yes right now tell me someplace youve been someplace on the other side of the world anywhere but here take me somewhere are you hungry no i cant not yet yes thatd be nice sure actually no ive got everything under control id like to clean up myself a bit im going to take a bath dinnerll be ready in about a half hour fine theyre all having a good time how many more shots do you have sorry im late richard called i want you to come i understand thats very kind of you i think hes running for town crier next year oh i guess you got the whole story oh oh hi look im running a little late but ill still yeah see you later no ill drive myself i have a few errands ill meet you there oh sure great wonderful uh the light was fading huhhuh no i was just no yes hi i feel like somethings been spoiled now listen im sorry i i thought we were just having a conversation you seem to be reading all this meaning into it meanings i must be too simple to uh interpret or something what made you ask such a question just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesnt necessarily mean theyre hypnotized just because ive never seen a gazelle stampede doesnt mean im asleep in the world no im just saying but its not the same but no one in particular but how can you just live for what you want what about other people do you ever regret not having a family do you ever regret it the divorce i mean why doesnt it scare you you really dont need anyone woman friends too you must get lonely at times so what happened do you mind if i ask you why you got divorced what yes what no ill do them later umm i dont know i can look it up what no im all right its working when smells like dirt you drink bug repellent well its kind of buggy out there my god how id love to see that no its all right i just meant it might be a little dull for you telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere i dont know ive never thought about it what was the most exciting place youve ever been to unless youre tired of talking about it my children and richard didnt like my working id like to think so i know one of them went on to medical school i didnt mean that the way it sounded i dont think youre normal you sound like an artist why do you think making pictures i like that you really love what you do dont you you ought to write these stories down oh you then what happened oh my god youre blushing what okay help cook would you like to stay for dinner there arent many choices in town and anyway youd have to eat alone so would i but i we dont even know each other i feel so embarrassed i think so much yes very clean no i mean yes hes clean but hes also other things hes a very hard worker very honest very caring gentle good father hes very clean richard was in the army i met him while i was living in naples i didnt know where iowa was i only cared that it was america and of course being with richard why i guess except im one of the people it frightens oh michaels 17 and carolyns 16 about a year and a half my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair my

violet and i wont quit on you im still here were almost there violet just hang on listen if he doesnt run all you have to do is break down go to your bedroom and pack some things start crying saying you love him but you cant do it youre sorry but you have to leave and just walk out that means he probably will kill johnnie its all right violet its working all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does thats okay as long as he believes it was johnnie what happened i think were going to find out i had a partner and she fucked me every job like this has moments where things dont go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass its in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart thank you youll be clean and well be rich hell have to run if its real enough hell believe it because deep down hell want to because of what you are going to tell him you have to make it as real as you can the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand you will be covered and that moment is the most important moment in the plan not caesar the same way ill know that you went to scotch trust there is no going back if he does trust me violet he wont an accident and as you do the bottle will slip from your hands and shatter against the hardwood floor waiting in the apartment next door we want him to come down to relax feel in control again fine any bodyguards what time did you say they would be there what did gino drink its getting better and better keep going has caesar ever seen him does johnnie hit on you what happened gino marzzone is coming to your apartment its a big deal isnt it that means caesar will be ready he doesnt want to look like an idiot gino has been there before sweet jesus and johnnie is his son thats johnnie marzzone gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money shit marzzone as in angelo marzzone head of the marzzone family who is gino why it sounded like he and caesar dont like each other all right now tell me about johnnie good does the case lock and where is it now what then what exactly you said he washed the money i think the difference is i can have sex with someone i just met someone i hardly know but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself im just making a point you have no idea what youre asking how much trust two people need to do something like this all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected someone like me i didnt say that but since you did lets say that you are it would have been easy to set shelly up you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment all right lets say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying i am but these people are serious violet if you want to know how serious ask shelly theyre worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules you fuck them youve got to do it right wait a minute wait a minute do you have any idea what you are saying you are asking me to help you fuck the mob how much money what choice for what mickey sounds like he wanted to get caught he was in love with you right even though he knew about you i think so too i suppose he just wants to watch dont tell me youre a workaholic what about that guy this morning what was it then what the fuck was it for christs sake violet i heard you thin walls remember what are you saying that you dont have sex with men is that what her daddy tells her let me guess this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside that inside you there is a little dyke just like me how can you sit in that bed and say that i know you cant understand because were different violet were different im not afraid of anything if there is one thing i cant stand about sleeping with women its all the fucking mind reading shit here we go nothing so am i i guess i wanted to my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught she was always more honest than me thats what i tell someone when im trying to get them in my bed isnt that what you wanted to know what i did time for the redistribution of wealth five years is a long time how long have you been with him hes a launderer how did you meet him

everyone will assume he took the money c shit im sorry why i still dont see how im going to get clean with the money in the apartment everyone will think i did it when i get the scotch how do i know you wont take off im just asking what if you cant know for certain that he wont see you what if he sees you shit oh shit where will you be poor boy has to work so hard gino travels with a big man named roy caesar calls him the driver the plane is in at seven so id say about eight scotch glenlivet i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it gino doesnt know english or at least he pretends he doesnt so he doesnt talk much he gets right to the point both times they talked for about five minutes had one drink and then they left he does it right in front of him johnnie hits on anything in high heels not much really caesar was nervous kept cleaning the apartment the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear yeah twice yeah yeah thats his brother gino marzzone it started way before i was around i think basically its because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father like each other they hate each other johnnie yes its in a case on his desk in his office i saw it this morning to let it dry he hung it up yeah do you think you know me like that is that what you think you think im lying thats why i need your help you said you were good caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through shellys books to figure out how he did it shelly said it was over two million dollars caesar is going to get the money and bring if those quarters fell to the floor would you still reach up to that cash register you made a choice once do you think you would make that same choice again i want out i want a new life i see what ive been waiting for but i need you corky hes the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be but mickey doesnt like it like they do i suppose thats why hes good at it caesar lives for these moments he tells me its just the business but i know its more than that he likes it the violence ill catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars he says they remind him who he his theyre all like that except maybe mickey maybe he did he would brag to me all the time he was never afraid of caesar because he didnt know him not like i do for shelly taking the money was a way to take from caesar he could have run at any time but he didnt because he didnt want out thats what he told himself but it wasnt even about me it was about caesar he wanted what caesar had thats how they are i understand them yes shelly was skimming from the business he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him fuck it i think you better leave no shelly knows what i am he saw me in a bar with another woman you mean shelly we make our own choices and we pay our own prices i think were more alike than you want to admit work all my life everyone has been telling me that when i have sex im not really having sex not real sex but theyre wrong i know what is and isnt sex and what you heard was definitely not sex what you heard wasnt sex i dont i know what i am i dont need to have it tattooed on my shoulder oh no shes nothing like you shes a lot smarter than you because its the truth were not that different corky i

your fault the walls here are just so thin yeah see im kind of a night person so i was wondering if it wasnt a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools my pleasure but

pity because theyre wonderful ive seen them all but you shouldnt have gone and changed your name you should have kept your own he wasnt crazy in the beginning i was upset i think i really hated him

have the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was there arent any personal lives for people like us he made that very clear to me nine years ago if id thought of my life with charles as a personal life id have left him then why should anyone vote for him hes made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them children to be told one thing one day something else the next as the whim seizes him and theyre supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars im surprised he got the votes he did im

papers gentlemen of the enquirer this has i think been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists mr reilly in particular who are the latest additions to our ranks it will make them happy to learn that the enquirers circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark i know youre right mr bernstein look at that lets hope they like it there thesell be kept ill provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly i will also provide them ill write it myself my declaration of principles dont smile brad take dictation mr bernstein its a saying mr bernstein a new broom sweeps clean ready for dinner brad refigure it mr bernstein at two cents two cents ive just made a shocking discovery the enquirer is without a telephone have two installed at once get me a typewriter ill finish the notice it isnt here mr bernstein im dictating it of her acting it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low have you got that mr bernstein in the opinion of this reviewer go on thais what does it say there thats all right mr bernstein where is he i rather like it myself send it right away thats all right we have no secrets from our readers mr thatcher is one of our most devoted readers mr bernstein he knows whats wrong with every issue since ive taken charge whats the cable mr bernstein mr thatcher it is accepted mr carter with assurances of my deepest regard thatll be all today mr carter youve been most understanding good day mr carter thats the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on mr carter right now i wish youd send your best man up to see mr silverstone have him tell mr silverstone if he doesnt produce his wife at once the enquirer will have him arrested have him tell mr silverstone hes a detective from the central office if mr silverstone asks to see his badge your man is to get indignant and call mr silverstone an anarchist loudly so that the neighbors can hear the chronicle doesnt say shes murdered mr carter it says the neighbors are getting suspicious if the headline is big enough it makes the new big enough the murder of mrs harry silverstone im still hungry brad lets go to rectors and get something decent the chronicle has a twocolumn headline mr carter why havent we im not criticizing mr carter but heres what i mean theres a front page story in the chronicle and a picture of a woman in brooklyn who is missing probably murdered a mrs harry silverstone why didnt the enquirer have that this morning thats one of the things i think must be changed mr

i cant imagine how mrs kane came to make such a silly mistake the sedative dr wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle i suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her too late for what too late for you and this this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me well you wont do it i tell you you wont do it go on get out i can fight this thing all alone theres only one person in the world to decide what im going to do and thats me and if you think if any of you think no oh yes there is i suppose so but im not afraid of the story you

people of this state can decide which one of us to trust if you want to know theyve already decided the election tuesdayll be only im going to be elected governor and the first thing im going to do in case you dont know emily this this gentleman is im much obliged mr president for your concern about me however i happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the united states and i say that if this lease goes through the property of the people of the united states goes into the hands of thanks its the only vein i know i tell the facts the way i see them and any man that knows that facts im not suggesting anything mr president ive come here to tell you that unless some action is taken promptly and you are the only one who can take it the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks you cant if youre interested in what people say signor matisti i may be able to enlighten you a bit the newspapers for instance im an authority on what the papers will say signor matisti because i own eight of them between here and san francisco its all right dear signor matisti is going to listen to reason arent you maestro your job isnt to give mrs kane your opinion of her talents youre supposed to train her voice nothing more youre right we did lose a million dollars last year on the other hand i am the publisher of the enquirer as such it is my duty ill let you in on a little secret it is also my pleasure to see to it that decent hardworking people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money mad pirates because god help them they have no one to look after their interests ill let you in on another little secret mr thatcher i think im the man to do it you see i have money and property as charles foster kane who has eighty two thousand six hundred and thirtyone shares of metropolitan transfer you see i do have a rough idea of my holdings i sympathize with you charles foster kane is a dangerous scoundrel his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him you may if you can form such a committee put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars the trouble is mr thatcher you dont realize youre talking to two people mr thatcher isnt everything ive been saying in the enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true wont you step into my office mr thatcher i think well have to send our friend wheeler a cable mr bernstein of course well have to make it shorter than his because hes working on an expense account and were not let me see mike can you prove it isnt i dont know how to run a newspaper mr thatcher i just try everything i can think of wherem i going you goin mom i didnt used to be afraid of it he was dead thats a poem do you know what it means persia it belonged to a king do you know what that is not my wife not either of them mrs kane liked poetry do you like poetry raymond raymond lock it and keep it locked close the door raymond is mrs kane all right get dr corey hello brad well youve been getting a pretty low salary here in new york it seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our chicago paper should get what hes worth you still want to be transferred to the other paper hey brad ive been analyzed an awful lot tonight lets have another brandy she can leave me as a matter of fact ive already left her dont worry brad ill live its simpler than that brad a society girl cant stand the gaff thats all other things are important to her social position what theyre saying on the front porches at southampton is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner nothing if she dosent love me youre not going to like it in chicago they wind comes howling in from the lake and theres practically no opera season at all and the lord only knows whether theyve ever heard of lobster newburg are you finished the personal note is all there is to it its all there ever is to it its all there every is to anything stupidity in our government complacency and selfsatisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong you cant fight those things impersonally theyre not impersonal crimes against people theyre being done by actual persons with actual names and positions and the right of the american people to own their own country is not an academic issue brad that you debate and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers do you think the enquirer shouldnt have campaigned against the oil leases why is she leaving me brad you are drunk i dont think so brad weve just had word that the president is out of danger it seems i didnt kill him after all all right ill tell you what ill do brad ill get drunk too maybe thatll help why brad thats just a little promotion scheme nobody expects you mike will you try and get mr leland some coffee ill get you some coffee whats wrong brad go ahead ive got to think of emily i dont have to i run a newspaper with half a million readers and theyre getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast i cant help that besides they all know im married to his niece ive got to think of her what lesson not to expose fraud when i see it not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property run it the way i said reilly this afternoon a great man was assassinated oil belonging to the people of the united states was leased out for a song to a gang of highpressure crooks nobody can blame me because theyre true everything i said witholding that veto was treason i said treason was a capital offense punishable by death because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the enquirer in his pocket what do you mean by that why not yes take dictation front page editorial this afternoon a great man was assassinated he was the president of the united states youre wrong it does make a difference to you rectors brad come to think of it i dont blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent you wont miss anything it isnt much of a war besides they tell me there isnt a decent restaurant on the whole island yes you start tomorrow night richard carl in the spring chicken ill get us some girls you get tickets a drama critic gets them free you know rectors at seven you dont want to be a war correspondent how about being a dramatic critic i mean ive got a job for you say brad ive got an idea and i do it because they do it and they do it its a vicious circle isnt it im going over to georgies brad you know georgie dont you how would the enquirer look with no news about this nonexistent war with benton pulitzer and heart devoting twenty columns a day to it all right brad all right you dont have to be a war correspondent unless you want to id want to hello georgie itll be our first foreign war in fifty years brad well cover it the way the hickville gazette covers the church social the names of everybody there what they wore what they ate who won the prizes who gave the prizes i tell you brad i envy you by bradford leland the enquirers special correspondent at the front im almost tempted well gentlemen are we going to war its a good idea for a newspaper four hundred sixy thousand people are going to know whos responsible and theyre going to get the news the true news quickly and simply and entertainingly and no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news ive changed the front page a little mr bernstein thats not enough theres something ive got to get into this paper besides pictures and print ive got to make the new york enquirer as important to new york as the gas in that light a wasted day tired what makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid something inflexible that people are supposed to pay two cents for i think its beginning to dawn on mr rogers that i mean what i say with mr rogers out of the way reilly i think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state well mr bernstein it does seem too good to be true doesnt it mr bernstein oh yes the bonus what check well withdraw support completely anything else what do you mean by thatthats what you think is it jim you wont be lonely charles mr thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight charles youll be leaving on number ten it is go on mr thatcher its going to be done exactly the way ive told mr thatcher ill sign those papers this is mr thatcher charles where do i sign mr thatcher i want you to stop all this nonsense jim i want you to stop all this nonsense jimlets not start all over again charlie weve said everything that can be said goodbye charlie you cant stop me and left of course theyll hear im not saying goodbye except to you but i never imagined that people wouldnt know yes im going to leave you dont tell me youre sorry youll never have another chance to hit me again i never knew

to love you well im not going to stop it im going to say exactly what i think youve never given me anything youve tried to buy me into giving you something youre its like you were bribing me thats what its been from the first moment i met you no matter how much it cost you your time your money thats what youve done with everybody youve ever known tried to bribe them oh i dont mean the things youve given me that dont mean anything to you whats the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue youre going to keep crated up and never look at its only money it doesnt mean anything youre not really giving anything that belongs to you that you care about what you want me to want you mean what youve decided i ought to have what youd want if you were me but youve never given me anything that ill discuss whats on my mind when i want to youre not going to keep on running my life the way you want it im not just your wife im a person all by myself or i ought to be i was once sometimes you get me to believing i never was oh im sick and tired of you telling me what i must and what i musnt do im not going to have my guests insulted just because you think if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic thats their business youve got no right i mean it oh i know i always say i mean it and then i dont or you get me so i dont do what i say im going to but invite everybody order everybody you mean and make them sleep in tents who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own with their own bath where they know where everything is its not a habit i do it because i like it it makes a whole lot more sense than collecting venuses cant we go back charlie hurray for the bulldog half past eleven the shows have just let out people are going to night clubs and restaurants of course were different we live in a palace at the end of the world at night i mean in new york charlie i said what time is it i couldnt make you see how i felt charlie i just couldnt i couldnt go threw with singing again you dont know what it means to feel to know that people that an audience dont want you that if you havent

emergency do you have an agent lowry in your new york office i need to speak with an agent lowry go to the northeast corner call a cab bring the pizza then theres a poem roses are red violets are blue

you a second when im ready to compare notes ill let you know jonas agent lowry no not yet i was just thinking that i dont know didnt see him you dont understand wait tell me about iti dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology is it possible yes sir yes sir thank you what would you have me say david good luck david this seemed best maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account you what im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request itll just take a moment do you have a minute david you mean what is it whats happened ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa are you threatening me im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad with me what why rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise could it be a nested code of some sort its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention david goddamnit they are out there david the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening meaning you cant just pull the plug david its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi no doubt presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now really congratulations by the way oh hows he doing pepsi tequila then disagree but dont stand in my way what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks youre dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there im willing to take that risk well yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind because you cut it from the budget three years running it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica how can that be and what maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles a third layer what dr lunacharsky hows the spying tonight guys i scanned it at arecibo negative results always put it on speakers im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes vb10s an m dwarf signa draconis too old j39 z186 i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot its a civilian facility okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something its beautiful this is how you see the sky nice where ellie pulsar dr cullers because i cant but i dont believe it to be the truth is it possible yes but by our standards yes i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right there is no direct evidence no i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own pardon me but you cant do and a hundred mile airspace which well also need the networks help to receive and decode you want to classify prime numbers this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans no please please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean no i mean why so soon so what happens now all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it the librarian or the library can you help us so we passed some kind of test the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here so who and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others why did you contact us can you show me so who what are you but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin youre not real none of this is dad but tell me how did i mean how can i used i used to dream you were alive and then id wake up and lose you all over again okay pensacola okay okay there could we hear god could we hear to the moon could we hear to china but what do i say i cant move any smaller why dont you come back with me of hadden industries the systems integration site the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us you sound like joseph you think the world ends with the millennium what are you talking about its over it looks like pixie dust kent wouldve given anything to see this david too whats that its so small mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment and in return a machine but a machine that does what some kind of circuitry youre saying there is no separate primer in the message because its on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is a pagebreak signal a period if i knew you any better id say that doesnt sound like you youve found it what could i possibly have that you would want mr hadden i didnt realize i was out what kind of deal why am i here mr hadden you live here sr hadden you compromised our security codes youre implying that the whole selection process is a sham i thought you were here because you want to go id say this is slightly different weve just lived through a century of incredible violence and self destruction do you call it interventionist when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck but the machine worked thats what ive been trying to tell everyone the tape its all there if theyd just look at the tape peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane how long was i gone peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this wait hold on a minute im im fine like it almost there that you valerian someone tell me this is really happening you too peter you sonofabitch im serious about this peter right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married please youre just as ambitious as i am more but the work but what about your research greenbank we could be together again peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could the vla its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you is indistinguishable from magic its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too i read your paper on etis its brilliant sounds like a russian general ellie arroway hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning in other words god works in mysterious ways but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true but its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real i dont have any proof palmer youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small they dont believe me so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you im assuming you read my deposition hi and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please i cant hear this now i dont know dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow please please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now i cant do this im sorry i cant im sorry i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow thank you the final countdown i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know how do you mean another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves its late we should go back its getting late i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy i read your book its what my whole lifes been aimed at the only thing thats given it a sense of purpose if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt something like that if you came back in other words its too elegant the degree of economy is extraordinary its really the next logical step even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature dna outclasses any computer we can come up with the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable i dont think so not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors so is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this yes very much i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it can you try thats not doubt thats four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time i flinched and mind yes what are you thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small well its been a while but i dont recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations what about you doesnt all of this shake your faith at all i guess i wouldve felt sorry for the universe id say logic more than faith the odds were on my side champagne please and where exactly does that put your position for managing the truth but the truth wont be managed sir it stops being the truth the moment you try i guess id say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason you kill me you really do the first truly global apolitical event in history and you cant wait to spin it yknow what fine i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are theres no quicker way to show them call it xenophobic paranoia dont you see the absolute absurdity of this this isnt about them its about us our violence our fear and mistrust i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed basically announcing our intentions are hostilelaugh

murders the same as the first time he took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong he was not acting on mad impulse he was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears daryll lee told me that joan of arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear i thought he was lying he was lying the test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects yes without question in jail how was conrad supposed to find kurten where did you

people like me write about them we give them a kind of immortality they get thousands of letters ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month theyre like film stars its not chronological son of sam was before hillside they werent going to show it to me the arrogance its my life what i cant believe is that in an earlier life i slept with him christ any god that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button just give me a minute here the letter is addressed to me you dont feel fear do you youre young you feel like youll live forever how wonderful they put merry saks on it look in the crowd he liked to hang around and watch the cops at work one of those goddamned car alarms whats going whats that music its abba i can hear it its abba

first one ive felt personally terrified of hes something new and unheard of i dont know what he wants whos going to catch him you and if you do therell be another one and one after that ah if you knew that youd be half way to nailing him serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive this guy has a plan all thought out flexible and complex hes playing a game with us who will he imitate next maybe hes doing all the serial killers in history the great innovators the murderers hall of fame just to prove hes better than all of them they got caught he didnt its what bianchi and buono injected into one of their victims consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds tell them to test for the chemicals found in windex thats a product for cleaning with is that it there were needle marks but no drugs in her blood please thank inspector goetz for taking care of me last night ruben that little winona ryder manner youre more convincing as clint eastwood have you got a warrant get the hell out o here this is the only space i have left in the world why cant you leave me out of it i turned it off its like an open window he can climb right in youre saying its the same man but hes changed his style that doesnt happen these men are robotic the murder is like a ritual the method itself is part of the pleasure then what do you need me for thats no surprise hes going home he slept over because i was a little anxious because im his damned pinup girl his all of them they know me theyre in prisons with libraries they collect clippings im their worthy opponent you keep my name out of this its anybody connected to author ity they write they even knock on your door theyre fans it thrills them to flirt with getting caught she probably let him in the door without a thought where are their mothers where are the mothers that are supposed to teach them to be wary and to tough and not afraid to fight maybe thats why you cant catch him i know what she looks like the redheaded woman in my computer i am not going to look at any more pictures theyre like a disease they get into my head i cant get them out show what its gone he wrote a self destruct virus into the code so it would only play until we try to copy it then it erased itself gone do you remember what you saw one officer already got killed trying to protect me please just take it all away leave me alone its too big a file to copy to a disk look at the bottom of the screen you see the icon with the arrow pointing left click on that twice if you knew why you might know where to look for him i dont envy you this hes not done hes going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush now ive done what you asked me i sent andy out on murder missions for gods sake its the boston strangler alber desalvo he used their own stockings to strangle them tied in a bowknot where are the stockings he strangled them with the bodies have been carefully arranged different positions but somehow the same the positions are brutal yet quite artful its like a signature hes proud of his accomplishments there are early picassos and late picassos but you always recognize the hand he wants us to recognize his hand ive seen this hand before what are you hiding he felt remorse he covered her it was a lover or a husband someone close somebody who knew her and cared about her is it an ongoing case will you go andy make them go inspector halloran that is so much bullshit you dont like or admire me but the beautiful part is i dont give a fuck thats the upside of having a breakdown oh my god no im a clinical hysteric with panic syndrome and anxiety neurosis agoraphobic im afraid of everything real and imaginary i never leave this apartment now nobody ever comes here i just wanted to get your attention i write and i used to lecture on these crimes but im not competent well lets thank god you and inspector goetz are on the case then yes i did poor impulse control the accounts of the firs two murders made it so clear they were the work of the same man but you kept announcing they were unrelated youll never catch him that way you dont admire me no police admire me i got one of you killed why dont you say right out what youre here for what calls i havent made any calls if hes not out why are they here is he out i think this is number three youre calling me a crank who is this what else they taught me

going to fall well another time then ill be all right hes not going to attack me what i m rally afraid of is all in my own head ruben are you always so bold you and maryjane arent lovers that would be much appreciated thanks maryjane you think that logic and police procedure order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night i did once but you know how hell get caught hell have an accident or some cop will get lucky you cant catch him by being intelligent and working hard or the worst there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way month after month the news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows and hurry home before dark and then one day there are no more what happened did he just stop get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more did he kill himself did he die in an auto accident or a fight or get sick and die its like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth and you never know but you keep asking yourself when you read about a new murder is he back i know halloran whats the rest of it hes brilliant this one is brilliant its gone the files not here what did you do its a game they like to play berkowitz son of sam hung around the crime scene talking to the cops this ones probably watching you laughing at you he can get into my computer any time he likes this is exactly the kind of thing i didnt want to have happen that computers wired into internet in the sixties hes dead stabbed to death in prison somebody is imitating his

job condescending bastard helen on your lists to call is san quentin daryll lee cullum they get fan letters its also the major piece of evidence and it makes you a key part of his plan you cant run away from it anymore look at the order hes doing them he did three as the boston strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work then he did one like the hillside strang ler and then one as son of sam to lead us on to where and what end and hes doing more than that hes imitating each killers method as closely as he can in details injecting windex using 44 playing abba i put my ass on

that clint is putting a guard on you but if you swear to leave the computer on winona will assign him to the hall outside helen the killer directly contacted you his interest in you is intense im worried about you i dont want to lose you i know this stirs up every monster under the bed but this is the only direct contact we have with him the only chance we have to trap him so you can turn internet back on or i do and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick scream and hyperventilate he comes in the window we maybe grab him wheres the onswitch who turned off the internet

had much practice as a child in the west a platoon lived with us theyd let me play with their weapons the scabbard is so beautiful its heavy for such a thin piece of metal the antidote exists she

well find a solution go back to them first then you can decide about lo look at the trouble youve caused now you know what giang hu life is really like if you think of me as your sister let me give you some sisterly advice you can run from marriage but not your parents ill give them to you here you must be in proper attire yes from the west he went undercover and and followed her here then as a sister let me wish you happiness in your marriage i am not an aristocrat as you are but i must still respect a womans duties his name was meng si zhao he was a brother to li mu bai by oath one day while in battle he was killed by the sword of li mu bais enemy after li mu bai and i went through a lot together our feelings for each other grew stronger but how could we dishonor mengs memory so the freedom you talk about i too desire it but i have never tasted it yes did you know i was once engaged to be married do you think so let me tell you a story you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family thank you for seeing me i hear your wedding day is near you must be overwhelmed by the preparations you write gracefully calligraphy is so similar to fencing youre doing calligraphy how so youre probably right what do you think so i heard congratulations its the most important step in a womans life isnt it sure no place to bathe for days sleeping in fleainfested beds they tell you all about that in those books writers wouldnt sell many books if they told how it really is fighters have rules too friendship trust integrity without rules we wouldnt survive for long yes i am but i prefer the machete certain moves however call for a sword youre too young to understand my friend li mu bai hes given it to sir te as a gift beautiful but dangerous once you see it tainted with blood its beauty is hard to admire its 400 years old the handle is heavy and the blade is no ordinary metal still the sword is the lightest of weapons youre just not used to handling it use it to meditate free yourself from this world as you have been taught let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath do not waste it for me save your strength mu bai hold on give me some hope that cant be everything has an antithesis why not this we followed jade fox what happened not a bad idea tonight well get a good nights sleep at headquarters what about you to repress ones feelings only makes them stronger not everything is an illusion my hand wasnt that real dont you want to see her again you think jade fox will show up i wish there were something more i could do to help you its not our affair even if wudan accepts her her husband might object but wudan does not accept women shes an aristocrats daughter shes not one of us in any case it will all be over soon youll kill fox and shell marry i knew she would intrigue you my job was to get the sword back without embarassing anyone i wasnt about to ruin her life or her fathers but its not your sword anymore you gave it to sir te then why did you come what do you mean didnt you come back here for it no id already sent them home you can blame me for losing the sword but please trust that ill get it back soon using my own methods no not yet it was bo sir tes man i hear he followed the thief to the yus no be careful sir te requires discretion official business is difficult enough dont let personal feelings make it worse and i dont know even this poster could be some sort of trap is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu you always suspected shed fled to the west but something is going on at the yu household join me once you have finished i can wait for you in peking come with me to peking you can give the sword to sir te yourself itll be just like old times so what will you do now you use it justly youre worthy of it i dont understand how can you part with it it has always been with you the green destiny sword youre giving it to sir te were preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking what was it you were enlightened why youre a wudan fighter training is everything the mountain must be so peaceful i envy you my work keeps me so busy i hardly get any rest monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain he said you were practicing deep meditation good and how are you mu baiits been too long i doubt it this thief it very unusual yes the very killer of li mu bais own master last night she killed a policeman who had tracked her down no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking sir te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes that can bring ruin to themselves and their families we know who stole the missing item if the thief returns it im sure sir te will pursue the matter no further im sorry shes not feeling well enough to receive you today the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs sir te can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter we must be careful governor yu is a court official and in charge of security any disturbance will cast suspicion on him it might get sir te in trouble but the sword could be in his compound has governor yu ever seen the sword i beg your pardon li mu bai and i arent cowards i dont know please sir te what is it youve always been so good to li mu bai and me please accept our thanks sir te it has brought him as much trouble as glory help him to leave these troubles behind otherwise hell never be

control my arms keep getting really hairy what the hell is the tampon test i dont know much about him how do you know if a guy is decent i dont think ive ever actually liked anyone ive dated before peter even likes me without makeup im sorry i didnt want you to think i was still a doormat um he stopped by yesterday before you came over i wonder if hes married he was cute huh of course whenever i meet a guy im wearing no makeup no mark wears boxers they must have been in the dryer already my vision got worse again and my bra finally fits again i think i went in and fell asleep i guess gregory walked home and got killed i blacked out he was trying to get into my apartment and i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on i grabbed him and kissed him i couldnt stop eating steak i felt out of control like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian i couldnt get enough and then gregory walked me home and he peed in front of me i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory i dont remember we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period alone no i dont think so did i kill him of course not why would they exaggerate and he was ripped limb from limb hes dead am i bad luck or what oh my glasses maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them holy shit im a freak where where do you think a mustache would be look i never thought of it like that i never know what to do on dates do guys still pay maybe they have to pee youre so lucky you have george and dont need to go on dates anymore why did gregory ask me out i mean hes cute he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea george bit you i think she broke the skin even on sale that stuffs a fortune i worked all week to pay for a bra can you believe she fuckin bit me where

front door we he walked me home and we said goodnight um he kissed me goodnight and that was it cause im a fucking werewolf we didnt have sex i dont know i dont remember doing it i ate a guy last night i think im a werewolf that im a doormat of course the shrink makes more notes no hes not hes a courier he picks up packages from the airport no i have a cat no we left the restaurant and and i felt sick so so i took a cab home alone what makes you think i was the last one yes jennifer told me what does that have to do with me no take it no i said it was our first date no it was our first date yes i we had dinner oh my god what happenedsure see ya oh thank god maybe this whole thing is really over frida you okay sorry i shouldnt go on about myself at a time like this are you sure youre going to be okay we were i was just so tempted it was sort of a test i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george but now george knows about benito and he doesnt want to be with me no hes the guy im having an affair with about benito i think george knows no i wont let you do that i guess youll find out remember what madame sconce said if you love him hell be fine youll get through this you were fine for over three weeks you scared the shit out of me i thought you were killing yourself fall in love what choice do we have the weird thing is he shot her with a silver bullet she died at age 34 in the 1800s they thought she was crazy she was banished from her town seems her husband shot her the femalecycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves see i knew you never loved mark this is from a scientist in france madame sconce the original werewolves were females they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the womans cycle my suspicion is that the only cure is true love check out what i found we dont know youre a werewolf it might never happen again you have to get on with your life maybe you should go out with him if you keep avoiding him hell get suspicious besides what better way to not get busted than to date the cop whos investigating you symptoms include loss of emotional control compulsive behavior cravings crying spells so are you look go about your life act like nothings wrong well get to the bottom of this lets do some research ill check the libraries you surf the web does that mean this whole thing is over well if he does he didnt give you away he must really like you hide him tell them youll meet them outside ignore it you expecting someone at least i finally saw the reason you couldnt get over mark okay lets say that this is pms related you think those male cops are going to understand that youll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin we have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves if you ask me the fucker got what he deserved im glad hes dead why the fuck would you do that you say murder but you have no idea what happened you dont remember doing it so its out of your control how could i im helping you clean up marks remains and you ask how could i cheat on george theres kind of this guy im seeing first of all youre my alibi i told george i was with you last night dont call the police what happened to his tooth hes been here all night did you get rid of mark im stopping by later im worried about you bye get rid of him relax carlton was torn apart no way could you have done that maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out or and he was missing an arm frida carltons dead tuesday are you okay frida i was worried to death about you ive called you for two days where have you been frida listen to yourself if i said i was a werewolf would you believe me maybe the blood was from your period like before youre delusional maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip so you tasted blood and the severed arm well i dont see it and maybe this is all in your head youre a pms werewolf of course frida are you on drugs and what makes you think you killed a man so wheres this infamous arm now frida youre not making sense i cant come over right now you fucked carlton see i told you he liked you frida this is a bad time were having sex and george actually answered the phone its just cause mine is finer a little bleachll fix that no theyre not geez i wish id get it like that you might want to tape your nipples down next time its really distracting i still thought it was a purse charming carlton i think he called you beautiful well whatever it was seems to have worked cause you look great great george is meeting carlton first for drinks we can meet and go together itll be a blast no he didnt come on i dont want to be alone with those two all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me hey carltons in town come out with the three of us frida this hair thing is all in your head youre using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone howd it go with the cop you have to stop being so self critical frida youre at his place and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say im so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons if he says no hes too embarrassed then you know hes a wus if he says hes got some in the bathroom then you know there are other women around a lot but if he says yes and goes to get you tampons well then hes a decent guy then while hes out give him the tampon test hmmm sounds suspicious frida im your friend im not judging you you didnt sleep with the creep did you why didnt you tell me you said you hadnt seen him for a month gross so this is marks flesh when did you see him he wasnt wearing a ring but you dont want to date a cop frida theyre so blue collar rule one always wear makeup uh huh good thing those cops didnt see that are those marks i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses at least your pms is over and then what why the hell did he do that i guess youre off that vegetarian kick youve been on for ten years did you get smashed or what you have to eat if youre drinking and not just those little salads you dont think so you either did or your didnt no did you fuck him so did you do it to sound like big macho cops he was probably just found with a knife in his back im sure they were exaggerating there you go blaming yourself for everything again hey did you get contacts you are not frida we all have a little hair there i didnt even notice till you showed me we can bleach that its no big deal i dont see anything maybe just a little where they better of course trouble is you never know what theyll expect for it you got ta know what to order and what youre willing to do like if a guy spends a fortune on you hes gon na feel like you owe him something are you kidding he might as well say can i date rape you what i really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment can i use your phone how about a nightcap i want to meet your cat and my alltime favorite the old standby i have to use your bathroom maybe he likes you ever think of that its good for you to go out get your mind off mark i kind of asked him to we were you know he got a little carried away what a bitch you should see a doctor that can be dangerous george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room and she got the medium frida grab that red one theres a sale its such a nice place classical music relaxing atmosphere you deserve to pamper yourself come on it cant hurt its not about him seeing you in it its how you feel youll feel sexy in lingerie and itll show its an inner thing okay just one more stop and youll be all set victorias secret or if your boyfriends an asshole try to get through dinner without them you have beautiful eyes cant you get contacts do you really need these how about i give you a makeover youll feel better about yourself youre actually pretty youre just not bringing it out i get a little bloated sometimes frida i dont mean this as a criticism but you might not want to talk about pms around men maybe hes just shy people notice you frida so dont look in his eyes every woman at some point has to date a musician i wish youd get rid of mark for good every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out your shrink always gives you bad advice he only hears what you choose to tell him marks an asshole he cheated he borrowed money and never paid it back hes never had a regular job anythings better than mark well thats not going to happen tonight george said carltons a nice guy come on weve been double dating since the fourth grade shes my best friend i got ta be there for her no matter how crazy it sounds ive been in some bad relationships and shes been there for me shes lonely if pretending shes a werewolf helps then more power to her take some allergy medicine dont be stupid george obviously if shes a werewolf she cant be around a cat she might eat it and besides cats are afraid of wolves its so bad she becomes a werewolf tell her im eating so now being with frida is lucky i thought you said she was a flake i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along shes just insecure once you get to know her shes fabulous come on ive been working with frida carlton wont even recognize her now shes really coming out of her shell yeah and when were mad at each other were out of sync it only works if youre on good terms so i asked the bartender what coyote ugly meant its like the bagger system you know a two bagger someone so ugly that you need two bags one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off or a threebagger see he was cheating from the get go i dont know i guess the outfits are cool and i want a big gun i was thinking about becoming a cop myself do you take a test or something or just sign up you want her sheets how the hell is that your business jesus christ she got her period relax guys it happensits okay if you are we just want to know i dont want to be expecting grandchildren if you havent mentioned dating anyone since mark and well youre not a lesbian are you were worried about you 60 minutes was on samesex couples no its momyes sir everything wont

you dont like that you dont know how to play him he doesnt follow the same rules of politics you do that makes him dangerous does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken and not some veronica lake lookalike who fucks for money i see him because he doesnt know how to disguise who he is theres more if you want to hear it i see bud because i want to i see bud because he cant hide the warmth he has inside him you want to know what buds like in bed the silver screens loss is your gain oh the best i ever had absolutely the best

this house and be fresh to me i went out one day and old mrs jensen next door saw susans boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus first i want to go on record as saying that my susie was a virgin when she died let my daughter rest in peace my daughter was a virgin all he found were rodents no signs of foul play so there a sweet man that other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss let my susie rest in peace at christmas we had fought i didnt like her boyfriend i she has a birthmark on her hip it seems like my susan butmy guess is male somewhere

instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts two or three million at a crack total eight billion and change peoples china bank guest lists of every alist party on turnover night theyd be handy to disappear into so were invited to all of them the eight billion from them to us currency data so we can do optimum

who am i tomorrow it has to be tomorrow or forget the mask you should know when i come back here with the maskif anything goes wrong a detailed description of everything youve done goes to the prc we need to make the trade tomorrowoh my god oh my god and get someone to help around the house i can put them in a good school i dont even know how much money that is five million dollars oh my god a number for the whole group or for us its a good day i feel good for what sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea you think if you got no uterus and no breasts youre still technically a woman no hunhuh see thats not what the doctor said he said ones got absolutely nothing to do with the other well then its got ta be a different than whats in our water cause ours is okay the guys from pge told me they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine and you say this stuff this hexavalent chromium its poisonous an onsite monitoring well that means not around here this is a rough part of the world hard times not a lot of money not a lot of luck its a challenge staying healthy in a town like this heck even our dogs up and die i thought the same thing right off the bat thats why we went to see the doctor but hunhuh turns out ones got nothing to do with the other its a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there the chromium well thats what kicked this whole thing off cause of the chromium you bet paid for a checkup for the whole family and not like with insurance where you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed either they just took care of it just like that we never even saw a bill well they paid for the doctors visit are you kidding with how our lives are if i start subdividing files ill be sunk i just kept all pge correspondence in one place so the whole idea of selling the house dont get me wrong id be glad to move to some better place but if they arent gon na pay us properly i just dont see the point thank you its in remission now thank the lord but you never know and then while thats going on i end up having to have a hysterectomy plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts all benign so far but still no matter how positive you stay an operation can still take it out of you i know theyre more than a bit unusual see two years ago pete got hodgkins disease thats a kind of cancer cause first you got ta move then theres decorating and if the windows arent the same size you know youre making all new curtains honest to god i dont know if i have the energy you know ive been sick me and peter both have thank you i think so too thats why im being such a stickler on this house price thing i dont mean to be a pain in pges backside especially after all theyve done for hinkley but i look around here and i think if they want this place theyre gon na have to pay for it and i dont just mean pay for the house id like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over i added air conditioning put in the pool made all those pillows by hand well it oughta be with all the work i put into it youre a lawyer yesim gon na assume that was meant as a compliment anna and just say thank you what the fuck did you do with my stuff anna with this realestate valuing stuff could you remind me cause im a little confused about how exactly we do that oh hell im dyslexic that asshole smashed in my fucking neck he came tearing around the corner out of control what hey he hit me whats your point yeah theres two why which one yup any school you want its enough for whatever you need for whatever your girls need for whatever your girls girls need itll be enough five million dollars and hes making them give five million of it to you all both the judge came up with a number well then if youre feeling up to it maybe we should talk shop well i was gon na head over to the browns now i was thinking mandy really values your opinion you wouldnt happen to have a little time right now would you donna sure you are youre just a happier woman cause you dont have to deal with maxipads and underwire right but didnt you say he was paid by pge i know but the toxicologist i been talking to he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure and everything you all have is on that list yeah it was right up on the pge property over there seems like an awful big coincidence your water being messed with and you being so sick well hell maybe thats why you all have been so sick whats chromium the what wow why would they do that they did right but im sorry i dont see why you were corresponding with pge about it in the first place yeah i can see that i guess the only thing that confused me is not that your medical problems arent important but how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ill say holy moley yeah im real sorry to hear that yeah im real glad you brought that up i was going through your file here and i ran into these medical records they kinda surprised me right yeah i should learn to do stuff like that they make the place feel real homey this is a real nice place you got here hell no i hate lawyers i just work for them you got a minute im erin brockovich from masry vititoe hi donna irving two million dollars what is that ed i swear im not i wasnt gon na here what comes yeah yours is nicer careful you dont spit from here you could kill someone how do you know that say youd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i didnt up and quit over all this say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself say you were wrong oh now dont get all jealous ed i got a little something for you too you know what mr potter i completely forgot your birthday this year and seeing as how youve been so good to me i think that is a terrible oversight so what i been doing over the last few days is ive been putting together a present for you morning no im serious you know what kurt potter is hes the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place hes the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pge offered 20 million he doesnt work like us ed theres no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing fuck kurt why not the fuck im not i dont care what the doctor says okay good i think i should be the one to tell em cause they trust me more than when where fuck legal terms were talking about human beings here sick people a whole bunch of them are gon na be dead in ten years they need their money now we got ta get em to agree to the arbitration ed we got ta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to im sorry are you saying that if this thing goes to trial itll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money wait what do you mean ten years so why would pge offer it and if you had to guess between 50 and 400 million definitely i know im sorry do i get to hear what happened anyway if youre here to fire me your timings lousy perks jesus perks bullshit you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me after all ive done for you thats the thanks i get how dare you take that away from me not personal thats my work in there ed my sweat my labor my time if thats not personal i dont know what is fun jesus fun i kill myself for a year and a half hand you the best case of your life on a god damn silver platter remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place and you think of me as fun and what im not serious kurt thought what about you do you think anymore bullshit youd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you people dont fly down in their own god damn plane for just a meeting if you tell me to relax im gon na kick your fucking head off not in my world why the fuck should i respect her she insulted me why good counts whats a demur holy shit who do they represent god plus 40 percent of 20 millions a whole lot of money do you think wed do better by going to trial but it wont cover annabelle danielss medical bills so what are you thinking whoa no shit what kind of things come up you might want to think real hard about the amount too my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still dont make enough to afford good child care makes me think about looking around for a job where im appreciated for shits sake i want my paycheck by the end of the day fuck you make time cause i bust my ass for you i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you and what do you do for me huh you see the way im treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work im doing have you ever bothered saying hey erin doesnt get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause shes the best god damn employee ive ever had its my paycheck which i earned which i deserve which i shouldnt have to beg for that fatass bitch wont give it to me yeah i mind you bet your ass i mind i want my fucking money yeah yeah im fine no ed what with me running for my life i didnt have time to check those things i dont know big dark some guy in a truck he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles jesus im shaking get me a beer someones following me boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh dyou get his name course not jesus ed jesus they look like the secret service yeah i heard that one before if theyve sent that little shmuck baum again im gon na be real pissed off well good ed i like working with you too you didnt care about my case really it makes me sick jesus christ ed you know the more i work on this thing the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town then filled it with toxic water and were the ones whove got ta bust our ass proving things thats just not right oh they knew they had to know what do you mean dont give me that youre gon na get plenty rich off of this mr 40 percent we got those pge fuckers by the balls here yeah then gim me another raise no for your information frank cares what was in those ponds cause he used to spend half his day wading around them that was his job i guess it was a little too inconvenient so for fourteen years this stuff flowed into the groundwater free as you please see according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep into the ground but guess what it didnt help but no the real problems on the bottom they covered em over and not too carefully either cause you dig one inch under the surface and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock they used the hex chrom here in these cooling tanks as an anticorrosive then they dumped it here in these six ponds no she lived on the plume you never know another raise wouldnt hurt and with all the time im gon na be spending on the road ill probably be needing my own cel phone wont i youre doing the right thing mr masry kinda like david and whatshisname well i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967 a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then four more eleven people so far okay fine i dont know shit about shit but i know the difference we can get these people with a little effort i really think we can nail their asses to the wall and this shit is bad news mr masry not only does it attack every organ of the body it fucks with your dna too that means these peoples genes and the genes of their kids and the genes of their grandkids who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it bullshit okay so heres what ill do ill go on up to ted and rita daniels two of the nicest people youd ever hope to meet who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer ill tell them we cant help them cause you dont feel like working that hard thats crazy why not and i realized hes taking a chance too im the one whos injured and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gon na walk away with almost half my reward boy do i know how you feel first time i heard that number i said you got to be kidding me forty god damn percent mr masry mario gets lost going to the bathroom theyll be driving around the valley for hours and you cant i dont get why theyd do that at least they made an offer so you think we got em scared so far but that place is a pig sty i wouldnt be surprised if theres more ten theres a lot of other places i could work i want a raise and benefits including dental course i did boy you musta really finetoothcombed it then huh and you fired me jesus the ones in the box of files the box of files the one from your office it doesnt take a genius to look at those medical records and think somethings wrong they told her something but it cant have been too specific cause i talked to her and she sure didnt think her water was bad you wan na know you got ta hire me back i got a lot of bills to pay boy are you ever a shitty judge of people now why in the hell would you assume that well that was nice of him isnt it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give em the ax oh yeah what are you doing here bullshit youre trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed fuck if ill help you do that dont bother i left a message ive been dealing with that real estate thing i was gon na write up a whole damn report and i guess im not the right kind excuse me yeah i got it no problem out to lunch with the girls give her a cold washcloth to suck on i got ta go theres a clean one in that bag ill check back in a bit sorry my kid i dont wan na take your money mr masry oh okay thats okay i was wondering could you tell me who id talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck just for the weekend im not everyone else mr masry im someone you made promises to that you didnt deliver on i trusted you with my kids wellbeing now im smart and im hard working and ill do anything but if you think im leaving here without a job you got another thing coming i dont need pity i need a paycheck and ive looked but when youve spent the last six years raising babies its real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn so i figure since youre the one who said i was gon na be okay you should be the one to hire me you said things would be fine and theyre not theres two things i cant stand mr masry being ignored and being lied to you did both you never called me back i left messages yeah well fuck you sorry doesnt feed my kids settle down i got 74 bucks to my name mr masry i cant afford to settle down bullshit you told me id get half a million dollars you told me id be set oh please it was long over by then god damn he made me look like some cheap open and shut open and fucking shut just wan na be a good mom a nice person a decent citizen just wan na take good care of my kids you know matthews six katies four and beths just nine months couldnt take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids they took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck i didnt have

we all helped youre going out there with those antibodies we must but we just cant leave him in there whatll happen to him i cant imagine how it possibly could have come loose i distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts listenthe heart he certainly is he should be up and about in no time i dont know yet doctor and i wont know until i test it air bubbles doctor doctoryou cant mean that not when weve come this far and if we give up therell be no way of saving mr benes but big enough for us theyre much smaller than bacteria i just wanted to thank you for taking me along i i want to say doctor look they follow the direction of her glance are startled to see what do you mean oh no plenty of cause he wont follow the herd or change his convictions even when theyre not popular and he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries and these days theres nothing more suspicious than that youre not the first but hes much too innocent much too involved with his work to realize whats going on around him thats why youre really here i knew it from the start keeping an eye on dr duval a great deal more than that i believe thank you for saving my life i feel much better now open it open it before they get here oh yes im sure dr duval could if we had the parts no it requires such absolute precision not anything built into the chassis if it hadnt come loose you cant its too dangerous shouldnt you answer that i have no idea but i did im positive doctor is it possible that were seeing it happen before our eyes and if it should take more time to get through i nevernever imagined it could be anythinglike this not working for someone like dr duval ive been with him since i got out of school he brought me into the cmdf over five years ago not in the hands of a great surgeon like dr duval the beam of this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter thatll teach you where to keep your hand you may learn to like it i think its the most exciting were going to see things no one ever saw before the actual physical process of life itself not something under a microscope just think of it you sound as

poverty you want any please would you do something for me i need you to check and see if theres a lump in my breast i cant afford to throw money away on a doctor youre such a nutcase i cant even begin to keep up dont worry im leaving like sex crime victims underwear insideout bound with electrical tape i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar what do you want to wait to hear me describe death this isnt a forreal suicide thing this is probably one of those cryfor help things me too i got a stomach full of xanax i took what was left of a bottle mightve been too much ive been going to debtors anonymous you want to see some truly fucked up people like testicular cancer really you havent been going to yours the forwarding number i havent seen you at any support groups where have you been the last few weeks i suppose should we looks like this is goodbye deal thats your favorite too tried to slip it by me eh so we each have three thats six what about the seventh day i want ascending bowel cancer so far you have four and i only have two i want that i want brain parasites ill take the parasites i dont know am i well technically i have more of a right to be there than you you still have your balls you take tuberculosis my smoking doesnt go over at all candystripe a cancer ward its not my problem really instead of just waiting for their turn to speak a year howd you manage that its cheaper than a movie and theres free coffee go ahead ill expose you telling me off is it going as well as you hoped mr taylor and i saw you practicing this what surei have to save eugene what did you see speed up another premonition what did you see what am i looking for i dont think so alexs premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it six duds in a row are you crazy what makes you think youd survive what are you doing youre going to kill us how you doing in there hero so lets do it please what else could it mean then it wasnt just a sign it was a premonition you were there you have to tell us now i hope youre ready for this i didnt beat it i hid from it if you were smart youd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog because what little life you have left is over as you know it dont make new friends dont fall in love and dont ever bother trying to save others thats the worst killer of them all thats what alex used to ask himself right up until if you have the same power as alex youll be seeing signs soon when you see anything creepy or ominous an inyourface irony kinda thing dont ignore it it usually means the difference between life and death thats good get all your tears out now youll need your eyes for the signs congratufuckinglations that makes you last to go but dont worry once the others are dead itll come back for you always does the survivors of flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash that was deaths original design deaths list the precise order youre going to die in well if you put them on the list theyre already tits up nice work maybe if youre real lucky youll wind up in here with me but i doubt youll survive that long yeah how kimberly burroughs eh what do you want she had the baby a guard grabbed me before i could find eugene if only alex and i had done that with the others alex might still be we need to hurry make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight holy shit he said only new life can defeat death if she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born a brand new soul that was never part of deaths design he probably already knows were coming a mortician he seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us thats why death is working backwards its tying up all the loose ends sealing the rift once and for all this chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited being alive after our time caused an outward ripple a rift in deaths design your entire world view just went out the window i couldnt expect a religious conversation overnight well get through this i promise random sure what about you kimberly did you anyone from flight carter what about the rest of you kimberly you were driving to daytona was route 18 your first choice the only reason he was on route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winningsno it cant be i was dead and came back to life an eeg machine wheres eugene yeah fuck em no offense what do you want me to do yes i was in a hospital there was screaming a nurse was choking me i couldnt tell what she looked like but the name tag was right in my face kalarjian no its not here this one was different more like the pile up and the van going into the lake this makes no sense isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested and when it was rorys turn to die and thomas was in the way what happened when eugene tried to kill himself out of turn no if anyone dies from a crash now itll be me but i cant die if eugene and isabella are still alive im last on deaths list what about that so if you give us the pregnant ladys number we can warn her about the lake and shell live long enough to have the baby i can practically taste the water in my throat and something else the smell of flowers i was driving a white van it mustve gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and i drowned it washorrible ii the second one just dies a 16 year old kid how can you say that what kind of monster are you the songs on the radio but wait i dont understand why is this even happening to me signs that still doesnt make sense you said you die in the same order you were originally meant to but evan shaeffer died last in my premonition not first officer burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends exact order then im next i was meant to die with my friends so im next what list its not just about me someone i saved died last night in a freak accident what if the others are in danger too i had a premonition about the route 18 pile up i saved some people and now i think death is after me i thoughti thought you might be able to help me for gods sake leave him alone dad welcome back we did it for real you cant cheat destiny i know what i have to do to save us i have to die im not sure i dont think isabella was ever destined to die in the pile up i dontwhat if i made a mistake i know how it feels to be dead shouldnt we pull over i think a nurse named kalarjian is going to choke isabella to death dont worry nothing can happen to us he cant breathe damn it i think his lungs collapsed how do you know are you thinking what im thinking how are we going to find her there must be thousands of white vans in this state it throws the entire death list out of whack and a new list has to be rewritten from scratch we all start over with a clean slate yeah i thought he was supposed to be helpful this is cheery we have to tell her shes in danger turn around the cleaning woman said theyre at the dentists 14th and main theyre next on the list we have to find them pigeons its a sign if clears right about the order then nora and tim are going to be attacked by pigeons clean up i dont then you believe all this that death is working off a list evan shaeffers dead my premonition was just like his billboards about accidents kids yelling pile up for no reason it all feltjust wrong just like the log truckand everybody i guess everyone was driving like a maniac and somehow i knew something horrible was going to happen even before it did like i said it was like i was there i remember everything the sounds of the crashes the smells the look on shainas face youre not listening to me you have to do something thats the truck thats going to kill everyone theres going to be a pile up logs bodies everywhere i saw it happen it happened highway to hell highway to hell theres going to be a huge accident everyones gon na die all of us i saw it theres going to be a huge accident everyones gon na die all of us i saw it whats the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona i can live with thaaaa this trip better be worth it whats the guygirl ratio again no im good i guess so ii dont know sure i dont know whats weirder the dialing a wrong number part or that death would set you up nine months in advance more than that all the songs on the radio were about car crashes some kids banging toy cars together she was dialing her cell phone with her headset on his car was leaking oil all over the road i used to have those feelings too but thats when id think of mom her strengthand courage and id pray that maybe id grow up to be as brave as she was and the bad thoughts would go away i love you too dad goodnight that its not over yet i know its crazy but im really scared for the others ive got this terrible feeling i will dad bye luv you you got it dad ill call you if i have a problem hey dad whats up i know dad i know this is the first time weve been apart since but everythings gon na be okay relax dad its daytona not mongolia thanks dad ill call youno no dont police are coming get out get out of the car carter get out cant you open the door stop the car billy told the fbi he saw you runnin away from her house were takin you to a cabin in the woods its only a couple miles from my house keep off the highways theyll be lookin for us nothing is anymore those guys are probably fifteen minutes away most kids never have it happen alex on the plane you must have experienced some kind of hyper awareness but here youre suggesting tods death and maybe our own will happen because of an active presence i dont understand did you see tod die did it happen again like on the plane thats total bullshit you can find death omens anywhere you want to wait i thought you meant the time of your birth fourtwentyfive as in month and day thats a reach 425 like 425 no thirtynine as in flannels and plaids ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod hes not dead i think but whyd they make him up like michael jackson doin somethin im not supposed to then lets go see him is that something youre feeling it thats why i was there last night like you the sculpture doesnt even know what or why it is reluctant to take form and yet creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction not a likeness its how you make me feel alex it is but that didnt stop me shouldnt stop you yeah but everythings always in transition if you focus even now one week into summer you can feel autumn coming almost like bein able to see the future hes not a witch we dont need this now i know what youre doing its alright to be scared carter you dont have to prove to us how big your balls are not now get control of yourself not with us in the fuckin car knock it off he didnt say nothin just drive theyre watching me see if i go to alex what are you doingit doesnt hurt why doesnt it hurt what was that why you dont feel love not allowed dead inside maybe you make yourself dead already so

creating and which also explains why women are attracted to men because lets face it the devil is a helluva lot more interesting i slept with a few saints and let me tell you booooorring and so the

rearranging the hors doeuvres as people eat them so the platters will always look full i dont start conversations because i have no idea how to end themi think im just meant to live in the background of things i think some people are meant to be alone maybe i was a man in a former life and i used women for pleasure so now im paying for it which would be fine if i could just remember some of the pleasure parts my mother calls every week like a recurring nightmare so have you met anyoneno mom so whats going to happen i dont know mom i only thank god i moved out i never reallywent through a dating period meeting people i mean its not easy in this day and age well theres nobody special do i look like i have someone special my parents were divorced you threw him out will it hurt no thank

im not feeling well and then well exchange phone numbers and youll leave and never call and ill go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch why am i putting myself through this it was very nice uh meeting you good night and then well probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and and well then youll sleep over and then in the morning youll be distant and you wont be able to stay for breakfast youll just have some coffee maybe well youre walking me home i i guess youre sort of attracted to me and youll want to come upstairs for coffee i mean you dont have to say nice things to me that kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what were about to do you dont have to say that no reallybelieve me there isnt any more this is it there isnt any more to tell what do you do for a living i mean how do you know him we mostly publish trashy romance novels why does it sound exciting theres absolutely nothing exciting about it iuhi get to read some of the books but mostly ijust calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback after paperback its basically someone elses problem what a gyp got any ethel merman i dont like uh polish love stories i like musicals i dont like horror movies ohlike moses parry parryi hope it will yes im sorry yes im trying to be delicate with you but youre not understanding me its not just because of carl or my music but because of you i mean what would it come to if a person has no love for himself no respect no love for his work his family his friends something how can he ask for love in return i mean why should he ask for it no its useless robert it wouldnt work not ever please ill see you later this evening im sorry everythings been so confusing but i have to go robert what i cant hear you i cant do that i havent been being fair to carl i have to tell you that no i cant no you dont have to it isnt necessary ill be back later im going to pick up some friends of carls are you all right i could spend some time with you tomorrow morning before carl comes back i mean if youd like to robert do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now yes carl restored my confidence he really did hes much more substantial than you give him credit for as a matter of fact hes the one who introduced me to carl how are you something witty and devastating like that i married him when i was 17 he was a cellist and i thought he was the most brilliant man id ever met and im sure he was because at that age i hadnt met that many but he was insidious you know he had me convinced that i was a mediocrity musically as a woman as an intellect but in this completely imperceptible pleasant way so that you werent even sure he was doing it anyway i just woke up one morning and i said you know something joseph youre full of beans and i left him i dont believe vou no inner feeling no dont do that yes thats whats important to me id like you to leave now is that direct enough i dont find your language that charming im not faking anything im looking for some bath oil im not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks and as for the day after tomorrow this is the day after tomorrow and i am unfortunately seeing you now if youll excuse me id like to take a bath i dont think thats accurate look you made a very calculated move and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you that wasnt necessary i think its what you think no youre very good at it im really impressed at being a fake well at least youre accomplished at something then i must have been supplying it you had no inner feeling it doesnt matter it was the feeling i was affected by why is that funny i was really very moved by the way you that was beautiful robert im surprised you dont call that music though i mean how could you not play anymore thats so strange to me one thing thats hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music and then just walk away from it without a second thought if youre free carl has hydrotherapy on tuesdays tomorrows a full practice day but the day after is kind of open after that i plan to read some music and rest for awhile right now im going to run a hot tub and soak myself i dont know let me give it some thought nothing then it must be very boring for you here well theres fishing and

tree and i guess i fell asleep all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree but the footsteps just stopped the woods were dark i couldnt see anything i heard a cracking noise behind me i turned around and and oh god there was this hideous looking man so grotesque he was almost inhuman he had a knife and he started to slash away at me again and again i was so hysterical and i dont know how i was able to get away i ran and ran but he kept coming he was big but so fast he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he he ripped my blouse off i was screaming but who could hear me then oh god he dragged me by the hair along the ground i was kicking and yelling he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods oh please please you promised youd never ask me im trying im really trying im here with you cant that be enough for now to prove something to myself to prove im stronger than i think i am

mother you did mother wont tell me how long youve been seeing this person shes embarrassed to tell me so why dont you tell me she is kicking you out oh please not now she wants you to stop seeing whats hername finally now and forever do you think thats too much to ask for a wife of nineteen years because you refuse to believe shes serious youve always refused because they get outstanding settlements and mother is determined that this time theres no turning back shes doing like those iranians i divorce thee i divorce thee i divorce thee is it so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer im seeing your play tonight remember i dont drink coffee daddy and this is not what we should be talking about i go to college i thought you knew see daddy what else see daddy yes and no more evasive tactics yes you wont even tell me your name whats shocking about a name knowing who a person is down deep deception isnt something i personally consider sexy what do we want i have this thing where i have to know a person is being honest with me before you know i can feel completely free to be myself yes a flatout hit packs an emotional wallop brilliantly moving you have to tell me what you thought of the play im willing to tell you my name why wont you tell me your nameim glad were having this talk i never thought of dr wetzel as having a sex life outside the office it violates so many trusts shes my gynecologist nicky no this is insupportable how could you joanne bourne i want to know we havent talked this way

talking to a prominent divorce lawyer i want to be fairminded nicky ive been looking for you because i want to let you know whats been going on before you read about it in a gossip column your father said you might be herealla puttanesca elliot litvak have you been ill and mr rogan how nice elliot guys ready to order he feels he has to defend himself if necessary he goes to the theater armed our steven not only disguises himself never mind do you want to talk about doing crazy things but you dont even know me how can you care what i do with whom if im sleeping with him and i havent said i am then so what no ones waiting home hes a very sweet man do you think he can do it sort of sometimes youre not building an obsession about steven are you look i understand opening night jitters but youve got one of the great actors in american theater starring in your play steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy no friends no phone is what true the fact is i have to get going he doesnt want to meet some outof work ingenue peter redmond is an actor i admire enormously i hear good things about the new play i was one of those silent listening children glued to the shadows alla puttanesca what a little drastic maybe engaging he has something a funny little quality i find a little not one of stevens finer moments i think i remember i was in the fishmarket play what happened to him we have a very nice pasta today alla putanesca im going home to my machine i dont want you steven yes ive seen your victims one past and one future i thought i might convince you to reconsider not if you stopped hurting people write the truth gently in other words i never understood until today how much pain and anxiety youve been causing with your reviews steven its so unfair i havent come to youthis could be it dont worry its a test because faith is rewarded washed away because god loves a winner matthew speak it like its real matthew then say it say it and youll believe it life is good say it if you believed you wouldnt be walking around with a handgun in your belt what does that tell me you want to make the night come down youre afraid to risk believing believe in them believe in your self take a risk it will humanize you as a person you made him strike out you wished it on him you want to lose its too hard for you to believe in something its hard to have faith its hard nwork to trust somebody it may be work but its not honest work faith is the real work your problem is you take the easy way out losing is easy its a simple subject and the people he hurts the most are the people who love him despite who he is and what he does for a living were always saying we want to take control of our lives you dont want to take control you want to lose control jesus knows it an

thats wrong then im sorry but it wasnt my intention i dont push for me i do it for you so you dont waste half your life feeling like you dont know where you belong i dont deserve that i have never looked at you as a disappointment if im on your back to do better if i push you to try harder its because i want you to be the best you can be what how can you im sorry if my friendship with tom

david where to i have so much to tell you mmm i made good time pilgrims in the back i found a new stable but they cant take him until tomorrow what do you mean hi um there doesnt seem to be any hotel

happening with the delco lawsuit no thats not what i said im not a dictator if you feel you should come then come just do whatever you think is right she will if you think she should robert were losing her were losing her i dont care what the doctors say the truth is they dont know anymore than we do less when it comes to grace this may not sound sensible or logical but nobodys suggesting anything better i cant explain it robert i just have this feeling this annoying bloody feeling that if if somehow pilgrim can be made all right then so can grace i just know it i dont care what he says we have to do something robert i cant sit here and trust everythings going to work out just by pretending it will i cant say hes been all that effective with her why im in charge i went back very soon after the accident they didnt expect me for a couple of months ill just take that time now i can still oversee things from montana take my fax my computer hell be sedated i know horses robert im the one who taught grace how to ride im not asking you to ill do it no i was just researching calm down ive called liz they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim i thought wed stay at motels along the way robert grace isnt adjusting to school and she cant sit in this apartment all day i think it would be good for her he did but i think i can change his mind about us going someplace warm someplace gracell have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses no yeah why did you go how was the dinner helping all the time running to her every time she trips or falls anticipating her all the time youve got to stop doing that do you do you really aw thats so sweet you can hardly get your arms around me how depressing youre so early sing it to me frankie oh right ill call him okay were very lucky no ill go you stay in case she wakes up i should go get some of her things what did he say tch what are you robert you leave it up these people that bags almost empty what about grace yeah bye i dont know well figure it out im sorry about last night i shouldnt have brought it up over the phone sure whats grace up to i should be in by two hi its me what choice its so cruel absolutely i made enough for an army well did you ever think about hiring a business manager oh i dont know you know thats interesting i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak i couldnt taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender i didnt know there was that big a difference between cows ive never been on a cow farm before i must say the bulls seem to have the best time of it just laying around the fields all day until theyre asked to do their work you too diane promise its just one night if i get uncomfortable ill go over to hanks i already know the way and its not like i have a job i have to rush home for between you and me i could use the time alone oh how sweet no no ill go just give me a list is there anything you need im going foodshopping i dont think anybody can make tom do anything he didnt want what sounds like something tom would say franks a good man did you always know this was the life you wanted delayed shock or maybe not i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or go to another magazine someplace just not sure if i want to no its more like a leave of ha ha ha yeah they fired me well i have more than a few days ha ha i uh im sort of not an editor anymore right now first time ive said it out loud you and frank ever take a vacation but uh egypt is well its like nothing else its like going back in time i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age centuries ago walking over that same ground was wondering about or if they had the same problems as me and i felt connected to to time itself almost ha i never realized how hard it was to describe oh god i think it was the fourth or fifth time id been there so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was i was there for that shot actually well i know i should reject that offer but im not going to thank you youre all doing too much i got a little confused though the ranch ellen was talking about thats not this one she calls him tommy where does this go diane its fine comfortable i still cant get used to how dark it gets around here though when we leave the ranch i always hold my breath until i can see the motel oh uh thank you no we dont want to impose uh no were going to dinner is this the way to the pasture would you mind if i did id like to talk to him of course not maybe we should give him another sedative and i can say the same thing about my daughter but she is suffering can you solve that problem i cant deal with this now liz if you need a yes or no right now then no dont do it not until i know grace is all right now please just do what you can okay please i just dont know right now do whatever you can and when grace is see what you can do for him liz listen the doctors here and i just cant uh talk now so well of course right wait uh i i dont understand start again hes alive her leg was shattered so they had to uh remove it she had some bleeding but its under controlgood luck to you annie promise now are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself there are plenty of people round here who do that sort of thing i think im going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave just might be his first broken heart well i am going to go after lunch hes a good man tom is hes got a gift come from heaven above i swear but hes still a man and a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake and still make him think hes on dry land annie im not good at this kind of talk goes round and round a thing but never comes to it so lets just say what it is when you first came here i didnt like you and i was worried tom means a lot to me and this family dont go looking here for whatever you looking for dont make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time yes it does they dont come better but i dont deny there are times i wonder about things i wont have maybe one day ill get to see egypt maybe not but i know if you try too many different lives you can wind up with no life at all i fell in love after that i never thought about being anything but a ranchers wife i never saw it like i was losing some other life just felt like i was gaining one i know thats not a popular opinion nowadays and i aint saying its the right one we all have to find the life meant for us guess you dont have to figure it out until you go home you dont seem to upset they fired you must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work huh soon were going to branson missouri to see my cousin emma married frank loves in there id love to go there one time what was it like i was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting

to her therapy exercises for you i have to go in once a week for shopping anyway ha she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old he ran off they found him in the barn sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise always did i think she favored him a little you tend to when you have

the next one clocks ticking ticktock you win okay pull over uh eighty two shut up and play darling your turnyou mean john bubber i read the probation report its not good i think youre going going to prison mister bernie i know that scares you but so you can call me naive mister laplante well as you like to point out mister laplante im relatively inexperienced my naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance i was inspired by the hero how he stuck his neck out for others how he took a chance i took a loan on my car and my computer mister laplante i really want to help you but crazy stories are only going to make it worse the da is asking your bail be set at twentyfive thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail the angel of flight 104 youre telling me youre the a uh i know youre having financial difficulties mister laplante but i wonder if i mean the money i loaned you i think you should visit your son and try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job you need to create the impression of a responsible decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once its november how recently i understand how often do you see your son are you pretty involved in his upbringing and a son by your exwife joseph we can hope you still have your job right i think our best course right now would be to focus on the probation officers report he means prison mr laplante i got your bail continuedmister laplante bernie i just for a few moments i want to be a human being not a reporter im somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and i looked up and some man came out of the smoke his face smeared with mud and soot and and he saved my life off the record was it you why would you deny it if it was because you took my purse why was it you in the plane who saved my life listen mister laplante uh bernie who are you i snuck in well for your childs sake show some decency then rise above your sleazy instincts you may have already killed him well maybe i wouldnt liebut i could tell the story the way i did just now so that people could understand that john is even more of a hero and that you youre the lowest thing that ever crawled your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail you wont get a cent i could deny i had those credit cards on the plane with me laplante all this is off the record chucky because if john bubber lives mister laplante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more misbehavior on his part whats more hes going to apologize in all that smoke and fire john had a moment of weakness hed been down and out destitute living in his car it was just an impulse stealing my purse you think i havent figured it out just because the cops arent on to you yet doesnt mean youre home free im a veteran reporter ive seen your kind before the underbelly of crime a lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet blackmailing a national hero he had one tiny uncharacteristic moment of weakness thats not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime yes everybody is in love with john bubber the whole country in fact and theyre not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little moneygrubbing lowlife fence if anything happens to john bubber mister laplante im going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law here here ten thirty fifty bucks how much have you got chucky give mister laplante your money if youre not in the car in ten seconds ill have the cops pick you up for gods sake tell him im on my way lets go chucky a police escort is gon na pick us up en route you too laplante whats your scheme mister laplante what are you forcing john bubber to do what are you how did you acquire this mister laplante camera chucky are you bernard laplante sir what is your relationship with john bubber no john youre too hard on yourself ive got the creep here the guy whos john i know all about it its no big deal it just looks better carrying me oh you mean because i wasnt carrying my purse at the time i just remembered you were talking about bodybuilding and swearing there like that kind of uh sexy you can support me anytime john youre doing fine you didnt actually lift me though it was more like you supported me now you help me up boy you seem taller it must be psychological now that i know you saved my life read it itll be fine you were very inspiring goodnight john i know the truth john im flying in some guys from your unit in vietnam tomorrow interviewing them live on network hookup no i dont have the right youre a news story you did save my life and its me id be taking advantage of you im a reporter john an experienced professional i i i know that john years there are going to be lots of opportunities uh if you could just uh support uh a small airfield john im sure she could support just about anything i think ill see you to your room a sort of bodyguard make sure no harm comes to you youre a celebrity john people are going to want to please you or use you or both unworthy of the adoration we all do instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody youve known john bubber all your life youre used to him you know youre the same human being you were before all the excitement so you feel like a fraud all the adulation it makes you feel like a fake doesnt it you were saying you dont want a million dollars because he was a real hero chucky he was acting out of a deep instinctive decency not out of some ego thing he didnt expect the media to lionize him he didnt expect a million dollar reward he saved fiftyfour people because something inside him some fundamental love for his fellow man made him rush into that plane when good sense told him otherwise he was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to laplante for how much laplante a couple of bucks did you give him enough for a decent meal and sold it to mister laplante the fence whos now trying to blackmail poor john for excellence in the pursuit of truth thesilvermikeaward this sofa is a lethal weapon the springs are the springs what youre lucky chucky you ow maybe maybe not i have a feeling this guy is important somehow whatre we talking about reach out for what did you get it jesus did i say that hell do it you reallyshould have talked to him first there could be problems with something like that mister wallace what if a mystery guy not a passenger who you said all the passengers were accounted for would the station put me up at a good hotel the story behind the story the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire the dirt you mean you just cant bear the idea of good news it would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical hardbitten newswoman besides it wouldnt be a bad story would it newswoman saves suicide i havent won it yet i notice youve got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony i said i wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him i didnt say i thought we should have saved him hello mister wallace hi chief you like the suicide i wonder if youd mind if we waited for him here mister winston shouldnt we have buzzed him to let him know we couldnt find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox but were from channel four yes wed like to find reporters have to rise above their hormones dont be ridiculous im a reporter hes pretty remarkable look at the guy he just saved fifty people now hes going to disappear who is he nobody stole my credit cards they burned up

unless theyre immortal for three hundred years yes if they were trying to get in but what if they werent what if they were trying to get out why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern

into the cavern had collapsed the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks making a hole in the collapsed section what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the

just something like that oh thank god youre dead i know i know your eminence just say god go with me im going to find out you got it operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and im the punchline i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower a little petting is not the issue he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure but he knew right and wrong oh and we kind of messed around i betrayed a man a good man an innocent man a thief yeah the big e thats the best kind a wise woman once said polite conversation is rarely either no your eminence i think hes going to steal the codex as early as next week hudson im afraid im sticking with god but youre a close second tough guy what is that smile holy shhthings are going to get very interesting very fast da vinci would be proud of you wha you dont want to know da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded the way the machine is running now the gold will produce too quickly clog and the machine will shut itself down isnt it wonderful trust leonardo oh hudson im a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent oh hudson uh yeah guess im a wee bit nervous im sorry i could only score clergy passports you re not some guy anymore hudson right now youre the only guy without your help i its that kind of selfish attitude that its from the machine all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 23 of it already we cant let that happen where did you get this iworkforacovertvaticanhumanitarian organization theciamadeafoolofme icareforyou hudson dont you understand oh i must have put too much ethylchloride in it the ci what god no for two years ive been tracking the mayflowers peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces their sforza replica was as fake as the gas leak that supposedly destroyed it what are your plans for the weekend hoisting away the colosseum tell me did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower you really went and did it with one day not even a day of planning you did it nobody does it better hudson you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex somebody robbed the vatican its also been a long time for me i im sorry i cant i oh im so sorry what have you been doing wow you were in the joint doing hard time its funny but that excites me i seem to have a thing for sinners how long were you in prison oh hudson i was worried you werent going to drop by secret passageways dont mean as much as they used to theres a place two blocks east of here enzos say 1030 ill bring my entire repertoire i dont steal stuffed elephants from little girls and i buy my own clothes my lifes a little boring actually i wrote it its a good sentence it can apply to people nice but right out of our brochure delivers up to ten at night the pope has an obsession with his easter seals its actually not that an unusual setup the secret passageway on the other hand sure hudson are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo come on this stuff will knock you out have you ever had the feeling you were being followed mr bond question sir his untiring pen predicted the airplane the submarine the bicycle the helicopter and even the tank as you know the da vinci codex has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more tough guy what are youhows your head thanks tough guy thanks a lot why was the guard chasing you no i meant you didnt have to tackle me and rip my dress a polite push perhaps a clear shout of watch out anna would have done nicely my god that was bold of you you didnt have to do that fantastic perfection the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder cat got his tongue oh lord the only reason i ask is that hudson uh mr hawk hawkins had some neat things to say about darwin minerva and you basically that youre part of the same car pool when the mayflowers find out we have the codex theyre going to want to make a dealhello im plenty happy im happy enough well in connection with my job sometimes i have to go undercover as it were its hardly the same well maybe i why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president that smart so if you know everything about hudsucker tell me why the board decided to make norville barnes president yeah yeah say you wont tell anyone about me will you but who are you what dyou do here who are you how did you know who i am muncie yeah and ill bet his initials are sidney j mussburger but al its the bunk norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him why buzz couldnt have invented it look at the man hes

genuine article the guy is a real moron im telling you smitty the board of hudsucker is up to something lumbago and is this guy from chumpsville i pulled the old mother routine well that just about does it ive seen norville barnes the young man in a big hurry and ive seen norville barnes the selfimportant heel but ive never seen norville barnes the quitter and i dont like it just give me another chance norville i can help you fight this thing i know this last story was a lie we can prove it we can norville im sorry i i tried to tell you so many times its hard to admit when youve been wrong if you could just find it in your heart to to give me another chance oh norville i norville consider this my resignation shutup after all you havent talked to me for a week and now im going to say my piece ive got a prediction for you norville barnes i predict that since youve decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad youre going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you youre going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that wouldnt give you the time of day if you if you shutup but then i figured out you were a swell guy a little slow maybe but a swell guy well maybe youre not so slow but youre not so swell either and it looks like youre an imbecile after shutup and dont think i havent noticed how youve changed i used to think you were a swell guy well to be honest i thought you were an imbecile ive been watching you norville barnes even though youve been trying to avoid me youre awful kind to yourself norville barnes the fact is youve slowed down sitting up here like a sultan not doing a lick of work why you know its ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you havent come up with one since the hoop and the reasons plain to see youve forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place it wasnt for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of would you get out of here your i you mean you know about this theyre going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker why in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work people with wives and children and families you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing never mind about that for petes sake norville sure norville sure oh norville yeah i think ive heard of that what goes around comes around i wish it were that simple norville i wish i was still a gazelle and you were an antelope or an ibex norville there really is something i have to tell you oh i dont know maybe i was just a fasttalking career gal who thought she was one of the boys what a beautiful thought the people look like ants well this year if its good i plan to make it a tradition uh my it certainly is beautiful yes you can get carrot juice or italian coffee and the people there well none of them quite fit in youd love it why dont you come there with me theyre having a marathon poetry reading on new years eve i go every year uh yes seventeen yes i well no i i never really theres a place i go now the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village its called anns 440 its a beatnik bar oh yes in muncie huh certain people are norville you cant trust people here like you did in muncie i believe in you norville at least i believe in your intentions you do norville theres something i have to tell you you see im not really a secretary im sorry let me hold it or youll have a real shiner let me look what happened maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance smitty oh is that it im quite sure i dont know what you mean confused sure but she could still have gotten your side for the record well i dont know maybe she does deserve it maybe she shouldve come in to face you man to man why dont i just type this up well i im sure i is that all mr barnes or lack thereof well i didnt bother to read the article i didnt think the picture did you justice well i just dont know how to thank you mr barnes of course i went to the muncie uh secretarial polytechnic oh no really i why yes do you know it these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town youve probably never heard of no thank you seek and ye shall find work and ye shall prosper these were the watch words of my education the ethics of my tender years a little naive perhaps but thank you armed with determination a solid work ethic and an indomitable belief in the future at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago full of dreams and aspirations anxious to make my way in the world what a horrible little person i dont want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life its not a happy story the couch please im sorry we had to take the stairs it was just that horrible little elevator boy i filed it yesterday on payday the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you al sez me amy archer why is he an idea man because hudsucker says he is whatre his ideas why wont they let anyone interview him as a threedollar bill i tell ya the guys a phony youre fools both of you its obvious theyre out to crucify norville theyre trying to destroy him says who you cant print that its about a dimwitted editor who ive got an even hotter story the sap from the city desk muncie i dont know why not its all true the board is using this poor guy theyre depressing the stock so they can buy it cheapwell frankly i sidney and i are planning a trip to paris and points continental arent we dear im brushing up on my french with the most charming man pierre of fifth avenue do you know him disappointment jetais destroyee i was in bed for a week positively sick with fury i called in the gardener and said monsieur gonzalez either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee so wed gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruinsyes miss betsy i mean that the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa no she was mindless but not like miss jessica but the houngan cured her they even cure nonsense miss betsy mama rose was mindless i was at the houmfort when the houngan brought her mind back at the houmfort there are other doctorsyes other doctorsbetter doctors doctors that are people cant cure everything things so bad nobody can help not even doctor maxwell a puffup i call it but miss jessica always says brioche i do my best every day i dress her just as beautifully as if she was well its just like dressing a great big doll she was very sick and then she went mindless miss miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast in bed with a lacy cushion to bank her head up if youd only seen her miss connell she looked so pretty i know miss but i like to do it i like to tend for miss jessica and i want to tend for you you settle right back now and ill mix you your coffee i didnt want to frighten you out of your sleep miss thats why i touched you farthest from your heart good morning missare you trying to tell me that the houngan the voodoo priest could cure mrs holland you mean mama rose was like mrs holland thats nonsense alma where what do you mean doctors that are people doctors and nurses can only do so much alma they cant cure everything looks like an awful lot of breakfast i dont know whether ill be able to get away with it whats this well see if we cant make her well alma you and i she must have been beautiful what happened to her alma thank you alma but im miss jessicas nurse alma you dont have to do that for me thank you for waking me but they came to a beautiful place didnt they you mean a figurehead alive timisery whats that mrs rand was at the houmfort that night but theres nothing wrong with that shes gone there for years trying to take care of those people to help them mrs rand thats sweet of you mrs rand but you didnt have to come up here but how did you get here what are you doing here but mrs rand mrs rand i heard the servants talking about someone called mama rose they said she had been mindless i dont mean believe like believing in a religion i mean do you believe it has power do you think it could heal a sick person you dont believe in it youve never said anything about voodoo before mrs rand ive no influence with mr holland id love to thank you mrs rand i think youre every bit as nice as wes says you are believe me mrs rand he doesnt do this often this is the first time ive seen him oh mrs rand im afraid so i would have stayed anyway dr maxwell ive worked with it ive seen cures it is at least a hope thank you is this disease common in the tropics she can never be cured does she suffer but its so far away the west indies that will mean another interview wont it that is good but id like to know more about the case they didnt teach it at memorial hospital i had my suspicions though about the directress of training at the memorial hospital here in ottawa yes no wes please wes do as i ask you must rest you must sleep but shes not dead wes not to a nurse sleep is a cure i dont know i once asked dr maxwell the same question he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken of course wes id like to go now rand would you mind taking me home that doesnt sound like him i wish i hadnt heard dont let it bother you so wes wait i want to listen im a nurse i always watch people when they pour something i watched tijoseph and it was exactly two ounces higher mathematics two ounces to a drink three drinks six ounces it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum but dont you have to work i was just beginning to wonder arent there shops restaurants and things its my day off perhaps you ought to get on to the mill i dont know he spoke to me last night on the boat i liked him very much mr holland of course its been nice of you to spend this much time with me i wondered about your different accents im still wondering about your names rand and holland but youre an american thank you but who sits there i like her already is she a doctor yes on the boat i guess ill wait until im home mrs rand you want that thats past thats over and done with dont paul dont doubt yourself dont make me doubt you you wanted to warn me i can understand that everyone feels that way about someone you cant believe that you dont know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad youre not vicious or cruel paul i still cant believe it paul that you wouldnt say a word in your own defense she was beautiful you know why you saw it the other night at the piano you turned away from me i told you i took mrs holland to the houmfort i thought they might cure her i wanted to help you and instead i came bringing you nothing i imagined this so differently she is alive mr holland thats all you didnt drive her mad i love fort holland i dont know i wanted to help you and now that im here i dont know how i know what you went through tonight i kept thinking of what you said that all good things died here violently i heard you playing you dont seem very disturbed by it ive always thought voodoo was something to be scared of the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened still i feel you should remove the decanter wes is not an alcoholic yet mr holland but as a nurse i can tell you that it wont be long before he is but for wes it must be a temptation to him yes he can but ive been wondering you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table well i had a good time up to a point good morning ive never given it much thought i suppose so yes mrs holland must have been beautiful im sorry of course not nothing really but you must admit its an eerie sort of place so dark if i were as timid as you seem to think mr holland i wouldnt have gone into the tower in the first place i am not a frightened girl a figure of st sebastian why was the maid crying i heard someone crying a woman cant i take it for you yes thank you you cant really believe that you read my thoughts mr hollandyou must betsy theyll have to believe you why betsy we cant lose you you mean too much to us here perhaps not but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me once started it seemed such an easy way to do good i should have known there was no easy way to do good betsy and when my husband died i felt helpless they disobeyed me things went from bad to worse all my husbands dreams of good health good sanitation good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him then almost accidentally i discovered the secret of how to deal with them there was a girl with a baby again and again i begged her to boil the drinking water she never would then i told her the god shango would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it she boiled the water from then on i asked you to let me explain its a long story and not an easy one i knew youd come and i knew id have to come up here and talk to you i couldnt let you go back without any word i came to tell you again jessica can not be cured wait dont draw any conclusions let me explain her son drowned she brooded until her mind was affected all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology frankly my dear i didnt expect anything like this from a nice levelheaded girl what are you driving at a missionarys widow it isnt very likely is it havent i i suppose i take it for granted its just part of everyday life here some of this native nonsense the houngan has his prescription and dr maxwell and i have ours try it you may have more influence than you think use your influence with paul ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table so he says im nice hes a nice boy too miss connell a very nice boy but im worried about his drinking nonsense child i know wesleys been drinking too much lately i know a great deal more about what goes on at fort holland than youd think i know all about you that youre a nice girl competent and kind to jessica the fort needs a girl like you but now weve got to get you back there ill walk you back and stay over night itll be a nice change for me come come dont tell me how sorry you are that i should meet you this way im even a little glad that wesleys difficulty brought us together i really intended going out to the fort and meeting you long before this miss connell im mrs rand wesleys mother tijoseph i think you need some help but i had no thought of harming her it wasnt i yes i said it and i made myself believe it but when i got here jessica was already raging with fever i hated myself i kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power they had no strange drugs that there is no such thing as a zombie its more than that doctor ive entered into their ceremonies pretended to be possessed by their gods wesley im quite sure nothing will happen doctor i wouldnt worry too much commissioner itll pass weve had this sort of thing before that night i went to the houmfort i kept seeing jessicas face smiling smiling because two men hated each other because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart the drums seemed to be beating in my head the chanting the lights everything blurred together and then i heard a voice speaking in a sudden silence my voice i was possessed i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie betsy tell them about the houmfort tell them what you saw there youre wrong wesley the guilt is mine all of it dr maxwell its nice to see youoh you know for a minute i thought it was ben i dont think he wants us here the phones out well talk in the morning youll get some sleep on the couch out there ben ben ive got a ride home maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here were not going anywhere thanks for the diagnosis ben thank you so lets just go to this fiasco if thats what you want to do lets just go on in id rather talk to anyone else but you well im really pleased to hear a confession you have some marker thats what i think if you want to know the truth you have some marker and youre going to put it on the house keys so that janey can find them and then when i get back to the house ill find the two of you in there and wendyll be able to hear you and paul will be back and hell hear you and ill catch you thats what i think shell be swearing and banging against the wall and ill catch youre not going to damn it ben well that this was going to be a key party this just isnt the best moment for this in the car benjamin thats supposed to explain it oh lord you think im so dense and now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party you want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesnt go with those pants at all you want to wear that and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and youre not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this you dont really know what this feels like if youre going to insult me its a starting place your unfaithfulness thats what im trying to talk about your unfaithfulness your betrayal your dalliance and you wont do me the dignity of being up front about it im not surprised dont be dim it wouldnt make a pleasant evening if thats what youre after i dont want to talk about it stupid mustache cup i have no idea dont start see for yourself that one oh right the mustache coffee cup the one that was sitting on the dash so what were you doing in the williams basement anyway up to you id like to go early and leave pretty soon after that dinner in ten minutes the turkey in leave it ill wash it for you that shirt i wasnt accusing you ben its just that weve got to be honest not just with ourselves but with the children no i didnt mean to sound negative it was but ben what is going to happen with us have you im just sad ben i mean it was you were but you know i just dont know ben maybe no talking right now if you start talking youre going to i i think i am because you like it on your turkey sandwiches oh sure i did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce hmm good night so early what do you think the halfords have invited us again this year good night and you havent moved out yet its because youre too lazy ben too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision its you ben who needs to talk ive had my say and im waiting to hear back from you so maybe youll come too i did but somebody should probably see her talk to her you think shes ok ive been thinking ben about wendy i was going to ask if shed come with me sometime

married to him for 17 years and i dont have any intention of going in there to get him so what im proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy and since you are standing here alone im

course shhï½ï½ï½ its all right ï½ ill be all right its getting dark i cant leave now no thats theas bed miss wollstens bed is in there how kind you are it is so comforting to know that someone cares what are you doing she has never mentioned her family some village in the mountains alethera i think im so ill im so exhausted i almost dont care we quarreled she never dared get angry or frightened but i said things to her it was an attack i know it was suppose she isnt dead suppose it was a cataleptic attack when i close my eyes i see miss wollsten i cant think of anything else that should decide it or you come thea if youre going to claim him as your father youve got to make up your mind theyll be leaving any minute the general ï½ you dont even know him thea your choice is a very simple one either you want to claim him as your father or you do not i have forgotten it dear what is it what are you talking about thea youre hiding something why do you suddenly speak of your father you told me once you had never seen him didnt know him why i love my father because because i do of course hes nice to me what an odd question thea is an orphan the young man mr davis seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer ï½ï½ a correspondent of some sort ï½ï½ wouldnt i when i tell him that youre unfit to live a normal life with normal people ï½ a cataleptic really this is idiotic would you care to explain what youre talking about no i mean your other secret ï½ the one you kept bidden even from my father that old doctor in london he told me you will not say one single word i know your secret why im fond of thea what if he is what would i be thinking you were fathers secretary ï½ i never thought how do you know what my father thought miss wollsten whet do you meanyou wouldnt

working at him ï½ ï½ turning him against thea ive always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours ï½ï½ but this cathy even i would never have believed it is of you that your father and i ï½ï½ youre planing something cathy but i wont let you ï½ ill warn them against you but thea she stands in your way i know you i know your little hints ï½ï½ the way you can turn the truth into a lie mr davis seems a good prospect ï½ï½young handsome sympathetic ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you didnt you but now what are you thinking now your father loved me he wanted to marry me but he was afraid of hurting the gentle delicate cathy you spoiled his life ï½ï½youve ruined mine ï½ï½ your father knew it too but he was never sure how much was pretense you and your mysterious illness a new attack everytime you are crossed ï½ everytime you cant get your own way they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning cathy thats what you are ï½ï½ a weak pale halfdead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live i wish i didnt have such bitter knowledge of you cathy thats superstition thats something out of old tales about the dead who live ï½ im talking of something else cataleptic attacks apparent death that is not real no i want more than that i beg you general make sure drive a knife through my heart anything i dont want to be buried alive if i die i want to be sure ï½ quite sure i have not had a happy life but that one thing that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep ï½ i want to avoid it im a woman a lonely woman i have few friends because he was a brave man because i liked him i came here to be sure i wanted to be sure of something general something that has always preyed on my mind i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in ï½ entombed ï½ï½ imprisoned i dont care who he is he doesnt know he cant tell ï½ï½ no no i wont believe it hes not deadit was the plague she is dead ï½ at peace you should sleep cathy lie down and close your eyes try to forget everything i will let him go he is dead to me as he is to all my mothers people i turn my hand against him i felt he did not like me i dont know as a child i longed for a father and now ï½ i dont know ï½ï½ but one must love a father my last name is pherides you have forgotten my last name i do not know him but i have seen him i mean does one love a father because he is good and kind ï½or just because he is ones father cathy ï½ how does it feel to have a father you are fortunate in your father and the soldier he looked at me so strangely who is he no you musnt he thinks ive bewitched you he wont believe it ï½ hell hate me even more my only chance is to stay away from him for a moment when he looked at me so sadly i felt that i had wronged him but then then why does he persecute me my family told me what kind of man he is how he stole my mother and then abandoned her it is for that he hates me it is more than a

where are you going i dont even know this woman hi dadweve got to see one to find out is there any why wouldnt they look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds and lets forget about the high hide we cant do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible ian youre not insane im so glad not without a shot of the nest that was a pair bond a family group even long after that infant was nestbound youre going too what oh god dont start a legal argument with me this island isnt your property and neither are these animals these formations theyre dried ian its guano ian they will misplace our evidence shoot holes in our testimony and say some special effects genius created the animals the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a trex in the middle of times square you know even if we do get those tapes back people are going to say its just another hoax ian malcolms alien autopsy what they will come after me but i can collect some stool samples for dna with that nicks tapes and the rest of you to back me up it should stand when we get back i swear to god it works with lions sometimes there we are your baby is free born free as free as the wind blows as free as the grass grows thats impossible they cant have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here it has to be temporary something thatll break apart and fall off as the animal grows funded by whom lighten up ian you sound like a high school viceprincipal what do you want to do ian lock her up for curiosity where do you think she gets it no more smoking we leave no scent of any kind no hair tonics no cologne seal all our food in plastic bags we will observe and document but we will not interact wheres ian what are you no hold it down nick well kill it with too much well put it into respiratory arrest im almost done damn it i need another adhesive something pliable i can that little black line means death for this infant the fibula wont heal straight so the ankle joint cant pivot when he stands on his hind feet the baby wont be able to run and probably cant even walk itll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old ian nothing we observe will be valid if were trailing along in the wake of an army ian if we recall the boat now weve made two invasive landings in one day thatll have to go in any paper i write and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated you know the academic world as well as i do once they smell blood in the water youre dead our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic that means if we bend a blade of grass we bend it right back the way it way we could safely i believe in him ians a very good friend of mine you think this is all a joke very noble of you you dont think youre bringing that thing onto the island do you that must be interesting what drew you there so whats your story nick youve got to be kidding ask her we have to send someone to look for him move where our boats not coming for two days your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send hey we came here to observe you came here to stripmine the place its a looter mentality all you care about is what you can takehow long will this take how would we cut off the lysine but would we get the phones back wait

mean whats hanging us up oh you know if its alright id like to stay with dr harding and finish with the trike is that okay yours was fully illustrated honey alan where are we going you see something the question is how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem and therefore how could you assume you can control it you have plants right here in this building for example that are poisonous you picked them because they look pretty but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century theyre living in and will defend themselves violently if necessary paleodna from what source where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood ill catch up with you you can go with the others theres only one way to be positive i need to see some droppings i have to see the dinosaurs

people we love alan lex and tim and john theyre out there where people are dying people are dying you know john john john youre still building onto that flea circus that illusion and now youre adding

oh my god oh my god i have samples all over the kitchen did i say jerk i cant get it i cant get it unless i move you cant hold it by yourself yes unless they figured out how to open doors ill just finish yeah i want to finish and when she swallows the stones she swallows the poison berries too thats what makes her sick good work tim barfs them up which is called a gizzard and it helps them mash their food but what happens after a while like birds what happen is they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs the undigested state of the berries because its yeah i know constantly sick i know its my favorite oh shit cant we see the unfertilized host eggs so what are you thinking we were right youve got a trex hes got a trex a trex he said hes they were wrong

scare the kid you couldve just pulled a gun on him postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments velociraptor a drought the lake was shrinking if they died together they lived together

here they dont bother me why are we hurrying if theres nothing wrong i dont know im sorry i dont know i dont know im sorry im sorry im sorry whats going to happen to the goat hes going to eat the goat we love the presents we miss youyoure detestable youre just doing your job not today burgel send one of your memos write up one of your communiques but for gods sake dont bother me today say what you like no one pays the least attention i do always you understand the world better than any of us kafka and what its becoming ive always held you in the highest regard i know better than you what people will say when they have to when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day i think youve just escaped for the moment just as i did as eduard did as they let us do but only for the moment why should i believe a man who never believed me theyre absolutely right you know guilt should never be doubted its easier that way i know there is and youre what i have to bargain with for now youre the last one in their way i know how they reward failure if they saw this id be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others this is the result of their elixir of youth they were to come and check on it during the night i contrived to miss the appointment only two steps back even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists why i became a murderer because murder is bliss its easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil once youve adopted its procedure over its only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit i knew you walked this way to work i wanted to find you before they did what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails youre far from understanding the authorities if you believe that or what if there really was an error i dont know what kind any kind that needed correcting and what if burgel was responsible for it one mistake even a small one in a firm like ours it could cost him a promotion and burgel is the bringer of messages isnt he how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records of course he is the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark people disappear up there regularly if you want to lie in wait for someone thats the place to do it he used to like me very much more than i liked him burgel hated eduard and me im sure he knew about us and im sure it drove him mad its still easier for you to understand suicide isnt it you might think i thought so myself at first that burgels too insignificant to be dangerous but thats the very reason to beware its the small men to watch out for the ones who substitute method for character i wouldnt put it past him of course it could burgels been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember he couldve killed eduard theyre not obliged to tell burgel i didnt leave it with him im collecting eduards things if theres anything you want take it or ill give it to charity yes which is why quiet dependable people have to take charge of their own lives you think what were doing is so wrong and what are you doing pursuing goodness for what to answer to some supreme tribunal when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day its liable to create a false impression youre shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window he was murdered he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division apparently one of his claims was relevant the day he died eduard was called up to the castle did you know that you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of your fellow men and yet youre able to remain an outsider with the concomitant air of superiority i nominated you as a possible candidate you were eduards good friend he read me some of your work theyre ubiquitous what we try to do is make them a little less so you wont have any trouble finding it im suspicious of men who want to marry i believe they think its the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers eduard wanted to marry me you almost married recently didnt you there are some people id like you to meet can you come to the musil district at eight oclock are you free tonight the very fact that theyre authorities should give you reason people will do anything to protect their own interests for all you know he was killed at the hands of the police and you believe everything the authorities tell you do you think people in the new town care what happens over here this will always be the ghetto eduard didnt see it as something that needed bearing two or three months thats all i seduced him as long as its on their terms if your work and your private life dont correspond to their specifications youre labelled a dangerous agitator with no recourse whatsoever whats funny its not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office what he would have you were his best friend a better friend than me i was having an affair with eduard he didnt tell you yes have you looked hello again excuse me i have to copy this for central docketing by 230 one of you must be mistaken why would you suppose so i knowget the hell out of here take your filthy paws off him you ignorant pig to be quite honest mr denham i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible its lovely can i see the map my father spoke of references to a beast god theres no hard feelings mr denham i just want to come to the island with you im coming onboard throw down a ladder look mr denham youre not welcome here just pack up your cameras and go oh god its that bloody yank father its somewhere southwest of here we need to inform the museum ï½ organize an expedition father father father i photographed it extensively father a neolithic bronze reminiscent of the nias island cultures it s very curious defiantly pagan the use of ivory for the spear is quite unique what do you think it s alright jack it s alright youre the

discovery of the last two hundred years it belongs to him im going to that island nothings going to stop me where do i charter a boat no god youre so obnoxious our work happens to be of great anthropological value how dare you my father is the british museums most respected archeologist tell me mr driscoll is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down no its not ok were not about to be robbed blind by some twobit hustler on the make hes grubbing for money fatherdid he come around often arlyn just tell me did jane have a dumper

it and you just want to ask me a few questions youre not police or fbi youre just a private investigator dew yew hayuv ahdentifikyshun honest why gee who you said that what about what is itbecause my son is here and his father is here as a mother i dont want my child to be separated from his father yeslook during the last five years we were married i hadi was getting more and moreunhappy more and more frustrated i needed to talk to somebody i needed to find out if it was me if i was going crazy or what but every time i turned to tedmy exhusband he couldnt handle it he became veryi dont know very threatened i mean when ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack anyway we became more and more separate more and more isolated from one another finally i had no other choice i had to leave and because of my exhusbands attitudehis unwillingness to deal with my feelings i had come to have almost no self esteem at the time i left i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with methat my son would be better off without me it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i wasnt a terrible person and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child that didnt make me unfit to be a mother yes very much i make thirtyone thousand dollars a year yes i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer yes i tried to talk to ted my exhusbandabout it but he wouldnt listen he refuses to discuss it in any serious way i remember one time he said i probably couldnt get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby sitter for billy no i did not the first couple yes but after that it became increasingly difficult six years yes i consider it less my failure than his i was not a failure we were married two years before the baby and then four very difficult years yes i suppose ii dont know somewhere in between i dont recall i dont recall no no no no no no yes okayi think ill go talk to my son now how do i look only can i still see him hes already got one mother he doesnt need twohes yours i wont fight you for him any more hes yours after i leftwhen i was in california i began to think what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child it got to where i couldnt tell anybody about billyi couldnt stand that look in their faces when i said he wasnt living with me finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved himand i did and i won onlyit was just another should sitting in that courtroom hearing everything you did everything you went through something happened i guess it doesnt matter how much i love him or how much you love him i guess its like you said the only thing that counts is whats best for billy i dont know maybe thats all love is anyway ted i think billy should stay with you pleaseplease dont stop me this is the hardest thing ive ever had to do ted when we got married it was because i was twentyseven years old and i thought i should get married andwhen i had billy it was because i thought i should have a babyand i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and ted do you love him ted do you love him please ted i never would have brought it up if i thought im sorryi just mentioned it in passing i never thought hed use it ted if you cant discuss this rationally ted all my life id either been somebodys daughter or somebodys wife or somebody elses mother then all of a sudden i was a thirtytwoyearold highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get only i guess it wasnt far enough so i started going to a shrink ted ive had time to think ive been through some changes ive learned a lot about myself ted listen to meyou and i we had a really crappy marriage look dont get so defensive okay it was probably as much my fault as it was yours anyway when i left i was really screwed up i want my son im through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street i want my son tedthe reason i wanted to see youi want billy back watching my sonted ive been living in new york for the past two months he looks like a terrific kid a few times sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him

night so he wont have to go home you want to know why ill tell you why another scotch and soda for the gentleman ill tell you exactly why because youre not his buddy anymore because he cant count on

relationship charley my husband and i are divorced and kim thats our daughter is about billys age and the children play together a lot so i guess we see each three or four times a week six years ever since ted and joanna moved into the building ted i just heard maybe i said maybe what i mean is ahi dont think itll really work out but charley seems to want it so ah charley and i arewell were thinking abouti mean actually were sort of talking about maybe getting back together ted you heard anything yet me you want me to take care of billy dont say that i dont want to hear you say that what sure i told her youre doing a uh huhyeah uh huhshe said she had a good job was playing a lot of tennis she wanted to know all about billy not for a couple of months the last time i heard from her she was living in san francisco look i know this isnt gon na make any sense okay i mean forget the logic partbut i keep thinking if charley really loved me he wouldnt have let me divorce him no i dont think so three and add some basil no not really i guess its different if you dont have children buti dunno even if charley and i dont live together even if were sleeping with other people even if charley was to marry againhed still be my husband that stuff about till death do you part thats really true lenox hill 77th street between park and lex the emergency number is 3270800 youre sure youre on your own understand ive got enough trouble raising my own kid i dont need another one got it all rightokaybut lets get something straight right now i mean im sorry about what happened between you and joanna but its not my problem understand look this is nothing personal but i dont think you can do it i mean what are you going to do about billy what are you going to do ted divorce is a terrible thing i know i went through it youve got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay but ill tell you something you may not want to hear it but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did no maybe she didnt feel like she should have to maybe she felt like if youd been paying any real attention to her to start with maybe you wouldve noticed oh for shits sake ted you are the most selfish human being i have ever met no wonder she said you came first then billy then if there was anything left over she got the scraps what dyou know about how joanna felt you went off to an office every morning and youd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell i meanthings ted joannas very unhappy and ted joanna and i used to talk a lot andwell she told me a lot ofah things about the two of you ted dont be so hostile ohmygod didnt she say anything she mustve said something ted all i wanted to know

found why what girl but there is no pattern theres no connection at all among these places or the computers wouldve nailed it theyre even found in random order desperately random what does he mean hes here ardelia the worst part the thing thats making me crazy is that bill is right in front of me only i cant see him lecter said everything i need to catch him is right here in these pages it would be rude and he wouldnt get to ask any more questions no he wont come after me somebodys coaching her theyre trying to make him see catherine as a person not just an object boy is that smart pleading with a crazy man with come all over my face thanks ardelia whatd i do never cock just squeeze i will i promise sometimes ill need the big fingerprint kit and the onetoone polaroid the cu 5 with film packs and batteries where shut up the other officers will be here any minute youre perfectly safe now catherine listen to me i have to find a rope i have to leave this room just for a minute but ill get you out just be quiet so i can hear shut that dog up is there a ladder is there a rope youre all right where is he fbi catherine youre safe dr chilton i told you this is just routine followup on the raspail case but then i wouldve missed the pleasure of your company dr chilton if lecter feels youre his enemy as youve said then maybe ill have more luck by myself what do you think i understand i graduated magna from uva doctor its not a charm school how do you mean dr chilton im sure its a great town dr chilton but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon but then he had to cover up make her seem just like all the rest of them thats what lecter was hinting maybe he lives in this this belvedere ohio too maybe he saw her every day and killed her sort of spontaneously maybe he just meant to give her a 7up and talk about the choir but then yes sir i can find it by myself sir doesnt this william rubin strike you as i dont know kind of vague mr krendler dr lecter trusts me or at least he used to if i could just i need the id to fly with my gun the gun belongs in quantico sir mr crawford instructed me not yet just wait for me maybe in about two seconds mr yow oh mr yow it looks like somebody is sitting in this car that wasnt me okay mr yow good idea mr yow if this door should fall down ha ha or anything else would you be kind enough to call this number its our baltimore field office they know youre here with me do you understand i wont disturb anything mr yow i promise be gone before you know it did she leave any records here tax or business records maybe a list of employees mr gordon did you take over this place after mrs lippman died i think we may be yes thanks mr gordon did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs lippman im investigating the death of fredrica bimmel who are you please excuse me but i really do need to talk to you this was mrs lippmans house did you know her yes sir thank you sir yes sir ill do my best chicagos only about 400 miles from here i could be there in sewing sir thats great news but how where thats why theyre all so big because he needs a lot of skin he keeps them alive to starve them awhile to loosen their skin so that hes making himself a woman suit mr crawford out of real women and he can sew this guy hes really skilled a dressmaker or a tailor hes going to kill her mr crawford this morning or maybe at noon but today and belvederes our last chance im flying there right now unless you stop me you want my id here take it but i just became a private citizen i can go anywhere i want to but not from this angle not thinking he knew her youve got to send me you do until six pm all his victims are women his obsession is women he lives to hunt women but not one women is hunting him except me i can walk in a womans room and know three times as much about her as a man would i have to go to belvedere mr crawford can those cops down there handle dr lecter i lied to lecter ill need some kind of peace offering can i get the drawings from his cell lecter is still the key i know he is whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before if you didnt want me chasing him you shouldnt have taken me to that funeral home are you in trouble over this mr crawford can senator martin do something to you chilton has killed her hasnt he that slimy little bastard we were so close with lecter and now her last chance is gone youll back me up with some paperwork then ill try but wouldnt this have more weight coming from the senator herself transfer to a new prison with a view of trees he said or even water can we swing that i think he means it this time i think hell deal but if he knew we have so little time hes already offered to help what would happen if we just showed our cards asked him for bill raspail was killed by the same man whos killing these girls and lecter knows him maybe even treated him you think so too dont you or youd never have sent me to that asylum then have the lab check raspails head dr lecters patient have them probe his softpalette tissues theyll find another cocoon im wondering if hes done that before placed a cocoon or an insect it would be easy to miss in an autopsy especially with a floater can we check back on that it matters mr crawford other cops know who you are they look at you to see how to act it matters i dont know i didnt see those on any of the other girls well shes not local her ears are pierced three times each and shes wearing green glitter nail polish looks like town to me he starts this buzzing in me in my head he makes me feel violated you used me mr crawford you knew you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this but you werent up front with me you sent me in to him naked you havent said a word today about that garage or what i found there like i have a knack for dr lecter hes got a real taste for it now and hes getting better at his work what he does with them takes privacy time tools hes in his 30s or 40s hes got real physical strength but combined with an older mans selfcontrol hes cautious precise never impulsive this wont end in suicide like they often do hes a white male serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group and hes not a drifter hes got his own house somewhere not an apartment theres no correlation at all between where theyre kidnapped and where theyre found what if what if you trace the heaviesttraffic routes backwards from the dump sites do they converge at all im here sir i just i dont know how to feel about it murdered how sir what is it theres something youre not telling me to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday but sir sir thats a field job its outside the scope of my assignment and ive got a test tomorrow on i spent all evening on the mainframe lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories prior to capture no record of anyone named mofet but split city sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce i tracked it down in the librarys catalogue of national yellow pages its a ministorage facility outside baltimore where lecter had his practice right down to the kleenex i used sir why is something wrong its all there sir practically verbatim and what is that sir yes sir yes well okay right im glad for the chance sir but why me whos the subject not yet i hope so they havent posted anything good morning mr crawford dr lecter and theres no way no natural way these couldve wound up in the bodies not lately but maybe someday i try to be a student dr pilcher sometimes you do i think so where does mrs lippman live id like to talk to her did you ever work with her stacy did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb or john grant do you think she couldve had a friend you didnt know about you know i cant make that promise dr lecter starling yes ill tell you tell me his name dr lecter yes i dont know i dont know yes i didnt get more than a few miles before the sheriffs car found me the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman i never saw the ranch again i dont know i had no food or water it was very cold i thought if i can even save just one but he got so heavy so heavy i took one lamb and i ran away as fast as i could no first i tried to free them i opened the gate of their pen but they wouldnt run they just stood there confused they wouldnt run yes they were screaming got dressed without turning on the light i went downstairs outside i heard a strange sound early still dark and one morning i just ran away later listen ill dr lecter when theres time ill all right then tell me how no we just anger social resentment sexual frus he kills w then tell me how i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore or starting to tell me the rest now dr lecter you find out everything you couldnt have talked with this william rubin even once and come out knowing so little about him you made him up didnt you nobody sent me i came on my own i thought you might want your drawings back just until you get your view yes doctor please how would he test on what basis would they reject him you said i was very close to the way wed catch him no quid pro quo doctor no i ran away two months horses and sheep i went to live with my mothers cousin and her husband in montana they had a ranch no tell me why dr lecter theres no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence transsexuals are very passive quid pro quo doctor no he was strong he lasted almost a month my mother died when i was very young so my father had become the whole world to me after he left me i had nobody i was ten years old he was a town marshal one night he surprised two burglars coming out the back of a drugstore they shot him the death of my father go doctor thats just part of the island it has a very nice beach terns nest there a moth how did you predict that she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat that hasnt been made public yet we dont know what is means they all were yes by the book hes a sadist i was your choice dr lecter you chose to speak to me would you prefer someone else now or perhaps you dont think you can help us buffalo bill bill killed him all those years ago thats impossible who killed your patient who killed raspail doctor you know dont you i dont know is it that doesnt interest me doctor and its the sort of thing miggs would ask i never thought about it i dont know next time ill have to check because you werent wasting my time scared at first then exhilarated wouldnt it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find if you didnt kill him then who did why dont you tell me about miss mofet you wanted me to find him or do i have to wait for the lab why do you know something about him how did its nothing a scratch whats that dr lecter then please do this test for me and the questionnaire reasonably so yes you see a lot dr lecter but are you strong enough to point that high powered perception at yourself how about it look at yourself and write down the truth or maybe youre afraid to no i only hoped that your knowledge no you ate yours it excites him most serial killers keep some sort of trophies ill tell you if youll look at this form it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide they said this one likes to skin his humps partially yes but doctor thats an active case im not involved if five so far no i came because we need im only asking you to look at this doctor either you will or you wont dr lecter if youd please consider all that detail just from memory did you do those drawings doctor maybe theyll catch up yes he said i can smell your cunt were talking about psychology doctor not the bureau can you decide for yourself whether or not im qualified im still in training at the academy i am yes doctor we have a hard problem in psychological profiling i want to ask for your help with a questionnairewhere will we go i have nothing to go back for alice never doubt what you are doing yes i want you to go our father did you see my father are we safe what is it no i will find you what would you have me do theyre going to hang you why didnt you leave when you had the chance what are you looking at mr poe mr poe much further on the contrary it is more deeply stirring to my blood than any imagining could possibly have been you are right mr poe we do not understand what is happening here and it is not as i imagined it would be thinking of it in boston and london in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison why were those people living in this defenseless place and what were the consequentialities of european culture you didnt bother with how did you learn english im sorry thank you so much were a breed apart and we make no sense why did they turn back what he did your father you were acting for our benefit and i apologize i misunderstood you you knew them why didnt you bury those people i will not i have seen the face of war before mr poe but never war made on women and children and almost as cruel is your indifference though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a christian burial yes i do i know exactly what i am saying and if it is sedition then i am guilty of sedition too justice if thats justice then the sooner french guns blow the english army out of america the better it will be for these people he knew the consequences and he stayed are those the actions of a criminal duncan do something there was no letter there was none when how what are they

in something besides yourself well it shattered your faith in everything like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic no of course not but i think now that this has happened a lot of things can start to come out i dont know in a way im glad it all happened thank god he did im still shaking when did they find her what thats horrible i spaced out hey what are you doing here in the middle of the day oh peter youre going to pursue this now that youre on tv youre a magnet for all the wackos out there did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings peter where are you you know there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why were losing daylight quarks and dark matter things like that even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast you know i cant believe its already starting to get dark so early sushi i must really be slacking off hungry bad you never said anything to me its great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet howd your interview go im sure you charmed the hell out of sally i missed you eight that okay you know i made a reservation at marcos for peters birthday dinner but maybe you should cater it you wearing a watch father frustrating form over content everythings so retro peter are you okayyou heard voices you know you did and was he in distress when you opened the door or was he sitting here relaxed at this table what did you hear dr allen could you please tell mr kelson what you heard as you tried to enter mr birdsons room youll do it father i have nowhere else to stay i hope so he will he has great faith if you really believe in god why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real you werent there give me time to get some proof father please dont die so i guess satan lost satan is the weak one so if christ won that means what does that mean father that satan we won because christtriumphed over satan sowe won what do you mean dont worry father thank god youre better i really need your help weve only got a few more hours father im right here you wouldnt last five minutes why are you doing this to me oh thank you thank you so much i didnt know what else to do peterpeter kelson well i know hes come here before thirteen the last time can you believe it this is how he says goodbye i took one of those home pregnancy tests but i dont want to tell him im rh negative my blood type is negative if hes rh positive ill have to terminate hi id like to make an appointment for peter kelson oh peter not a lot book five deuteronomy chapter seven verse five but this shall you deal with them you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire he was trying to tell me something thats his i dont know his grounding phrase for me together no matter what hes been repeating that since birdsons exorcism i looked in every passage in the bible and theres nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything ill be all right peter at the very end i think father was back i saw it in his eyes you have to be experienced to do this just wait outside otherwise you risk killing him maybe i should check lareauxs book its in the car be right back dont go anywhere what are these only your body will remain i believe your soul will be at peace if we kill you satan cant stay until it happens youre still a human being maybe thats my problem i know it is right after my parents died i went to the beach i was in the water everything was calm and then one of those really big waves hit me hard pulled me straight to the bottom i struggled and finally ran out of air if it hadnt been for my sister who pulled me out i wouldve drowned legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me i was desperate i knew you wrote about murders i needed a way in you have to say that im scared im slipping back i see things my worst fears you need to know something peter i was possessed once like birdson it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it sometimes when i feel weak i have thesevisions comfort theres nothing else here he couldnt stop us and thats how he was punished peter what time were you born itll happen at the exact time of your birth your 33rd birthday the transformation will be a perversion of christs rising from the dead townsend discovered it in one of lareauxs books whens your birthday peter let go of the chair get up nothing yet we needed to know all we could the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out townsend he had some of fathers books i dont know i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way i dont know if it works the same way in this instance i dont even know when its going to happen peter i believe your baptism was perverted look at your certificate your mother was the only witness to it your bloodtype doesnt match who you thought your father was peterim sorry then why are you here peter your bloodtype is ab negative theres no way your birth father can be o positive you father is not who you think he is do you know your parents blood types seven years one baptism hes your mothers only brother the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford you were not baptized at least i dont believe it was christian your baptism was performed by your uncle james mckenzie theres no reason why you should this has been planned from your birth you fit all the criteria that we know of never baptized born of incest devoid of faith youre about to become the antichrist who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world i know this sounds crazy i understand check your parents blood types are you sure your parents are your birth parents youre already contaminated its why you couldnt hear the tape theres probably a pentacle near your bed to sanctify you the good outwitting the bad its like birdson had a split personality if youre possessed you cant reveal anything satan wants hidden unless you trick him its true birdson knew your name he was writing it in numerical code it wasnt easy but i figured it out it spelled your name at the exorcism birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man you are that man peter townsend believed just as god became man in christ so satan will assume human form i believe it too please the children peter please thats their explanation you might not believe me i had to youre right i mustve made a mistake youre sure there was nothing what do you mean sowhat did you think of the tape well i think its very simple heres a tape of birdsons exorcism ill be at the public library tomorrow at 2 if you want to meet him on television you seemed so sure of yourself if youre really that confident youd be willing to let someone prove you wrong an exorcism was just held for birdson it failed disastrously which means theres still a demonic spirit present in his body i was wondering perhaps youd like to go meet henry hes pretty amazing last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed you realize how rarely they make that ruling do you remember henry birdson the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family in the end the jury saw it my way i murdered my parents mr kelson and while they deserved it i still went to confession the following sunday and i also believe in god and the devil in fact i know they exist what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e and also that you said that malignant narcissism was not evil i saw you on television yesterday you were brilliant peter kelson oh my god look john im facing it you cant back out on me now we need to be sure well see father frank in the morning theres nothing to be done until then we need all the help we can get ive filed a report with father frank ill explain everything later can you meet me tonight i know who he is good seeing you againgood of you to stop by its detective smythe you watch one day ill hit the jackpot get the big house car clothes ill have more money than god sometimes i can just feel the numbers i plan to you want a tipwhen i said quincy could do better i was thinking about you you had your coaches and your father for that stuff it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games thats ridiculous i dont remember that dont tell me you arent ashamed of that because i know oh yes the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife so youre angry with me because youre standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you child please ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say youre the one always turning your nose up at me what do you want me to tell you monica to go beat that girl up to go have sex with him im not going to do that yes i believe thinking of other people is important and yes id rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot if that makes me too prissy for you too bad dont curse you didnt want my opinion in the first place so why even ask find out where theyre registered and send them a gift his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago he could do a lot better if you ask me to that stewardess how is he i can manage hi whenever you lose you get this attitude but its just a game hes still at the bank dont be defensive im just surprised to see you monica what are you doing here tonight dont worry about yesterdays game the recruiters or anything else i just want you to enjoy being beautiful will you do that nothing so good luck sure in between all the other things i have to do child take a bite taste this watch your mouth thats not funny i dont know why i keep hoping youll grow out of this tomboy thing fine you dont like this one which one would you rather wear im lucky i found it someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage oh all that work monica what did you do okay the blue how is she alright looking the way she does she needs to stop running around like a little boy okay you might want to put a jacket on him its getting cold so youre still breastfeeding so that means its alright for you to act like that and if you want a thicker base you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour i just need to lay down ive been running around all day when youre done can you make sure she brushes her teeth really well come on then well no but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older its definitely something i want to do since you love to cook maybe its something we can talk about oh me too i used to cook for my friends parties and things back in atlanta well thanks again this was really nice of you until the black family down the street became the black family next doorhes fine the doctor said it was okay anyway im still trying to lose some of this baby fat whatd you do but you use potato are you okay yeah once i cut them off why too many times hey you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight let me worry about your date if you were tore up i would not be claiming you trust you do i told him you looked like me and hes fine girl this brother from my college no i know i found you someone so whats going on with the spring dance you have a date yet just try and chill a little bit alright you need to shes alone in this house all day taking care of dad and your ungrateful behind like you dont give her a hard time moms going to hate it that too tightwhat are you talking about it mattered mom thats all you cared about i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two whats ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his womans home cooking and ironing his drawers i do you never stood up for yourself ever if i was ashamed it was because of that i remember when i was eight years old you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal all youd let me and lena do was set the table and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas and you didnt say anything you just threw the whole meal into some tupperware and tossed it in the fridge thats not it im angry because i want a mother not martha stewart because youre pushing me to be something im not i wasnt lena i didnt care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume no i dont so thats why we cant get along because id rather shoot a dumb jump shot there you go i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy whatever so what do i do maybe she is yeah you met her engaged yeah cant wait to see him i just saw quincy need any help what dad around didnt know i needed a reason to come home what what you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say i cant eat before a game well thats what you think isnt it cause id rather wear a jersey than an apron i wont im a lesbian nothing pants i hate it ah mom nothing its justit seems like youre always yelling at me i thought sidras ankle was okay for next game thanks coach what i can take it wait uhhuh my mouth is kinda dry sorry huh sort of oh sorry youre cold they ever love you back you ever been in love i dont know how to walk in heels yeah right oh great howd you get him to say yes hes in college damn lena who is he mom tell you to do this found im not some charity case yeah brothers are lined up at my locker no ones forcing her just cause i dont kiss her booty like you always on my ass anyway no you shoot like a girl that tends to happen when youre the bosss daughter dad what are you doing here chances are theres still a chance the coach from usc is going to be at the championship what i was just showing emotion the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench dad you have to talk to coach for me you ever think about going back just not my type i guess i wouldnt know hows that been just like that you mean my championship trophy my bad how do you say youre dreaming in italian whats up sidra whats that i know thanks but whats up didnt have to try very hard i was just playing ball thanks sidra whats up with that coach hates me doesnt she if i lose ill buy you a wedding present so if i win its because deep down you know youre about to make the biggest mistake of your life and deep down your want me to stop you you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to i know why you broke up with me in college and not that what you did wasnt messed up but what i did was too so if you forgive me ill forgive you so youre gon na bitch up your heart one game oneonone ill play you better late than never right then why are you so upset i know i probably should have said it two weeks ago what im trying to say is ive loved you since i was eleven and the shit wont go away its not fun for me anymore because youre missing from basketball you asked me what was missing we need to talk it doesnt matter alright just leave it alone something was just missing why do you keep asking me that its a trip you know when youre a kid you see the life you want and it never crosses your mind that its not gon na turn out that way wow like what youre serious and you tore up your knee

to be born of nobility and i was right you better oh paul when ian realized that the reason theyd buried misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma what you said you can make it so they got ta turn the page you know i got ta know will she live i got ta know will he catch the killer i got ta see how this chapter ends you said it i dont usually buy that magazine i only got it cause they were interviewing you the got ta remember you talked about it in playboy magazine you said theres a million things you cant do in this world you cant hit a curve ball you cant fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work but theres one thing you always have and thats the power of the got ta you canyou have the got ta dont be silly of course you can whats the matter paul you havent written a word but not you not with my misery remember ian did ride for dr cleary at the end of the last book but his horse fell jumping that fence and ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor so there couldnt have been any experimental blood transfusion that saved her life misery was buried in the ground at the end paul so youll have to start there he didnt get out of the cockadoodie car i know that mister manthey also call them serials im not stupid you know anyway my favorite was rocket man and once it was a nobrakes chapter the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned andi was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe i was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was rocket man trying to get out and here came the cliff and just before the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered but i didnt cheer i stood right up and started shouting this isnt what happened last weekhave you all got amnesiathey just cheated usthis wasnt fair thats rightwhen i was growing up in bakersfield my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays paul what youve written just isnt fair paul its not worthy of you throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me you can leave that in im sorry paul this is all wrong youll have to do it over again dont be silly youll be brilliant think of me as your inspiration here in case you think of any ideas itll only take a second poor dear lets get you back in bed and ill get them for you paul youre dripping with perspiration your color is very hecticwhat have you been doing whats the matter ill

slippers well it does smudge after allisnt that fascinating but mine cost the most so i dont see how it could smudge youfooler did i do good and i got a great deal on this fifty pound clunkeron account of its missing an n i told the saleslady n was one of the letters in my favorite writers name dont worry about that youll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work i expect nothing less than your masterpiece yes it will be a book in my honor for saving your life and nursing you back to health ill be the first one to read it oh paul youre going to make me the envy of the whole world i know you didnt mean it when you killed her and now youll make it right oh but paul i dont think i know now that youve gotten rid of that nasty manuscript you can go back to doing what youre great at youre going to write a new novel your greatest achievement ever miserys return thats the big surprise your new studioafter all writers do need a place to work now dont josh this is a very big day for you paul here you just sit tight and ill set everything up and look what ive got for you an electric razor so you can shave yourself now see isnt this nice yeah well its a theory heres your novril how does tuna casserole sound for dinner i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year people say it has something to do with the ozone layer what do you think as long as it does exist your mind wont ever be free i think you should light the match paul oh paul this isnt about money its about decency and purity its about gods values i know this is the only copy paul when you were twentyfour you wrote your first book and you didnt make a copy because you didnt think anybody would take it seriously but they did and ever since youve never made any copies because youre superstitiousits why you always come back to the silver creek lodge you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago so youve indicated do it then light the match paul i know this may be difficult for you but its for the best yes yes but this time i thought clearly i asked god about you and god said i delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way ill get you everything you want but you must listen first sometimes my thinking is a little muddy i accept that its why i couldnt remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in denver youre such a kidder i have a big surprise for you but first theres something you must do what are you doing on the floor its my fault if id had a proper hospital bed this never would have happened here let me help you back in i know this hurts but itll only take a few seconds there you go comfy she slipped away she slipped away she didnt just slip away you did it you did it you did it you did it you murdered my misery then who did i dont want her spirit i want her and you murdered her youyou dirty bird she cant be dead misery chastain can not be dead how could you of course ill like it miserys about to have her child whats it gon na be a boy or a girl ooh dont tell me id love to stay here and chat but im right at the end and i got ta find out what happens it boils down to respect people just dont respect the institution of marriage any more they have no sense of real commitment dont get me wrong im not against marriage per se but it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again no problem done i just kept reading them over and over i know when i finish this one and ive only got two chapters to go ill just turn right to the front page and start reading it again i dont know about you but what i did to get through it was i dove into workdays nightsnight shifts can be lonely at a hospital i did a lot of reading that was hen i first discovered misery she made me so happy she made me forget all my problems course i suppose you had a little something to do with that too for a while i thought i might go crazy yeah that and miserys childthose are the only two divine things ever in this world im on page threehundred now paul and its better than perfectits divine whats the ceiling that dago painted this farm was getting kind of dreary what with just the few cows and chickens and me but when i got misery here everything changedshe just makes me smile so yes i told you i was your number one fan i thought it was time you two should meet paul say hello to my favorite beast in all the world my sow misery thank you so much i knew it i knew it wasnt true boy how do they get away with printing stuff like that i dont mean to pry but ive read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials and i said it cant be true paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that no no it isnt its oh pooh i cant think of any words would great be insulting i made you my specialityscrambled eggs a la wilkes and im on page 75 your agent said she would tell her you were okay but im afraid youll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself its like a visit from my oldest dearest friend well mines still out but the ones in town were working just fine i called that agent of yours oh paul i peeked at the very beginning what a wonderful first pagejust to read the name misery chastain the one to town is but thats about it i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon i told him who you were and what had happened he said as long as theres no infection youre not in any danger and as soon as the road to the hospital is open theyll send an ambulance for you they had it at the store paul there was a whole batch of them there as soon as i saw it i slammed my money down i got the first copy oh im sorry i didnt mean to wake you it has no nobility the swearing paul there i said it well its brilliantly written but then everything you write is brilliant oh its ridiculous who am i to make a criticism to someone like you nothing oh like i could do that whats it about whats your new book called youll never realize what a rare treat youve given me if you wouldnt mind it shouldnt be too much longer once the roads are open the linesll be up in no time if you give me their numbers ill keep trying them for you could i ask you a favor i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and and i wondered if maybe and youre very brilliant and you must be a good man or you could never have created such a wondrous loving creature as misery chastain like a baby all done lucky for you i did lucky for me too because now youre alive and you can write more books oh paul ive read everything of yours but the misery novels dont move nowwouldnt want to hurt this neck well the other afternoon i was on my way home and there you were leaving the lodge and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming well it wasnt any secret to me that you were staying at the silver creek seeing as how im your number one fan and all some nights id just tool on down there sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin and id try to imagine what was going on in the room of the worlds greatest writer no it wasnt a miracle at all in a way i was following you of course you will and your arm will be fine too your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly but i finally popped it back in there but what im most proud of is the work i did on those legs considering what i had around the house i dont think theres a doctor who could have done any better your legs just sing grand opera when you move dont they its not going to hurt forever paul i promise you the blizzard was too strong i couldnt risk trying to get you there i tried calling but the phone lines are down theyre called novriltheyre for your pain here youve been here two days youre gon na be okay my name is annie wilkes and im shhh were just outside silver creeki appreciate that thanks a lot i hate that i made this calltell me im

and they said he checked out five days ago isnt that a little strange im sure you know pauls been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books yes he is yes im a literary agent and i feel like a fool calling you but i think one of my clients paul sheldon might be in some kind of trouble i thought you were over it now youve hurt me paul paul since you brought her up i have to ask you this or id be drummed out of the agents union what about a nonfiction book the truth about what went on in that house i thought youd be thrilled youre being taken seriously and my contacts at time

copy did they win im glad to hear that paul i really am but you have to knowwhen your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine theyre not going to say ooh good paul sheldon can finally write what weve always wanted an esoteric semi autobiographical character study no no misery chastain put braces on your daughters teeth and is putting her through college bought you two houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she get you go and kill her not a bad business this thing would still be growing too the first printing order on miserys child was the most everover

matter browns responsibilities are onerous enough already he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed the smokingroom will be closed and the lights put out at twelve oclock it is quite late enough it is a disgusting habit bertie it should be discouraged i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box least of all my son it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave cold is good is that not so dr jenner no dinners bertie why are you dressed for outdoors gesture yes yes it was you should never have gone out in such foul weather then why send me back to them i will not hear any more about my safety you made me a promise and now you have broken it you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most you stand there and tell me it is my duty after all you promised me i can not believe you are saying this you who i have relied on all this time duty you talk about duty the queen forbids it i can not allow it because i can not live without you without you i can not find the strength to be who i must be please i do not accept yes has someone seen to those bruises i was told you were in a fight john the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated im sure am i not safe enough with you john dear me youll be telling me to watch what i eat next must they always follow us what is it john john to keep out the cold i hope they didnt go to any trouble john what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson of course i shall say what i have to say i always do i do not do it for others but ponsonby thinks they are good his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject he has been attending at balmoral for many years sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming i am told so i am thinking of publishing my highland journals craobhangeanmchno how can i possibly say that with a straight face those over there there what are those yes it is a fine spot for a bench is it not sir henry is not alone they all wish it the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank he thought so yes prince albert was going to build a bench here he thought it one of the best views in osborne the queen will ride out if and when she chooses then why do you persist in doing it you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so mr brown yes that will be company for you yes you have a brother in service here do you not i forget his name my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you he would have approved i am sure of my calling on you in this way i trust it does not inconvenience you too much your family sent cards it was much appreciated and the pony you are well you are here safely mr brown i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral this is my good john brown i stay here because i am happy is that such a terrible crime i never thought to be bullied by you mr disraeli you i thought understood a widows grief is that not enough then they may read about me but i lack your prose mr disraeli how ill is he why was i not informed no you are mistaken prince albert my husband had typhoid fever i asked what was wrong with my son i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy why am i being lectured in this way cold is good whom why was i not told earlier how long has he been this sick has he been hurt unwell why well i made no request to go out riding today how long has he been there what is he doing there just them please tell the princess and other signatories to this letter that the queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to answer for her comfort do i make myself clear what do they want my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person from whom what is it is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors i am not a fool i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends sometimes i feel that brown is all i have left of albert and now they attack brown too noone should think themselves wiser than me it is not for any of the queens subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning it is the queens sorrow that keeps her secluded it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely why not who told them that read it read it and now i am back we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant it was most agreeable no i shall be out walking why please make sure it does not happen again sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard i have no wish to go riding what is the matter with him then why are you not with him why is he not here where is my son thats a very pretty shawl you are wearing alex silk suits you well but you are not eating enough one must not let vanity overrule ones appetitethe donor maybe hes alive inside the game maybe hes not dead dead but how can it change every time how do you do that whats the question mark we vere thinking there might be tricks you know surprises that youd worked into the game were having some problems with arcade theres something wrong with arcade the games alive somehow neither are we somethings wrong with the game mr difford its the game arcade howd you know it was us but you always lie so you didnt come from there that means the city on the left must be the city of truth liar did you come from the city on the left or the city on the right did you play arcade last night everybodys sick huh its fifteen after we always meet here you know that has anyone seen greg he thinks im sublimating i just thought of something if we came back from the game what if arcade did too never been on a snowboard there never is one of them anyway did you see it the screamer we dont have a choice screamer look around our times up check your readout there yeah thats what worries me the clocks already ticking the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level once we get all the keys we can unlock arcades heart and then youve got the schematics check got it yeah well i figure these are unusual circumstances one in case you feel it its different this time i already have a boyfriend nick what and what if something happens to you am i suppose to go in after you alone yes i am yes it does dont you see we have to play by the rules thats what it wants put in a quarter what are you looking for you didnt hear me dantes inferno you got the schematics i cant believe you made it what are you going to do no im not virgin sacrifices i was afraid youd say that and beat it at its own game they made arcade its still a game right it thinks like a game maybe it still has to play by the rules someone had to program it in the first place didnt they slipstream then where do we go the police then anywhere we have to stop it from getting out but then it hits the relay stations like the fractals nick what is it what where do we go we cant change the channel lets go around back this is like a movie or something i mean am i paranoid or what lauries she thought benz was at school if theyre sick great but lets make sure come on nick we have to find out whats happened to them i think theyre gone sure because i didnt know where else to go all of them somethings happened to them call the others laurie benz it turned itself back on nick see men always do this quiet down honey chill out take a valium im not a fucking idiot nick i did not imagine it so how did it know my name then it is no wait just listen i hooked it up earlier tonight and it said my name as soon as i turned it on nick it said my name how could it know and then i asked it where greg was and it said in here no look i know youre not going to believe me but listen anyway i think the games alive somehow turn if off can you turn off the game greg never came home a few hours is one thing nick but this is different somethings happened to him funny im coming over no in person now i have to talk to you listen to me greg never came home i think the game has something to do with it nick hello but he was playing the game i mean you saw him yeah so where is he well its a long story go for it and then keep on driving im okay i know oh godoh god in this world wrong is right which way then well go home thought so how did you get here did you play the game im thinking think i want to go to the city of truth and the truth teller is

spa let me rephrase that do you get nervous in small confined spaces its been awhile ill take your word a trademark move dont touch it how about well youve been introduced to the symphonic range of garden sports all little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit represents a packing challenge but theres fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit so your honeymoon is exactly where most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding just to top it off luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere is all im s dont you have to be somewh thats why michael and i were the wrong fit right from the start what else did he tell you i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress which was the disqualifying factor uh how about promoting a bridesmaid someone you know for at least fortyfive minutes you want a menage on your wedding night can you watch the road excuse me you need a few dollars well were you are uso right what a nerve on that guy bring my dress to church huh excuse me its jules you guys havent had a call from say kimberly have you i saw the show right and then it didnt want to come off exactly well see that was a reflex to see if it would unless he has a hump i need to make some calls could i use your office nobody has so far i told him get the important stuff kims ring ill collect the inconsequentials then it could all come out sooner or later nobody should be in on this just you and me or more correctly i hes too proud to beg for help and if you wait till this comes out your offer will be like charity completely humiliating hes said some things over the past few weeks look this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job i think hes been fired its a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michaels boss sir this is important havent you ever in your life cut one corner to make something important turn out right is anybody watching i think youre making a mistake sir nice meeting you too walt i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question me yeah and she likes tommy lasorda case closed okay well split up you go to every romantic place you guys have ill go someplace brilliant and the first one who thats little egotistical course if its later rather than sooner id hate to be you at six oclock youve got a lot of explaining to you cant believe youve lost her sooner or later youll find her and youll look in each others eyes and youll see all that love that is so romantic its two weeks why would she come here im so glad you didnt jump on that train before lower actually lower i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum lower the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung i didnt know it would get sent i just wanted you to get mad at kimmy and wrote it yeah im the bad guy dont speak this is the dumbest thing i will ever do so dumb in fact that i cant i dont think shhh the big hurt huh you never want to do that see thats always a costly turnover as they say in the sport biz your one chance for true happiness well it happens oh yeah does that make it right she admits its her fault because shes as chickenshit as you are you morons are made for each other and your point get married apparently but the scotch salmon was so fucking good you decided to stay for brunch i had the craziest dream last night walter and kimmy had asked your boss to if san antonio sweeps sacramento should we take a walk or maybe some food sent up or something maybe tomorrow youll feel dif michael a bad combination what happened maybe you should take the job and dump the girl mike the funny thing is hes offering you a gig youd be stupid to turn down michael what ha maybe its congratulations it means a lot youre right easy come easy go we could use his computer to just email those suckers right ou its just up there right in front of walters yknow computer if memory serves thats my point im up against a deadline isnt there a guard a janitor a fucking cleaning woman ill take a burglar somebodys got ta be in th yes no accents today well we danced to it just like this the night we met ill check i have it on powerbook these days i wouldnt know i never had that many first thoughts me either except for the hot affairs well have twice a year youve been the man in mine well theres a lot of memories to choose from have you if you like you miss her huh well youve got the rest of your lives you keep saying that like i said dazzling michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun michael never can tell you need a babysitter thats what im here for boy those were the days i switched that around when you werent looking i never eat when im serene still alls fair in love and w i guess youre right that would be deceitful manipulative controlling emascula i mean walter owns the sox cable sports most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t all of it shes leaving her family her friends everything she knows shes putting her career on hold and she seems a pretty ambitious driven kind of pers pretty amazing girl youve got make that kind of sacrifice should i whistle down a cab the vespa me hanging on behind in the rain all night where was that florence huh gim me like eight and nine off the top ten list can that kind of defect be passed on genetically waiter check please is there a coup de grace in here somewh quite the little eccentric endearingly absentminded whats next hate that such as i just admire your maturity thats all i mean there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring day after day year after year best everything joe but im going to dance with you whats the sec w well maybe we should talk ab thomas yeh michael its wednesday night you cant possibly be getting married on su youve met her parents well sure well somet well thats great you havent really had anybody since dingbat jennylee yeh well my old machine kept eating messages i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement but finallythats entirely understandable why dont you just drive a stake through my heart i love him that this is all my fault dont you see this must be very very hard on him look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared we settled this and i reneged that wasnt fair i just dont want to freak him out he wont get mad huh hell see right through it exactly what so one almost has to gold dog collars they dont have dogs for the twins what in the world is th but he always says i mean he loves his job i just think youre wrong is all about michaels job stop were embarrassing h its not just clubs this guy always knows the best everything the best guitar store the best beef ribs the best horowitz record was he always like the ju he has you on a pedestal and me in his arms youre enshrined in his heart and memory unassailable which works out great you win and the answer was so simple im not joking i had to face up to all my competitive drives and believe me ive got em youll always be there in his mind the perfect creature he loved for all those y except one but nothing ever could ever did give me a moments pause about this marriage so its sweet of you to be protective and loving him means loving all of this after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults i made a command decision that changed my life but he sure can kiss he sucks soup through his front teeth cigars in bed i broke him on that but the bathrooms a swamp he wears reeboks to dinner tells the same admittedly funny jokes three hundred times his snoring yeah he says its worse than ever that snaffle one it depends if san antonio sweeps sacramento we could start there or phoenix or depending on indiana clevel im excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot hes only there a ye what because im a little understand just my bridal shower and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a onethirty game he said that too you hate weddings you never go not you you wont be comfortable unless youre distinctive the twin part i like to remain impartial in my contempt the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty identical twin debutantes from nashville who

damon bradley i can hardly hear you could you spell that im sure hell be sorry to hear that who should i tell him called this is his fiancee whos this hes not in at the moment can i take a message hello is anybody there i brought you that too there is no us thats not the point and what if i had wanted to yes no it isnt i called off my wedding all because of you gee im flattered what an incredibly romantic gesture cancel the roses ive decided to lie to her instead rational love is not rational are you crazy i would call it unforgivable a little white lie a little white lie well i mightve found him again if i hadnt left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you youre the reason i never met him you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it i cant believe you did that no one had to tell me hes starring in the local play who cares you hired an actor what you want a hint ill give you a hint you are the lowest most despicable most reprehensible form of reptilian swine get out i just need to run up and get my bathing suit yes i am thank you so since i have a few more days of vacation left i was wondering if maybe youd want to do something sometime i mean you know if you dont have other plans no i mean yes im not i decided to call it off well actually it was kind of mutual yeah well anyway i also wanted to tell you im not getting married it seems like ever since i found out about this guy this name ive been kind of crazy like i was on drugs or something no i just came by to apologize hi are you busy no course not no it was more than that it was very generous of you it was very kind i feel like the worlds biggest idiot yeah well how about those old romantic movies with those great stars huh like audrey hepburn how about music you like classical well what about books you like hemingway you got ta love hemingway so were you why are you doing this i dont know if thats such a you were saying what are you doing here thank you peter thank you so much what you too just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs nothing fancy well good good for you oh thats nice you found him i dont know how to thank you hi peter no right now mickey spillane please i need to know tell me he likes to read did he mention anyone in particular why oh no i dont think that would be a good idea wheres positano why not who says i dont love him dont you see were not the ones who are meant to be youre the man of somebody elses dreams no that wasnt a lie that was a mirage so it wasnt real look peter i dont hate you but what we had was an illusion mutual wishful thinking we both wanted to believe it for awhile but it was all founded on a lie what why are you asking me this he wants to marry me doesnt he so is there something wrong with loving somebody whos safe because i know who dwayne is and hes reliable and stable and wants to marry me yes yes if its any of your business yes no i know im limping i stubbed my toe oh come on what kind of an excuse is that how could you do this to me that was before i found out what it was thats not the point what so you say youve been to italy before oh hello uh the scampi sounds good to me too you like shrimp i like shrimp what looks good dont worry about it youre my guest excuse me well to new friends really sure oh faith my names faith yes okay good see you then then you would really would you be willing to have dinner with me any night i was wondering do you have dinner plans i just got here too not yesterday but just now today just a few minutes ago yeah we just got here i mean i just got here im single been here long beautiful place youre damon bradley larry did you rent a car im fine have you seen peter i dont know ive just been thinking maybe this destiny thing is more of a doityourself operation maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for and larry actually no theres not going to be a wedding i didnt expect you back so soon kate is that you so i guess ive got a wedding to go to i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel i spent my whole life waiting for a creep hes a jerk maybe if i kiss him ill feel it maybe i can change him no i think maybe youve been right i think i may have been too critical in the past no ones perfect kate kate thank god youre there i need help my god youre right what if he doesnt like me is damon bradley here hes down in someplace called positano peter says we can make it there by morning yes isnt that amazing im sure and kate thank you for coming thank you for being such a good friend no no you go ahead what the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind may as well start packing our cabs gon na be here in an hour peter peter was a mistake an imposter yeah well obviously it wasnt meant to be ive got fortyeight hours i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened it was a ouija board remember i thought you were the one who didnt think i shouldve come in the first place why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place children are very impressionable you know a little bad luck because ive been kidding myself because i realized you were right from the beginning this whole thing was just a wild goose chase packing hi whereve you been but how could he know he only just met me dont be silly hows a psychiatrist gon na find him like a detective i meant about my idea and then we rent a truck or a car either one and we set up a loudspeaker and we drive through the surrounding areas and we page him okay heres what i think we find out what all the subway stops for that train are the subway systems really not that big in rome we could narrow it down and what right okay its meant to be right this is it right right okay you dont think hes gon na think im too aggressive is he looking at us oh my god where okay okay you join him but first will you ask if hes here sure you did because im the one whos single i told you if he sees me here with another guy hes gon na think im here with another guy i just dont want to send any confusing signals i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe hed notice me first all of the sudden im feeling kind of nervous god i hate blind dates why couldnt we just have arranged marriages in america i dont know i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden right my brother anna im faith you dont know how happy i am to meet you you see im trying to find someone and larry bought himself cologne and you know what i thought then kate i thought i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much i still hope that course he does i dont know kate i just said that im sorry im just on edge im afraid were losing him sorry you expecting somebody you know nothing you know no offense or anything kate but i think im starting to see larrys side of the story right so we shouldve been able to cover more of them i told you a liter was less than a gallon the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy what was i gon na do tell him the truth only its in italian a phone message only were saved oh right maybe theres fingerprints on it a butterfinger wrapper ah ha so maybe his room hasnt been cleaned yet maybe theres something in there that might help us maybe theyll let us go in and take a look around the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago right did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned he fell out just once more so youll be sure to know what to look for ill never meet the man of my dreams we lost him i cant believe we came all this way and hes gone well were here and more importantly hes here well cut back on everything else are you sure what i dont know maybe think of it as an adventure its called the gritty palace now what do we do sure im fine i dont know why i never did this before i mean whats the big deal youre coming with me maybe how hard can it be ill land there ill go to his hotel ill introduce myself and he was on his way to venice right i called the tourist bureau and i mustve called every hotel in the city but i found where hes staying thank you so much no i havent and you forgot about the fortune teller look i know you think this is irresponsible of me but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person of course not i told him i was going to visit a great aunt and dont tell larry either would you stop saying that i need you to do me a really big favor thats where youre wrong i got one nine years ago i just never had an opportunity to use it i have vacation time coming to me its still the new year it was my new years resolution to overcome it the woman at my dry cleaners believes theres no such thing as coincidence its a miracle after all he is my brother and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes but i know him pretty well and i really dont think have you seen him with someone is that bad kate is something the matter i understand kate what do you think of this garter i know youre right yeah i guess youre right i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den oh i dont know i guess its just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be you know like in the movies i know it was look how big it makes me look i look like an alp yes you did why should i ask someone out who i dont want to go out with in the first place no hes never asked me hes a podiatrist or something i dont know kate so hes not my type let me walk you to the elevator i dont know i dont think so no no i wish you didnt have to go so early just that they came out of somebodys experience is all but somebody wrote those songs is everything okay metaphorically i still dont have an amana freezer i dont have an amana freezer dont tell me oprah did a show scientologist just moved in with his girlfriend no he smokes i dont believe in statistics yeah hes around somewherelook she wasnt a relative okay i dont know who she is of course not no she wasnt my sister yes but he was having an affair no no really she thinks hes here even though shes never met him even though shes never laid eyes on him so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams shes trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker my friend has lost her fucking mind hes gone he told me what happened he just left for the airport what about larry well i ought to be getting home anyway the kidsll be back from camp soon the house is probably a mess oh well i realized if youre getting married youre gon na be needing the maid of honor right uh huh so when you couldve found one in america yup yes he is or maybe itll turn him back into a toad i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldnt need to change and he is living proof not only is he a mommas boy and a fascist he says nuculear and irregardless uh huh okay well be there how is he anyway faith im kidding is this how you plan to get what you want from life when you finally find it you turn and run away from it it means youre a completely worthless excuse for a human being and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable whatareyoudoing joan collins stayed here amazing peter found him ill be back before you leave you sure youll be okay im just not ready to go home quite yet thats all who said i was going what about peter and a fortune teller i know but so youre just quitting just like that okay a lot of bad luck but that means the odds are probably in your favor now this is no time to give up so youve had a little bad luck why sightseeing whatre you doing hiiii men have ways yeah sociopaths theyre able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that no like a psychiatrist i think its time we got some professional help that was really sweet and then what faith well nobody can say we didnt try good luck faith faith so far youve trailed the man halfway around the globe at this point i dont think another fifteen feet is gon na tip the scales nope hes sitting in the fourth booth down on the left hand side with his back to us hes wearing a navy jacket if you turn around you can see part of his right elbow hes heeeeeerrre not if you dont count the sixth grade i never even got to be single well how come were always looking for guys for you so whats in a name i wan na join him i dont see why we cant join him youve travelled over six thousand miles and now youre gon na play hard to get youre right at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself smile whats she saying what did you say to her her brother polo he went out and bought himself mens cologne the other day did i tell you that that was a long time ago you know when larry and i got married i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early people talk about spending their lives together how many of them really get to but maybe i was wrong maybe sooner or later everything wears out you think he misses me at all so what exactly is larrys side of the story anyway well you dont have to get snippy with me whats that supposed to mean im hungry we wouldve had enough gas to get us there if you hadnt gotten us lost besides a kilometer is less than a mile couldnt we just have taken a train your brother only what what is it were not looking to arrest the man faith were trying to locate him a rich possibly fat slob whatd you find so i just got a dial tone i dont think he understood what you were saying whats the airport number you cant really blame him for being upset it was an armani suit what are you doing faith ive seen it already okay if i spot somebody whos got a head thats an eighth of an inch around standing underneath a tuba ill recognize him from the photo otherwise im telling you its not gon na do me any good you and the other 99 of the women in the world you gave it your best shot you tried yes cathy lee crosby stayed here of the rich and famous of which we are neither are you out of your mind we cant afford this this is a lifestyles hotel gritty is this gon na be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who dont believe in deodorant the book said they have boats that are like taxis vaporettos whats the name of the place were staying again you okay i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies live happily ever after a foreign land full of millions of italian men speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin youre just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets my god you have i cant believe we did this do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days does dwayne know about this because you were afraid to fly you dont have a passport what about your job but its july its a coincidence no i can just tell i think hes having an affair larry brought me flowers last night i mean just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that its all supposed to be perfect well guess what it isnt not for you not for anybody people have problems insecurities flaws and you have to learn to compromise to overlook to forgive its not settling faith its life real life let me tell you something about love there are no prince charmings there are no glass slippers love is hard work but one day you wake up and realize youve been had of course life isnt like the movies thats why there are movies thats the problem when youre a kid you think life is gon na be like the movies dreams come true the good guys win people live happily ever after all that crap turn but what i think it was sweet of him to pick it out come on its not so bad well i wouldntve if i hadnt thought i was in love he begged me to marry him i didnt even want to marry him if youve never been out with him how do you know you dont want to go out with him why dont you ask him thrills thats what youre waiting for you know how long that lasts besides how do you know have you ever been out with him you dont have any idea whats he do so is he gay is he married yeah well larry and his friends are hungry and i did say id try to pick something up no faith they came out of somebodys imagination so whats your point yes you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds peoples fantasies i think if youre honest with yourself youll admit youve had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime its a metaphor its women who always think theres some unknown out there thats going to be better than whats in front of them and instead wind up with nothing so you got ta be a little flexible look at your brother and me larrys not perfect neither

1934 near gibsland louisiana they put a hundred and eightyseven bullet holes in clyde bonnie parker and the car they were driving bonnie was eating a sandwich i dont recall his hat but ive seen

of course i am i dont have to i dont rob banks i know the difference you were in lompoc usp the federal penitentiary ive delivered people there so basically youve spent half your life in prison it was me i woulda left ol gus on the floor thats funny how many was that why are you famous so whats your name itll be in the paper tomorrow anyway buddy thats his given name must be quite a pal risk his own ass like this you wouldnt have time anyway we come to a roadblock theyll run the car find out in five seconds who it belongs to the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me i believe it youve ruined a nine hundreddollar suit my dad gave me in my bag in the car for your breath you could use it squirt some in your mouth if i could have a little more room im a federal marshal and youre under arrest both of you guys if i didnt know you glenn by tomorrow youd be in jail or dead look at it that way go on but listen glenn if youre lying to me you want to get out of here run itll warm you up gee i wonder why not but you say he hasnt shown up you think he backed out whys that and is foley a part of this ripley you mean the wall street guy but i thought the whole thing was your idea whats going on glenn for the car for aiding and abetting a prison escape and conspiring to do whatever you came here for glenn i know your life history who your friends are where youve been and now it looks like where youre going put your hands on the wheel the two guys you were with that one that isnt maurice miller is it ive seen snoopys mug shot and that didnt look like him youre not another one of those days huh nothing seems to go right glenn are you trying to steal this car glenn take the exit take the next exit wait ihavei you helped him glenn at this point technically i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive so you still have a choice you can help him and risk going down again get cuffed and shackled hope to god you pull a reasonable judge not some hardon or if you want to play it another way look i can understand if you and foley are close foleys not going to make it and if he goes down glenn you go with him do we have a gun in the car last fall i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse twice youre glenn michaels i never forget anyone ive cuffed and shackled no thats not what im thinking you dont remember me do you glenn ill send it to

richard richard norvik i didnt recognize youthank you answer the question please do you have any lesions on your face at this time and its your contention that when the partners were made aware of the lesions they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you youve testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with correct really you could have infected him isnt that right isnt it true you have spent your life pretending to be something youre not so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you as a homosexual one is often forced to conceal ones sexuality is that right do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk while you were employed at wyant wheeler you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual correct do you need a break youd heard of aids in 1984 85 but you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there called aids and that you could contract it through sexual activity when approximately what year did this event take place do men have sex with each other in that theater gay pornographic movies what kind of movies do they show there have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street in general do you take risks in other areas of your life do you take risks you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had an adventurous spirit is that correct thank you were you recently promoted miss burton do you still work at wyant wheeler objection we object your honor it would unfairly influence the jury ill withdraw it mr beckett were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater objection objection fact andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level fact he made a grievous error on a multimillion dollar lawsuit fact he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit fact andrew beckett lied to his employers going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them fact he was successful in his duplicity the partners at wyant wheeler did not know andrew beckett had aids when they fired himnow that you mention it yeah do i have a case why should i rightdoesnt seem like enough to turn

tried to stop you ought to have that the references are to hansard or to newspapers i havent got the actual speeches now youll have to chase them up well see you next week and if dont be silly ill look out some more suez material for you youll be very welcome shell be here next weekend why dont you come too james ill show you the marshes properly if youre lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia its a pity she couldnt make it up here today i do worry about susan have you known her long she hasnt mentioned you i think youll do very well if you like but dont be too modest james the citizens duty is to remember not necessarily to write books you are highly qualified youre a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you here i am lecturing you have some pï½tï½ if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost everyone must have a memory everyone needs to be a historian in this country for example were in danger of losing hardwon freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present to james i remember what it was i was going to say we were talking about forgetfulness the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting and id like you to call me ann since you are a friend of my daughters i think im entitled to call you james dont you think my husband apologises for not joining us its not too cold for you mr penfield good suez was a minefield for both parties i see are you a socialist mr penfield it wasnt much more than a pot boilersuez was very important for our generation i didnt want it to be forgotten and thats why id like to be able to help you but really mr penfield i looked through my notes before you came theyre all very much out of date theres been so much published since i dont think im your man my first husband worked for the bbc i doubt if anyone there remembers him now just another long dead diligent administrator he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbcs independence during the suez crisis one of the few things he was passionate about i became involved too i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez then he died and i loots the will to write it by the time i was over his death other books had been published and it wasnt worth going on hes a little unhappy i hope he wasnt a nuisance tom daddy would like to see you in the garden and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee and remember to say please mr penfield i am sorry to have kept youi know im sorry oh excuse me theres nicholas in your car hes making plans for brighton he thought we could travel down together jeremy phoned this morning yes might remember youre here to talk to my mother i might no its a bit of a madhouse for some reason a lot of my mothers friends specialise in monologues well you should do you think shes invited you up for her sake or for mine did she talk about me i think were ready now thank you and how was norfolk did you get on with my mother you just might i bet thanks for the drink i dont trust anyone thats what comes of working in television two or three years ago i would have stayed and fucked you i have to be up early yes if you like call me at work well you know i called you a taxi damn theyre early that must be rather nice in a way i mean you dont have any it makes me weepy just to remember it so we were fine again and then she got married to matthew whos a womaniser and a bit of a yob but quite nice really makes tv commercials what about yours mummy and i we were more like lovers really or sisters then a couple of years after daddy died and not long after i left oxford she started seeing various men and i was furious i really was upset i stopped going home i never phoned i went round telling everyone how awful her books were and she hardly seemed to notice and that made me angrier then i got a job i was interested in and i started to see lots of men and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand so i wrote her a long letter almost seven pages saying how sorry i was and how i was worried that we were drifting apart and do you know she wrote me a poem a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters yes youre much too old to making a drama out of alienation or whatever you call it youve got to take responsibility for your own happiness thats what i think anyway i think youre exaggerating and if you arent you should jolly well change your job and youre at this third stage my real father well he was a flashback good theory but i like my mother i have no aversions to what she does and the shape of it all it was sort ofshapeless and i didnt like that man i think it went on rather too long i quite liked it i wasnt as enthusiastic as

you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth yes i am a silly girl for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear you never sent the ships dont bother lying it doesnt matter westley will come for me anyway every ship but the four you sent every ship but your four fastest you mean he will come for me my westley will always come for me he is a sailor on the pirate ship revenge promise to return him to his ship if we surrender and i return with you will you promise not to hurt this man oh my sweet westley what have i done you mocked me once never do it again i died that day and what am i nothing you can say will upset me you mock my pain on the high seas your ship attacked and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces youre the dread pirate roberts admit it i know who you are your cruelty reveals everything i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream he knows i do not love him i never said he was my dearest love and yes he will save me that i know i was giving you a chance no matter where you take me theres no greater hunter than prince humperdinck he could track a falcon on a cloudy day he can find you if youll release me whatever you ask for ransom youll get it i promise you to think all that time it was your cup that was poisoned who are you well no we sort of skipped that part but it did i was there this old man said man and wife what i got married i didnt want to it all happened so fast oh westley will you ever forgive me at a time like this thats all you can think to say gently oh westley darling westley why wont you hold me we did it westley what about the rouss well never succeed we may as well die here what go on but how is that possible since hes been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago you 58 well never survive i will never doubt again well you were dead move youre alive if you want i can fly but how can you be sure but what if something happens to you i fear ill never see you again farm boy fill these with water please farm boy polish my horses saddle i want to see my face shining in it by morningmaybe he wont you are sick thats why hes here your grandfathers here guess what you feeling any betteri dont care if you do or i want to see mary before she gets in any deeper not even a hunch just hope sam if shes here sam they dont want to prosecute they just want the money back it was all in cash i dont know i dont know i still feel did he say anything about my sister yes what difference does that please he said he was dissatisfied and was going back go out there find somebody ask some questions im sorry if i seem overanxious to you i keep thinking somethings wrong i have to know what he didnt mention the money what he said on the phone isnt important is it he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother and he didnt thats what i want you to do something about mary had been there one night and had left forty thousand dollars she stole some money yes she left phoenix a week ago yesterday and no trace until will you help us i think somethings wrong out there i could stand something regular why not sam that old woman whoever she is i think she told arbogast something and i want her to tell us the same thing yes but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money thats proof mary was here it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to it didnt get washed down its figuring the kind you tear up and get rid of some figure has been added to or subtracted from forty thousand the bathroom look at how clean it is the one in our cabin is clean but this is clean hospital clean arbogast sam he liked me or felt sorry for me and he was starting to feel the same about you i heard it when he called in his voice a caring he wouldnt have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us unless he was stopped and he was stopped so he must have found out something there must be some proof that exists right now something that proves he got that money away from mary some way sam if you owned a useless business like this motel one you probably couldnt even sell what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else forty thousand dollars we have to go into that cabin and search it sam no matter what were afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt we should have asked for cabin one the one mary was in someone was at that window i saw the curtain move i believe it were going to register as man and wife and get shown to a cabin and then search every inch of that place inside and outside you going to wait here for me huh i suppose when you were able to marry her shed have presented you all shiny and proper she always tried to be proper do you know how i found out about you i found one of your letters it was a nice letter sam i wonder so many things about her now why she never told me about you funny when you think theres an answer to everything you think you know all the answers i didnt i got a job too i wonder if that hurt her my not letting her sacrifice for me some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you dont let them alive i wonder if well ever see mary again i wont feel satisfied unless i got out there sam youre not all right then call at least call yes no thank you its my problem too does that mean we cant well whos he sam he called me when he had nothing definite nothing but a dissatisfied feeling dont you think hed have called if he had anything without calling me where could he have gone sam just wait here why cant i go out there with you sam im going sam why call when we can go an hour or less patience doesnt run in our family sam im going out there yes wheres the old highway whenever i start contemplating the panic button your back straightens up and your eyes get that godlooks outforeverybody look and i feel better you have an awfully nice habit sam are we just going to go on sitting here sam he said an hour or less where can i stay you want me to stay here i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation for all i know she may be trying to get in touch with me at home id better go home no i just think anything can be explained but mary doing a thing like this i dont know how to handle i need to i need to believe something this is the first time ive ever come up against anything i couldnt understand she havent even called you why not sam is she hiding here are you two planning to go away with the money i ought to call the police right now no the man whose money she he talked so loud and fast and i i shouldve called the police i just listened and believed everything they told me she stole the money we dont want to get her in trouble no dont bring the police in yes i just did the moment they told me not that kind you men and your egos yes i hate tears huh look if you two are in this thing together i dont care its none of my business but i want to see mary i want her to tell me shes all right and its none of my business then ill go back to phoenix and what do you know about it mr loomis youre so busy being defensive that you havent even reacted to the most serious fact of all mary is missing a good reason i suppose last friday she left work and home i was in tucson over the weekend i havent heard from her not even a phone call to begin with where mary is do you dont you know i dont know where in your store somewhere in your town anywhere with you i want to know if my sister is here is mary here im marys sister may i talk to youid like to be ready when he gets back but what is there anything so terribly wrong about making a decision and wanting to hurry do you think ive stolen my car id really rather not please cant we just settle this and i think i have the necessary papers is there a ladies room all right five hundred of course not please it looks fine how much will it be with my car how much no thank you im in a hurry i just want to make a change and start yes its nothing wrong with it im just can i trade in my car and take another what i dont need pills just sleep were there

of it ill lick the stamps sam lets go get married i havent even been married once yet i pay too they also pay who meet in hotel rooms you make respectability sound disrespectful sam no we can see each other we can even have dinner but respectably in my house with my mothers picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three no i have to go sam you couldnt be a criminal if you committed a major crime can you it is tragic or it will be if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a taxdeductible excuse for flying down deductible here i havent time to argue im a working girl this meeting you in secret so we can be secretive you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and i wish you wouldnt even come sam this is the last time ive lost my girlish laughter sam when youre married you can do a lot of things deliberately checking out time is three pm hotels of this sort arent interested in you when you come in but when your times up sam i hate having to be with you in a place like this what do i do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport good night crane very early dawn id like to but i stepped into a private trap back there and i want to go back and try to pull myself out before its too late for me too im very tired and ill have a long drive tomorrow all the way back to phoenix norman yes and just one time can be enough thank you i am sorry i only felt it seemed she was harming you i meant im sorry i didnt mean it to sound uncaring wouldnt it be better if you put her in someplace no not like me why dont you go away except you she sounded strong if anyone ever spoke to me the way i heard the way she spoke to you i dont think i could ever laugh again you should mind it sometimes we deliberately step into those traps why do you ask that im looking for a private island only my share you go out with friends is your time so empty a man should have a hobby i imagine so its a strange hobby curious i mean youd know of course youre very kind dont worry about it but as long as youve made us supper we may as well eat it huh you shouldnt have bothered i really dont have that much of an appetite ive caused you some trouble id like to no thank you again i have thank you mr bates the bathroom am i that close to fairvale i want sleep more than anything except maybe food los angeles i thought id gotten off the main you have a vacancy why now what im sorry is there what ive told you theres nothing wrong except that im in a hurry and youre taking up my time please id like to go of course not am i acting as if somethings wrong then im free to go i didnt intend to sleep all night i just pulled over have i broken any laws yes as i said i couldnt keep my eyes yes i didnt mean to sleep so long i was afraid id have an accident last night from sleepiness so i decided to pull overhes already been maybe you saw mary norman took a wife bates motel he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it go on sam mary is lilas sister lets go out back and have some coca while the men are talking you didnt its tinkerbell al wants to be sure hell hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night well come on in at least oh have you two had breakfast norman found them dead together in bed i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in periwinkle blue barefaced arbogast recluse kinder word why dont you call norman and let him say just what happened if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off itll make the girl feel better albertgo on go tell her shell not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food or my son or do i have to tell her cause you dont have the guts huh boy you have the guts boy mother shes just a stranger as if men dont desire strangers as if oh i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me you understand boy and then what after supper music whispers i wont have you bringing strange young girls in for supper by candlelight i suppose in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap erotic mindsit sounds all right except for the fact that shes crazy it seems to me she has the right idea how what can i do you cant doublecross me like that you were to help me you were to operate on him you were going to put him under my power im going to call the police dr meirschultz pleasei know i am why i even heard a shot up there last night it may be but to my notion those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later suretheyre sorta queer id say theys lots of queer goings on up there they even brought a dog back to life oncei think so if youre going to be indiscreet i wish youd be a little more discreet about it rich men like winton love you and leave you you wouldnt get mixed up with that little rotter would you whats the rush theres no first act theyll all be there and we dont have to appear at any particular time why didnt you eat last night theres no hurry its early but what

night reading little dirty comic books mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it he took the lords name in vain then claimed he hadnt said it he lied daddy mother buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit and he says i would too if i was grownup is it true mother would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says i dont like that either its worse than waski i want to be called frani said she isnt here now you go home be a nice boy and go home she isnt here and im sorry but mr hillyer doesnt want her to have callers during working hours she must have gone out for a walk with the children yes this isnt punishment i dont believe in punishment its for your health obviously youre sick if you can act like that i dont think you are sufficiently in awe of it get the castor oil but we must respect that power we must be in awe of it sex isnt ugly sex is one of the most beautiful things in life the creative power of the universe is behind it now i have a plan about rose an educational plan shes getting better and we dont want any more trouble brother you ought to hear this i do wish youd speak to brother its true hes been looking at those horrible little books again oh yes its thursday hello rose dear my youre looking pretty whatd you say brother children children be quiet all of you the vibrations in this house are strange today wheres rose anyhow no you didnt say that brother what did you say brother stop gagging like that and putting on a show and swallow it this is for your own good when you look at negative destructive things like those little filthy comic books you are sick here take this oh brother i am so disappointed in you you mustnt look at those horrible things they degrade the human image brother when i have to wake you up at eleven oclock in the morning youre either sick or you were up very late last night and you werent reading huckleberry finn i looked and its not in your room now what were you doing walked in all that heat its a wonder she hasnt got sunstroke ill phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski all right all right doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap you go get them and bring them down to the living room where is the girl your impression is very reassuring brother of course shes had troubles poor thing but i sensed that was that the girl was like and im glad to have it reconfirmed wonderful whats she like brother what is your impression of her yes i think so he adores her its almost pitiful the way he worships her i just hope she isnt too much for him well yes shes happy of course dave doesnt have her life force not at all there isnt much furniture in his house just a table and one or two chairs whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows who i dont understand it even in the wild days she was never as late as this how is she better off how could she ever find love and happiness if you did what youre talking about are you insane rose isnt oversexed thats ridiculous if youre going to talk nonsense i dont want to talk to you at all rose is exactly the same as the rest of us except more so i cant believe you really meant it if i did id want to die you arent a male monster that man is but you arent look me in the eye and tell me do you really want to take roses womanhood away from her when its all she has got i thought i knew you i thought i knew you better i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man well i cant believe what ive just heard in this room a defenseless girl depending on you for protection and you propose to mutilate and destroy her how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man over my dead body this conversation is making me a little sick id say about three months are you satisfied honey what did you forget but she must know unless unless rose was there more than one person thats why im asking her who the father is its the most vital question of all whos the father dear poor thing dont cry rose i know you feel awful but dont cry honey nobodys perfect whos the father dear it sounds like a farm to me calling it a dairy establishment thats just trickery and flummery i dont know how you can call it ideal dont you know what the word farm means to her honey rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life now i dont think shes just nervous and worried and you would be too if you had no job and no place to go she does look a little peaky she cant get a job its a depression and we cant just throw her out on the street she hasnt actually done anything shes like a different person being so sick made a big impression on her i really think shes learned a lesson sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit your real trouble is that youre antiintellectual the irony is women are supposed to be emotional but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do honey dr martinson isnt a rascal hes one of the finest physicians in glenville he studied at johns hopkins university i dont see how you can even think of it now you dont like him because hes a yankee hes a brilliant doctor honey please ill talk to her ill reason with her what she doesnt understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people shes young shes got to learn to restrain the life force thats in her its creative but in her case its too creative if you mean sex you couldnt be more wrong rose likes those boys and men she has love in her heart and that is what they want its the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly she has a loving nature you ought to want someone like that around your children why do you think those boys and men like her but what i said is the simple truth and now i see something else i see more deeply into it but morals come from the heart not from rigid rules and empty laws and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would therefore shes not immoral not really who is to say our morals are better than hers but maybe youre right she could influence dolly well she does seem to cause a lot of trouble i admit but she doesnt mean any harm and itll break the childrens hearts they all love her well thats very reasonable howe i hate to bring it up but shes got an awful toothache weve got to carry her to the dentist it isnt her fault if shes popular what just a moment you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends not while there is breath in my body and when i try to talk to you seriously when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts what do you do you mock me yes yes i say that to you they were boys boy friends of rose chats what they were and why shouldnt she have boy friends do you want her to be unnatural dont you think shes human the same way you are yourself its the south thats what it is the south with its horrible traditions of slavery and crime and the oppression of women who are just as good as men and just as human scoundrels they werent scoundrels they were just boys you certainly are she has an awful toothache look at her jaw its all swollen i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl well it isnt roses fault boys and men like her you cant blame her for that hon that sulky boy was here again this afternoon i was almost scared he wouldnt go away well time will tell wont it well i wish youd stop criticizing and picking on her why shouldnt she go out and have boyfriends is she all right what time is it be kind to her she loves you so much in a perfectly proper way of course but thats a wonderful quality not a bad quality have a little patience with her shes such a goodhearted little thing and tries so hard he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children i dont think you understand her it isnt sex she wants its love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it well i admit that outfit isnt very modest but she doesnt mean any harm she just wants to attract attention i wish you wouldnt pick on rose and tease her like that of course her clothes are silly but shes ignorant naive she doesnt know any better rose you and brother wait in the car i want to speak for a moment lo mr hillyer youre not having lunch well it is a little tight but it isnt as bad as all that no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place im serious we forget hes just a child i wish youd speak to him why they wont either she looks pretty and i wish you wouldnt pick on the poor girl all the time dont listen to him rose you look pretty even beautiful whats the matter hon is anything wrong i think about what im doing all the time and ive got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody besides i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes the poor girl isnt feeling well be nice to rose shes never had a real home im not in the fourth dimension you are in the fourth dimension when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control as blake said if god had doubt the sun would go out hotcha character if i had to live with your cynicism i wouldnt want to live at all what you cant understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive not negative hope for the best i dont understand all this skepticism i thought you liked rose there are no flies on rose i dont know what youre talking about and shes such a goodhearted thing there isnt an ounce of harm or malice in her honey shes perfect she works all the time and shes wonderful with the children and they love her even brother likes her though he wont admit it i think shes just perfect oh did you say something what slow hon but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here yes its so nice i thought id work outside it isnt the fourth dimension to you its the fourth dimension maybe to me its simply the truth whats the matter with him you mustnt be a tattletale dear you mustnt be delilahish and jezebelish toward your brother dear yes dear what is it daddy wouldnt hear that now the redhaired boy you see sitting there of course you have met him he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child all children have great creative powers but i dont want to rattle on about my children they say i brag too much about them especially about brother am i boring you rose let him be guided not by my wishes and not by roses wishes although i am sure they are identical let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself because that is what has spoken through me tonight i understand you perfectly you leave that girl alone you wretched man or you will be sorry i will not cry like a woman if im upset its because of what my husband said not because of you you cant make me cry like a woman a woman has got just as much intelligence and selfcontrol as a man and you get this in your head if you hurt that girl ill hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got ill do my level best to ruin you do you understand me youd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself youd go that far dont you think i know what youve just said and dont you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime youve just conspired to commit are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters is there no limit to which you wont go to keep your illusions about yourselves what are you talking about i dont understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces yes go on what do you mean what kind of gobbledygook talk is that no you shouldnt have it was needlessly cruel she thinks she has cancer and is going to die well thats pathetic poor rose what a life she has had gonorrhea yes well shes upstairs oh good evening doctor rose is a lot better i just gave her her supper shes almost all well now yes thank you doctor it is kind of amazing the dentist says she has perfect teeth there isnt a cavity in her mouth well her people were very poor she says she was often hungry as a child and im sure the food she ate was pretty awful not a balanced diet at all deathly afraid of it her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesnt know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals she hid it from us doctor shes afraid of the hospital she looks terrible just awful that would scare her to death shes terrified of hospitals to her a hospital is where you go to die but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled she was raised on a poor dirt farm im sure shes never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor no waski she wont die because we are praying for her there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair beauty is beauty and thats all there is to it beauty is there and we have to recognize it now rose the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby she looks like an angel and she is an angel but she can be a naughty angel sometimes although her father wont believe it her real name is frances but we call her dolly or doll when he was baby we called him wa wa a baby name you know you will find him a very good boy his brother can be bad and so can his sister but waski is a very good boy and as you can see hes beautiful rose this is waski his real name is warren but we call him waski he doesnt like it much and i suppose someday well have to stop calling him that well well thats wonderful rose forget about it i dont want you working in one of those honky tonks dont worry honey youll find something rose you dont have to rose really you shouldnt act like that i know its embarrassing but who were you exposed to dear rose well now mrs hillyer i ahh thats kinda hard to say rose you dont look well and you havent eaten a bit of breakfast well theres no reason you shouldnt go out rose in moderation you look very pretty in it rose really you do you see rose now thats the kind of dress you ought to wear rose youre very sick youre burning up rose can you hear me rose rose has learned her lesson havent you rose itll get better now i know it was bad honey im sorry rose sit down in that chair and be quiet were trying to help you you silly creature sit in that chair no rose hell help you poor thing does the ice help rose be quiet rose i dont think we ought to discuss this in front of the children i had better call daddy rose that scruffylooking man is out in the yard again doll you and waski run on too well i think its charming rose but dont you think ah the skirt is a little tight you look sick if you ask me i hate to leave you with the dishes and all but im supposed to go to a meeting of the garden club this evening ill need the car keys rose youre in an awful dither tonight whats the matter with you honey are you sick or something well you run on now really why dont you go sit down somewhere rose you work too hard why dont you go sit down somewhere and drink a cocola well i am working on my thesis more history rose well its rather interesting about brother actually i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old he looked at me and understood me he knew exactly who i was i know it sounds crazy but its true hes very remarkable he was born for the ministry and could move millions but he doesnt know that yet i have to warn you about him he can be very dangerous there is an evil streak in him a streak of pure sheer meanness but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesnt know itbuddy sex dont mean a thing to me it aint nothin but a mosquito bite ill tell you a secret girls dont want sex buddy girls want love a saint just like your own mother shes up in heaven right now her and lunette there aint no doubt about it boy did i get sick of rabbit but later on after momma died and daddy wasnt doin nothin but drinkin i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew you know i oughtnt to of told

thing of all would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him yeah he tried to hide it but i saw em and a little bit he says to me you know you are beautiful now wasnt that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient wasnt it what could cheer a girl up more you dont know the bedside manner that man has got why it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin in his bag

the one at the end of the aisle didnt just fix that i think so when i was walking down the aisle i was walking toward somebody who didnt have any idea who i really was and it was only half the other

grandma you know theres no what was that i cant order my eggs without sarcasm ill have the same fine the newspapers upside down thats better than fine even with everything thats happened ive still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress maybe you should ask her some time ever thought of that you dont know now thats romantic a proposal like that and you didnt find eternal bliss what went wrong so is that what you said to her what do you mean it was incredibly romantic it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life cal ripken even applauded hes an entomologist i thought it was very unique still sweet what an incredible chauvinistic observation no im not afraid just maybe someday maybe someday i think so its a birthday present for my cousin put your finger in sixfifty sevenfifty because i think youre writing on spec and with a first person interview you might actually sell that thing oh but making up the facts as you go along is ethical actually i meant you you probably got severance or expenses or both ill take your check no credit cards my point is that one again youre getting it all wrong that wont improve your reputation any and its not very flattering to me either so im going to give you a chance to write the truth youre welcome your notes made interesting bedtime reading if you like trashy fiction your observations are distorted ungrounded an incomplete you must be very proud how do i do it im not that beautiful you misinterpret everything weve all been friends our whole lives but thats the types of relationship you wouldnt understand

your forgiveness but im weird but you havent lost your mystery youre very mysterious because you think im all like hey man check me out im going to kill myself on anything male that moves as opposed

having a daughter with problems but guess what i dont like having a father whos drunk all the time ill eat in my room no its my life just stop it dont say another word like that thank you dad his name

you know not seven like they said excuse me sir i have an actual fact for you maybe she hasnt read the paper you know its just possible that she hasnt read this yet no no youre her best friend you tell maggie and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isnt honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race before the rice hits the ground holy molyoh come on youre practically family you should thank lou and i for the wedding car a 63 buick your two cinnamon rolls the luau for maggie betty trout five dollarsyes rubbing your ears is very soothing cory does that to me when i hyperventilate his hair any color never say die make the shot dont be nervous maggie let us visualize remember what bob said be the ball bob is making her visualize the ceremony oh sure that was a long time ago see shes not a manhater at all shes very supportive of men this game is pretty important to him he made allstars in high school you know have you listened to his morning show wake up with ballplayer no shes talking about your hair yep maggie someone to see you and you are peggy phleming not the ice skater no about her getting that asshole from new york fired its been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie are you a reporter quick very quick wedding wedding you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row okay want to go to butchs for a drink or something you okay im closing lets go not eight no no i saw eight geese flying in a v see this is a mature relationship shes really found it its for the bell what happened at the luau hes

heart duckbill platypus im not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that youre irreversibly screwed up but maggie youve been like this since we were kids and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts peoples feelings maybe its time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own like bob if hes the one no youre quirky quirky and weird are two different things no im weird weird and mysterious are two different things no i dont think youre like im charming and mysterious in a way that even i dont understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you very hard to compete with especially to us married women who have lost our mystery why i know i think sometimes you just sort of spazout with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves yes good morning to you too you look good he looks better with that stuff out of his hair hes an attractive man where not that he doesnt deserve to get fired look corys going for second sneaky its probably because you got him fired for what reason some personal satisfaction hold on nobody interviews maggie in here unless theyre getting haircut yup stop it when you talk like that i get turned on and it frightens me youre a goddess so mag youve seen this huh yeah no no you tell her what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar i cant ready anymoreyou turn it on you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time you take the microwave how about youre too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long term way you dont love me is that it is there somebody else i hope i dont have to pay for that piece of information but its on the water boats all anyone talks about is the wind is it up is it down i cant live with a man who only talks about the wind boats you go out in them you come back in them i hate them i hate boats tell me hes living in squalor tell me everything he has is being repossessed including his filthy dented mobile home look oh you okay oh walter i

insanity but i had to tell you about it because walter theres something i have to tell you its so beautiful its just what i would have picked out if id had every ring in the world to choose from you

the most competitive woman in the world because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didnt whos married to i hate it im so happy becky finally i feel happy this is right this is real everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts please dont tell anyone about what happened sleepless in seattle is history were going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night no im not it doesnt mean anything it was written before i went out there before the ho im going to run back to walters arms if hes still have me made for each other dear annie thanks for your letter it was great were very excited about meeting you in new york on valentines day and seeing if we are mfeo sleepless in seattle becky well its the same woman and he was crazy about her what is this this is from seattle i saw her she looked just like this its a sign ive watched this movie too many times im so stupid from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio ive been a complete jerk he said hello that was nothing compared to this humiliation nothing you know that dream where youre walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you good night thank you i love you is this crazy becky thats not what i mean im going back over there tomorrow and talk to him i am i couldnt do it how did i get here definitely i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows what hello i always wondered about that too i know listen to this i love this part and then you left him he lost weight there and you left him no thats impossible a guy cant you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet good perfect ill be in new york with walter i can squeeze it in i want to meet you i dont know i mean what if i never meet him what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him i should say something in this about magic im going to marry walter i just have to get this out of my system i know that you think i dont know that i know thats a dumb way to begin but its the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio on the other hand maybe im just losing my mind i am not the sort of person who listens to callin radio shows dear sleepless and son they knew it time distance nothing could separate them because they knew it was right it was real it was not actually he sounded nice thats what she called him on the show because he cant sleep nothings with me what was what theres practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true about what no not remotely i just want to find out about him ill tell you the truth i heard this guy on a callin radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because ive become obsessed with him no no no its more like who is he does he have a sense of humor is he nice no forget nice ive got nice no i know that part she has a pattern of getting involved with losers once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus i need to know about him because hes involved with my sister thats what im going to do im going to go home i quit laurie i quit im going back to baltimore how does a blonde do a high five i want my money i know i know howard hi jonah sam and who is this yes come on jonah how am i going to explain this to walter this is a grotesque violation of this mans personal life but never mind perfect sandbag the father thank you tom i feel so much better just having blown this off i know i know i do not want to move to seattle but what i really dont want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something what do you think its just cold feet isnt it everyone panics before they get married didnt you i dont even know him but im having all these fantasies about a man ive never met who lives in seattle but when you met her did you believe she was the only person for you that in some mystical cosmic way it was fated i mean why did you get married was it all fireworks and trumpets and i think im going crazy tom i really do are you happily married its a sign like clockwork mom we already mom magic what what it wasnt a sign it was a coincidence oh please destinys just something weve invented because we cant stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental it is isnt it you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life its silly really i mean id seen him at the office obviously id seen him hes the associate publisher and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat which of course he was allergic to and i got his lettuce and tomato on white youll love them were going down to dc tonight to be with them christmas morning i know hes wonderful isnt he grannys dress oh mom its probably just the flowers walter and i are engaged its me shhhh hi hello magic sure you doyou dont believe in signs so youll get married in a new dress well fine fine fiddle da dee and hows it working of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department so dont be worried if it takes a while i knew we would be together forever and that everything would be wonderful just the way you feel about walter walter its quite a formal name isnt it one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time in the sack i believe you call it magic it was magic you know i was in atlantic city with my family cliff was a waiter he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier ive probably told you this a million times but i dont care and then he held my hand i was scared all sorts of thing were going through my head but after a while i forgot about them at one point i looked down at our hands and i couldnt tell which fingers were mine and which were his and i knew then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna destiny takes a hand how amazing how did it happen are his folks nice i notice these things are back in fashion oh honey hes a lovely man annie the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them well move them everybody annie has an announcement i love the symphony what are your plans in new york youre going to miss the train what about the letter so he cant write big deal i mean verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble mfeo so i mailed your letter this is a photo of hair you dont know who she was annie its a sign but he saw you right i love that dream you were standing in the middle of the street i love you too no thats the weirdest part about it what okay good goodbye you told a lie and got on a plane did you talk to him youd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it the kid is on youve got me listening to this garbage go on turn it on turn on your radio do you think at the end of the movie when shes in the wheelchair they can still do it men never get this movie plus he fell in love with a temp yes can too he lost all the weight there you want to hear about destiny if my husband hadnt gone on a diet which caused me to leave him i would never have been on that flight to miami and met rick and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says vacantoccupied vacant occupied vacantoccupied on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentines day your destiny can be your doom look at me and rick what right you are youre losing your mind what about walter and this woman is a writer thats what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers it sounds like the name of a mattress store movie thats your problem you dont want to be in love you want to be in love in a movie read it to me youre a basket case oh oh really now were getting down to it and now 2000 women want his number the guy could be a crackhead a psychopath a flasher a junkie a transvestite a chainsaw murderer or someone really sick like rick sleepless in seattle whats with you what was that about up there its not true but it feels true whatever it is you should write something about thiswhy not what was it that made you know what are you going to do sam do you think theres somebody out there you could love as much as your wife maybe even more weve been talking to well lets just call him sleepless in seattle and well be right back after this break with listener response your response to the things weve been discussing the number to call is and i dont want to invade your privacy why not have you had any relationship since good how long ago did your wife die i think its hard for him to talk to you about all this maybe we could talk and it would make

network america i have no doubt that youre a good dad you can tell a lot from a persons voice but something must be missing if jonah feels that youre still under a cloud fair enough im sure he wont be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him well i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly is he home right now you want me to talk to him why not and youre worried about

and fight like a real man you pussy listen you sick bastard what the fuck do you want whos phone i dont know screw them look whats important is that we stick together no matter what if anyone is next its you or me jen still that was a much better movie i saw it at the premiere last week god what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for weve got ta get down to business and i die naked ugh this is complete bullshit who wrote this piece of crap wait a second whoa calm down number one there were five different versions of the script given out ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script and what i die in stab 3 dewey what the hell is she rambling about now whats wrong jen see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting are you saying she was well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv why dont you start talking i dont think so just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood just because you knew her and now i mean murders on your set and still you say nothing answer the question you knew sidneys mom theyre the ones who approved it oh come on why the hostility excuse me detective i think we have some business to attend to i think we should go inside i have to have a talk with the cast all of you heh well thats tv journalism for ya stage the news to boost ratings tom prinze tanked as usual thats a shocker lets get out of here i know he killed kincaid we did some researching in the archives sid something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mothers murder for two years of her life 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth whos this whatd he say oh my god sidney you ran fast or what heyrob reiner and quentin tarentino i think miltons the killer i think he just went out to kill another cast member oh come on you have made millions off the story of her murder youre obsessed with her and youre obsessed with her daughter good twist bitch look whos talking moneybags you got more homes than i do basements creep me out gale weathers would find a way there a story in that building need to get in that building thats funny you know in the movies i play you as being much smarter heres how i see it ive got no house no movie no gun and im

he was drunk that night he left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him not one word he admits to having sex with your mother but thats all many times i think you falsely identified him yes he was convicted in a court of law your testimony put him away it doesnt matter what i think what is your problem you got what you wanted cotton weary is in jail theyre gon na gas him a book is

disillusioned wheres god etc completely suicidal and one day she snaps she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression please its common knowledge her mother was a trollop maybe shes a slut just like her mom maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage what if she did it what if sidney killed casey and steve for attention the girl has some serious issues she was never attacked i think she made it all upwhere do you get this shit cut some slack she watched her mom get butchered youre evil

he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge god i was in love with grant he was so hot the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman with stu theres little time to stop and reflect but sometimes before to relax and get in the mood i think about grant goodeve billy and his penis dont deserve you you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mothers untimely death its no big deal youll thaw out he better not be i told stu to keep his mouth shut i think we can live

her there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve thats why many of us became nuns its marvelous reverend mother oh shes doing just fine reverend mother yes reverend mother on behalf of the sisters id like to welcome mary clarence to st katherines impossible christy excuse me has anyone seen a nun but how do we get there its so beautiful shes our inspiration she wasnt a nun you mean they kidnapped her well pray and shell be there mary clarence sister maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us mary clarence you shouldnt have where did you get this but reverend mother everyone loves our new style its better than ice cream hes kind hes not like other guys we did it we actually sang a chord really mary clarence were you a choirmistress which convent was that sisterhe said sing the devil away but the lord came to me i was hellbound yes thats what they say satan was waiting i was downhearted mary clarence but what do they want where are we going again wait this isnt the way who are you the council of cardinals im so nervous what if i forget the words are you leaving us a thankyou for what youre the one we should be thanking were nuns honor thy mother and thy father too dont kill dont steal its bad for you i dont want to mess anyone up what now stop that you didnt shoot at me you were only trying to help to give me experience i tried to explain that to reverend mother but i dont know if she understood we could have been killed but you saved me thank you mary clarence what was all that who was that man why would he shoot at us oh my lord mary clarence mary clarence i cant wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences ive learned so much mary clarence youre so different from the other sisters sometimes well sometimes you sound more like a layperson those people are wonderful why dont we ever see them in church im getting experience who are all these people really i have to do this so i can become a nun experience right we need experience mary clarence are you sure of course we must do it its the will of god what is it what she says i should wait she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life she says that im not experienced enough to make the decision yet in a mature manner oh mary clarence im so unworthy i want to take my final vows i would do it tomorrow but reverend mother wont let me no you dont understand i dont want to get out i want to get in you have to help me a novice three years sister mary robert im mary robert an extra heel of bread please take it you need your strength youve been working so hard i i brought you something i i its after five we have to bathe come on were late not a note mary clarence youre alive a benedictine the little sisters of the moonlight and what a lovely name las vegas well i dont care who she is we cant sing without her an entertainer yes two men and they had guns we cant sing without her what should we do its no use she just isnt here mary clarence dont be silly youre an example to us all youve taught us so much were singing for the cardinals and then who knows maybe the choir can travel to schools and nursing homes ice cream its brought people back to the church its better than springtime id rather sing than do anything hes decent that was exciting mary clarence has a background in music thats what reverend mother said is this like your old convent since mary clarence came to st katherines ive been shot at kidnapped by mafia hit men and ive tasted beer is that enough experience yet for final vows reverend mother las vegas shes here somewhere she said they were from her old convent i dont understand where is shereally perhaps well thank you oh dont push it perhaps not perhaps we can all use a little spandex you have evidenced great maturity mary robert we shall have a serious discussion very well i hold you responsible for all of this for introducing a lounge act into my convent for utterly disrupting our way of life and for placing all of us in mortal danger thankyou im a christian oh saving you move good day i am sorry mary clarence i seem to have misplaced my tambourine good day mary clarence you and i know that life is not so simple there will be disappointments rude shocks and you will have vanished how fortunate a part of what mary clarence it is one thing to rabble rouse to sweep into town and declare a holiday you have raised the sisters expectations you have excited and confused them they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party indeed after how long a few weeks i have been here thirty years and yet it would seem i know nothing i must go where i can be of use i have submitted my resignation to bishop ohara privately i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible really well that makes two of us you have a phone call the majority has spoken of course mary clarence a convent is not a totalitarian state most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole a membership that i am certain will vote in a rational and pious manner all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program i believe this can be settled by a simple vote the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church they command the utmost respect your more secular entertainment would be wholly out of place and on such an occasion i feel a completely traditional program will be best and i am refusing as of tomorrow mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir out of the question through blasphemy you have corrupted the entire choir and what next popcorn curtain calls this is not a theater or a casino the choir mary clarence go for the gold youre my olympic event you will sing and you will sleep that is your schedule until you depart as almost no one attends mass you will be unable to cause further damage you have i believe some minimal background in music therefore you are to join our choir you may stay but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task mary clarence perhaps you are correct clearly you have learned nothing and you present an ongoing threat both to this convent and to yourself mary clarence i have given you every opportunity to change to make a decent life for yourself mary roberts life was in danger your behavior was inexcusable i dont believe we have anything to say to each other months of work and the loom absolutely ruined good mary patrick i need you in the office mary clarence carry on how to put it ah of course mary clarence no pain no gain do your recall the words of saint peter in ecciesiastes 127 he spoke unto a wastrel youth he said take up thy task and know ye the path of contentment you are correct sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation such as your own for example how do you feel about physical labor we are nuns we seek solutions through prayer this is a convent not a clinic we offer moral guidance not hardware a balloon and a banana tell me mary clarence what were you thinking mary clarence come sister girls this is sister mary clarence shell be minding you until sister mary patricks return mary clarence please assign a biblical passage do not attempt discussion am i understood from all ive heard just about everything your singing career seems all but nonexistent and your married lover wants you dead im sure if i were you i would use this time to think about my life and its direction or lack thereof it is nine pm pleasant dreams your cell is more than adequate and whom would you call useless distractions our lives are simple we have little need for material possessions your cell your room this shall be your cell mary clarence yes until breakfast no food not until sundown a fast to remind us of the poor of those who must endure without enough to eat as a new member of our order i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast until sundown surely you are familiar with this practice mary clarence only when our lips are silent can our prayers truly be heard sisters for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence and the vow of chastity the vow of obedience the mary is in deference to the holy mother the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola there are three vows that every nun must accept the vow of poverty as of now and until you leave you are sister mary clarence normally dressed you are a sore thumb and you endanger us all while you are here you will conduct yourself as a nun only i shall know who and what you truly are you will not disrupt the convent you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk you will draw no attention to yourself in any way excused open the cabinet to your left you will find appropriate attire would you like that before we do you might like to freshen up and youll certainly want to change of course but its almost lunch check your drivers license absolutely not i mean the wicked the heedless and their las vegas concubines and all those like you i joined this convent some thirty years ago at that time the world knew some measure of peace and hope our order was a beacon of hospitality to families to children to a neighborhood filled with promise and as the years have passed i have watched that promise destroyed drugs gangs spandex and so i have made this convent an oasis a retreat from horror and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls it has come to pass your cigarette out miss van cartier sit down i see the reason you were unhappy st annes very well enough joking your name what is your full name your christian name however we can also pray for other things all right its a beginning las vegas nevada she shouldnt have come back she knew she was in danger really mary clarence how is your weaving progressing i need to see you at once girls please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments mary clarence sister mary patrick yes mary patrick yes but where but she was a showgirl she didnt have an old convent calm down think clearly mary robert do you have any idea who those men were her whereabouts are unknown and we must proceed without her pull yourselves together but bishop surely you realize this is a most dangerous neighborhood i lied but bishop were a small convent bishop surely there are more appropriate shelters but shes been exposed to the underside of life she is the underside of life absolutely not i am very sorry but noi i cant do this quickly close it ichabod what was that the church where are we going speak the words constable what is stopping you what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality call me a liar then and a murderess say it out and out if you think i am behind this say it yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them i have not been able to face him yet he did not do these things if you knew him you would realize when when you spoke fathers name along with accusations i could not believe it i had to hide these at least till i could confront him myself i have been reading your journal im sorry i found it too fascinating to resist i rode to catch up with you at the notary out of curiosity before i found you though i overheard what you were said what is so urgent im drawing bad blood from the wound the skull is gone my god what has happened what are you doing what did you say but i am not alone am i i only wished to see what you were up to and to thank you i apologize if i worried you it is only me if you want me to go i will do you want me to leave she died her lungs were diseased two years ago what is this about no but why do you ask that what what has happened the things i said to you before i was wrong to say them what troubles you you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it cant you see youll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it but why tell me why take a lesson from young masbaths desires ichabod crane he follows with you to avenge his fathers death that i understand but what do you want what is it then scientific method how can any of this matter in the slightest and this gives worth to butchery must i hear this what are you on about i have misjudged you i think i did not imagine you were so cruel why would you do such a thing wont they still have that justice or was it a vain promise people have put their trust in you you promised justice that would be a pity those words might show you something youve never seen before i insist that you have it then i also have a gift for you true magic which even you will not be able to deny oh you are hopeless may i keep it at least dont you see why look closely a moment put your intellect aside cant you see what is inexplicable you made this and the drawings yes he does may i try it would be interesting to find out these scars how did you get them you pay great attention to small things i hide these as i hide all my books father would not approve lest it were the bible you do not disturb me please stay having trouble sleeping you are funny really then what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom or even in a teardrop to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black not all think it is the horseman many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer offering death as tribute and still others believe none of it ive read a

that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another and what are you his chaperone ahhah i see a cozy dinner but arent threesomes a little awkward how does the phrase go and how many people will be attending this birthday party and whats the occasion of this celebration an invitation no at least i dont think i am what wonderful when your next book is published maybe you could come into the store and do a signing im sure we could get a lot of people to show up okay ill read it tonight and call you tomorrow it doesnt seem to be too long i get off for lunch in ten minutes can i treat you to a hamburger id love to almost done a week or ten days and ill be there its been a while i thought maybe youd be in touch what happened jesus what happened to you which explains why this hasnt been the easiest summer of my life thats the subject of my last chapter of course i fool around but not so much when it comes to my work its true have you ever read pierre or the ambiguities visions of utopia in nineteenthcentury american fiction american literature what else its just a summer job something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation muncie indiana he and my mother met as students but im from brooklyn my sisters and i were all born and bred right here until she was twelve she moved here in fortynine i keep waiting for the next novel to come out anything in the works i thought i recognized you youre paul benjamin the writer arent you will that be cash or chargehenry told cyrus hed kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again when henry makes a threat like that people tend to take him seriously no i dont suppose it has he was broken up like nobodys business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead jesus had nothing to do with it if hed been involved he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did dont put words in my mouth what im saying is she drove off in cyruss car and went to the fivespot lounge with him for a drink what im saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car he was in no shape to drive but he drove the car anyway and before he could get her back to where she lived the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed cyrus lived but he came out of it a cripple his left arm was so mangled the doctors had to cut it off small punishment for what he did if you ask me his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born louisa was henrys younger sister and she and the baby moved in with us four or five years go by and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue tail between his legs wanting to patch things up with louisa i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door theyre both big men those two and if they ever started to tangle youd see some teeth jumping on the floor i guarantee it so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet and the poor girl never came back and nothing thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said i dont have a father as far as im concerned that sonofabitch is dead i figured he had a right to know well one thing i suppose but i dont think it has anything to do with this a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said shed spotted thomass father working at some gas station outside of peekskill no thank you hes in trouble all right but i dont have any idea what it is which brings me back to my original question what was he doing here in the first place his mothers dead and he hasnt seen his father in twelve years he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn i always knew that boy had an imagination but now hes gone and made up a whole new life for himself do you mind if i sit down hes been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby and we dont live in manhattan we live in boerum hill in the projects his parents is that what he told you his parents i just want to know where he is and what was he doing here in the first place thats what i want to know whats a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for are you some kind of pervert or what rashid rashid is that what he told you his name was thomas cole thomas jefferson cole my nephew dont give me any of that i know hes been here you cant fool me mister im looking for my nephew thomas what do you mean howd i get in i pushed the door and walked in what do you think i just want to know what your game is mister thats all is your name paul benjaminanything auggie just name it im sorry baby i cant help it i

you you remember that am i or am i making so much sense that youre going insane did i or was that you when you were hiding in the bathroom all conspiratorially like you were you became frightened didnt you terrified like you were with the snake earlier and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor you did that norman one lonely terrifying sea snake and the snakes you want to know about the snakes you saw one outside earlier didnt you when you thought i had deserted you you were terrified am i lying are you sure are you absolutely sure im lying then explain to me about the jellyfish earlier why did we see jellyfish harry doesnt fear jellyfish you do theyre your fear arent they cmon what yes someone did but it wasnt me norman it was you you manifested the snakes you think i manifested the snakes no he cant no he isnt same reason i put explosives around the habitat for defense for the power to protect myself whats the phrase keeping up with the joneses if i was then i wouldve had to have gone in the sphere wouldnt i dont you you tell me am i afraid of them not during the day sea snakes are diurnal when the suns out they dont bite fortunately for you i had on my watch this is quite good snakes what do you mean exactly i did do that didnt i you dont think i put something in it do you its getting cold are you whats wrong norman oh yes my watch i almost forgot what was that i couldnt hear you hows harry what do you mean different in the sub resetting the timer why what is it norman youre not sorry youre scared youre a psychologist norman you pride yourself on knowing when someones lying to you not telling you the truth and now youre scared because youre not sure you can tell anymore for what only lab rats here you ever given an injection before look its either him or us norman another attack and we go down with this place to be on the safe side i mean its an idea what if it takes 20 minutes norman what if it takes an hour and he can fight it off we cant afford that how fast does it take effect ill just boost the doses how long does it last used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride causes sleep its a soporific how do you spell it antibiotic antihistamine for bites and may also cause bizarre halucinations tranquilizer causes drowsiness nothing about drowsiness a synthetic opium analogue ulcers its for motion sickness something for burns why would harry go back to using a code and thats the part of harry thats being manifested his dream you cant control your dreams and you cant control your fears can you but why is he doing it which i told barnes was attacking how can the sphere do that but how you think in the sphere what do you mean a part of harry what manifested squids what damn it norman hes lying dont you get it there is something seriously fucked up going on here and hes causing it why cant you believe me you think its me you think im saying there was a conversation when there wasnt damn it norman i swear i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up you dont believe me no it wasnt i swear none of this was here none of it you think he hid it earlier he mustve hid it none of this was here before wait a second that wasnt in there before the refridgerator fixing it but i fixed whered you get all that whats harry doing with your suit in there you get it straightened out deserts you harry said hed take over for me getting food we were out of food whats wrong you sound mad what do you mean im in the ship still clear you cant counters at 10 minutes you dont have time yes norman i did youre just nervous whats the matter still clear the subs a 100 feet in front of you you see it you press a button norman its not brain surgery here go ahead you only have 15 minutes to reset it go on norman you dont trust me i fixed your suit i dont trust harry to do it you should know how it works just in case maybe you should go to the sub get the helium out of our bloodstream we go to the surface now wed pop like a soda bottle we cant the storm the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here and we have four days of decompression when we get up top you me and harry hes asleep its also our only way out of here it holds three people and theres only three of us left now dont bother me norman i have to reset the sub no i should stay calm like you say right norman stay calm yeah okay sure norman you bastard you did didnt you you told him about me you said something to him didnt you dont tell me to calm down hes not just a navy captain he works for the fucking pentagon in edmunds things although advised of risks all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft signed barnes usn fuck you norman its right here so who was barnes talking to at the last minute nobody yeah he told you think what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose he was on the phone except that cable is a thousand feet long norman they wouldve broken off communication with us four five minutes before they cleared out he lied to us he left us down here eggs norman she was crushed feel her skin its like sandpaper i didnt do anything wrong i didnt mean nobody said norman what why are you looking at me like that what wait dont why are you i mean im not i wasnt absolutely sure if they what why yeah why what they have six tentacles a new species and the squid too they had no stomach normally id say no everythings quiet now no ships no divers no electricity makes sense but whats curious is these arent normal jellyfish what about you what happened to you my gosh norman a bad one it was the only book in there norman come here look at this the library it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas norman good theory ted such a gentlemen when youre scared shitless youre next norman isnt there a psychological term for that dr johnson just keep your mouth shut alright this could mean everything to our careers you know that dont jeopardize this well lets pray thats the only mistake you made have you said anything to barnes about this well you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here in the ocean 70 percent of the earths surface is water norman thats first grade geography what do you expect for them to bring it up here to the spacecraft to investigate because when we get down there do yourself a favor norman are you listening dont tell anyone what you just told me thats quite a secret ive read it twice norman its brilliant i love secrets who says its a he norman wheres norman im a woman i dont theorize i only deal with facts i dont get it well think because theres footprints here that arent mine whats that mistake number two

dull if you know what i mean if i do you can punish me fly me to bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks this is fantastic i wish clark were here wellflashlight this is incredible i was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you i mean you dont have an answering service right the answer is yes now whats the question whawhat are you doing here superman with my luck now itll rain whowho oh god im going to die youve got me whos got youi dont know but it was weird in terms of what happened next sean was still watching his mother he never took his eyes off his mother even as he moved to sit beside nicole he looked frightened yes abbot understands these things anything you didnt understand you heard what abbott said whos been talking to you about what im feeling who should care about what im feeling what other people and billy told you that hell tell that to youve talked to billy billy said that he knows that billy because id be to blame right i told you that i was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened thats how i remembered it but the truth is i might have been doing sixty or sixty five and if thats true that i was over the limit when the bus went over what would happen then i have a question for you mr stephens the walkers loved sean he was their only childthe object of all their attention i mean wendells a withdrawn sort of man thats his nature but risa shes still got dreams what do you mean thats right what do you mean a strange little fellow but you couldnt help liking him he was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six with our hands yes the oldfashioned way abbott and i used to do a lot of that in the spring yes like i was putting them into my big basket clearing the hillside of its children thats the way i thought of them sometimes no i saw it on his face no nothing like that billys wife lydia died of cancer a few years ago he took over raising the children by himself it was obvious how much he missed lydia from what billy loved to see his kids in the bus they always sat in the back so they could wave to each other it comforted him those are all from the fair last year abbott and me were judges at the pet show oh yes like i said they always came out together to see him off to school its like he was their little treasure he was such a beautiful boy thats a picture of him on the wall there behind abbott no nothing like that the ottos are what id call model citizens theyre regular at town meetings they give their opinions in a respectful way they always help out at various fundraising bazaars in town though they arent church goers i mean the way they look their hair and clothing about the ottos dolores no one calls me mrs driscoll the ottos always waited for the bus with bear they were the only parents who did that together like that i guess theyre what you might call hippies oh its bizarre alright cmon bear lets get you out of here ill just strap it on the roof i didnt say that well its certainly what youd call interesting good morning wanda hi hartleygoodnight mr ansel oh right what do you mean outgrown it no i mean i remember mrs ansel wearing some of this stuff buti dont feel funny about that i really liked her i dont know it just seemskind of weird are you sure okay was it good hi mr ansel hi jessica mason its the truth no whats this lawyer business whos mr stephens from you is this mine i feel like a princess its interesting how was it and winter what happened to summer he thought it was cute when i called him frankenstein it wasnt i feel like his monster should i keep reading no not mean justvery angry yes becausehe wanted to them to be punished thats right what mason okay dont you usually like to sit at the back to wave at your dad yes rats they fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles and ate the cheeses out of vats and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles split open the kegs of salted sprats made nests inside mens sunday hats and even spoiled the womens chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats its like a song the pied piper of hamelin by famous hanover city the river weser deep and wide washes its wall on the southern side a pleasanter spot you never spied but when begins my ditty it was snowing why dolores you seem very sure about that the truth is that it was an accident and no ones to blame i wont lie what do you want me to do for you mr stephens yes like bear and the ansel twins and sean and you can only feel lucky that you didnt die for so long then you start to feelunlucky i dont like thinking about the accident i dont even remember it happening besides it just makes people feel sorry for me and i remember the bus swerved it just suddenly swerved to the right and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road and then it went over the embankment there and everyone was screaming and everything and thats all i guess i was unconscious after that thats all then i was in the hospital yes i do now now that im telling it no because the bus went off the road and crashed i was scared and there wasnt time no yes i told you i was positive the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was positive seventytwo miles an hour yes i looked i remember clearly now it seemed we were going too fast down the hill i was scared the speedometer and it was downhill there dolores was driving too fast yes i understand i was scared before the actual accident yes there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there right by the dump and dolores slowed down not to hit him and he ran into the woods and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road as usual i remember that im remembering it pretty clearly yes as im talking im remembering more about it yes no until the accident no yes there was my usual place on the right side the first seat yes like what i mean i dont remember a lot no i was alone my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day about eightthirty in the morning yes someplace where no one knows her someplace strange and new shell move away will the police do anything to her whats going to happen to dolores how about sunday night thats always the best time great he couldnt look at me but i looked at him right at him his secret was mine now we used to share it but not anymore now i owned it completely i mean im a wheelchair girl now its hard to pretend im a beautiful rock star not like you used to tell me remember daddy all the people that were going to discover me where are they now great no as opposed to this tv nothing how will he do that what about insurance doesnt insurance pay for these things but you didnt lose me my lawyer why do i need a lawyer you and mom have a lawyer thats too high ill never reach it the door needs a lock its okay very slick the ramp they say im lucky because i cant remember the accident mrs ansels clothing nothing just the way dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals its like the biggest thing in her life you dont sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure you mean it reallywhy did you do that billy is it true that you gave nicole one of lydias dresses that she was wearing it when the bus crashed because i have to i have to or that the guardrail wasnt strong enough mr stephens says that someone didnt put a right bolt in the bus something made this happen billy mr stephens is going to find out what it was good night billy youre leaving just like we look forward to this they can look forward to that your kids never cry yes tomorrow im going to put sean on the bus he wont want to go he never does hell cry and want to hold on to me when the games over i guess no it should be dry by now billy do you have to smoke wendell can smell if someones been smoking have you been waiting long cant you make it later billy thats too early no wanda does these photographic things thats one of her pictures on the wall crafts theyre smart been to college they moved here from the city about a dozen years ago yes wanda and hartley they lost bear he was their adopted son a beautiful boy

because thats where their bones are he killed ihundredsi he took them here and he killed them their bones are in the fireplace its not real crain hes not real and theyre all locked together in here and he wont let go of them i dont know a lullaby i guess my mother used to hum it to me and her mother before that and so on hugh crain would you care to dance it doesnt matter even if theyre tormenting me someone wants me what i do with this is up to me i can be a victim or i can be a volunteer and i want to be the volunteer why sure welcome home it was a stupid thing to do lets say it wasnt you who did it are you coming to confess im sorry im messing up the study i got more scared yes i looked at theo she had a look on her face i wasnt thinking about my mothers bathroom in the bathroom in my mothers room the toilet was next to an old wooden table it smelled like that wood it was very specific that smell oh god sorry theo i think youve asked us that three times doctor marrow whats going on all the carvings yes because someone was always keeping me awake ever since i was little that was my job i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long and she woke up all the time and after she died well its been a few months but i still i still wake up its a habit i know weve only known each other a couple of hours but im really glad to be with people who let me talk about this im really happy to be here with you im really honored to be part of this study jim you can call me nell dr marrow why yes why who is there something about the house why do you need a chain like that im with dr marrows group im supposed to check in with mrs dudley up at the house is she here are you mister dudley the caretaker oh you scared me no one will come any nearer than that why would we well ive never lived with beauty you must love working here theyre so beautiful arent they mrs dudley oh theo you know i dont have an apartment just had to be sure theyre all in here all the ones he killed theyre just children we have to help them i dont think i want any but the painting this is real im not making it up theo you saw it you were there the banging and last night you you all saw the painting carolyn showed me where she hid him hid him with all the ones he killed because i dont want to ruin things because home is where the heart is what do you think i think so im trying have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid itd ruin things i dont know you know ill take that as a compliment in the city what kind of place do you live in im sorry i was mad at you theo red what else ive never had a pedicure before i dont know what to think anymore theres hundreds of them this must be a record of the children who died at the mills like luke said why theo did you no its getting worse david david david watts can you hear us david daviiiiid whats his first name how could he have left without his keys yes i feel realy rested too theo you know it wasnt a joke theo good night theo yes ive missed it a monster but he built this for the woman he loved like the taj mahal i love this house i really love this house i know i dont have anyone but i do have a little apartment of my own it has a little flower garden you can just see the ocean at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the buoys in the harbor no ohh sure you have trouble with commitment not really im between jobs right now my last job it the person i was working for the job ended over so and you thats why were here i dont know what you mean its all i could afford fifteen dollars this its from a thrift shopnell was sure shed be in here nell will the two of you shut up god damn it maybe the tests were right marrow shes sensitive shes vulnerable but i dont think shes suicidal and i didnt have to test her maybe she wasnt trying to kill herself maybe she was really scared maybe she really heard voices maybe someday yeah that depends on your definition of ghosts im going to check on her and then im going to stay awake were fucked were in a haunted house and we cant get out until the morning mister very talky would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you no you could have he must have left didnt like the looks of the place or something luke and why didnt marrow tell us doesnt he trust women that fuck the rest of you may hate your insomnia but i find it the best time of the day for me im alone nobodys talking to me but myself my mind is racing with ideas and i can think but the experiment was a failure im not going back to new york city im going to find an apartment with a little flower garden where you can just see the ocean and at night when the wind comes in just right you can hear the sound of the harbor what about you oh god we cant get out hes wandering around the house and nell heard him she thought it was ghosts lets go look for him again she needs help yes but i promised i wouldnt let her alone the whole night how could you do this to people its okay were all here maybe theyre marys well this is a cozy breakfast when do we take the tests no but nells been here longer than i have then lets go get you one whatd you come back for babe come on why are we waiting i do im going to stay with you until you fall asleep and then im going to get some brandy nell it makes sense it all makes sense you and i we were scaring each other working each other up nell what happened then who is come on nell deep down if you really thought it wasnt jim why wouldnt you be leaving right this second why wouldnt you be afraid really afraid marrow said the same thing as last night he says that he checked with mrs dudley and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney he says that he thinks that the flue was open and with the windstorm he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current okay are you sure my place isnt like yours nell it doesnt have a view of sea it doesnt have a view of anything whats interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls living with me my boundaries arent very well defined nell do you know what i mean you want to move to new york you want to move in with me i have a loft me too although i learned one thing about you that you dont know about yourself you can be a pretty decent bitch well just think about one thing right now what color well it wasnt me mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that hes in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and you said the good doctor was with you before he painted your name over mister crain thats so sad i dont know youve been alone for a long time maybe you want attention maybe he did it maybe you did it yourself is it over maybe he never came in if hed come in he would have left his bags at the door right or maybe he got here early and went for a walk and fell maybe hes outside david watts two sets i dont know maybe theyre not even his i guess oh your hair it looks good if this was some sort of joke im going to kill him you too happy tossing and turning no the world has missed you youve been out of the world for a long time havent you the taj mahal wasnt a palace it was a tomb why didnt he tell us youre okay jeez a blank canvas i could paint your portrait directly on you or maybe not so you husbands boyfriends girlfriends where do you live my boyfriend thinks so my girlfriend doesnt if we could all live together but they hate each other its hard to be miss perversity when youre the only one at the party dyou know what i mean dont tell me boston is different from new york that depends what do you do dont worry i probably wont be in here much light sleeper wait youre not wearing that ironically this is really you thatd be seventy in new york you stole it what did it cost and what youre wearing thats great toowhy not we think just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time nothing i guess its hard to pass on this road ive lived in la all my life ive never done this drive hey i thought you werent a buffet person it mustve been a time a golden moment i like the colors not who food should we get italian italian italian oh god for some eating is a sensual experience the sensual experience you demand to be served a fork fetishist like you why what kind of food its an observation like im hungry when are we eating its not a knock no youre not specific enough to be a person youre more like a vibe well youre certainly not a person im loyal to things that make me happy is that a problem then what good is he i want to know why you need that scary guy in your house i used to hate it now i like itid rather be with him than without him i dont want to be found dead in la hard to miss no but i know what he means you just cooking then well those are the breaks really probably uhhuh not much you youre just on a higher plane wilson poor baby friends and colleagues how do you know whats in big sur i could use a vacation of course i keep forgetting for you this is a vacation i dont know few hours i guess up the coast she never would have turned you in not in a million years still you could never do what she wanted she told me you were a ghost in her life daddy the friendly ghost coming back to haunt her a leech on the welfare state in addition you dont miss a trick minor officials bother you dont they wont he be looking for you about now i guess youre just habitual whatd your father do he alive to see this what about your grandmother stick with me kid looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes yeah well youre here now where h urricanes h ardly ever h appen only in the movies they want southern i do southern they want midwest i do midwest they want tall blonde and twentytwo im shit out of luck one thing i cant do is english americans cant shouldnt even try and laurence olivier couldnt do us pushing the legal limit even then i dont believe it you have been away or is all this just new to you overnight what about just now who remembers i was inside once i punched a cop at a demo from pursuing your chosen profession it didnt discourage you though you mean if theyd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess what did you do to make them take the early 70s away from you still there have been rewards its sunny and some of the producers who call even have credits its too involved a lifetime of non involvement anywhere else id be an interesting little number here im just sag number fortyeight thousand and one sag meaning screen actors guild you dont know how ive compromised my standards these more highlights from the zagat prison guide this towns been chewing my flesh since what we now refer to as the early 70s christ my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me you think terry gave me access to her things probably sold her clothes shed never called me like that before she sounded more pissed off angry than upset or afraid but she never turned up i called the house but only got the answer machine when they found her shed been going the wrong way not the direction shed have gone if shed been coming to see me or coming straight to see me who knows maybe she just wanted to drive jenny was supposed to come to my place that night she called me asked if she could come over she and terry had been having some trouble lately i dont know about what on this occasion it reached some sort of crisis point theres the phone you want his number on what what makes you so certain terrys never going to give you satisfaction not the type you dont believe it was a car accident you fuckin guys and your dicks are you serious so whats the deal you and terry valentine at twenty paces is that what this is about when he wants someone run down youre willing to do it for him in what capacity are you employed by this mr lindgren right i thought you said you never did an honest days work in your life i bet i see what line is he in whos mr lindgren your employer lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing like me but on a grander scale of failure do you even know who terry valentine is thats what was estimated where you get your bank statements whats that like a po box the address jenny gave me that wasnt a prison was it were you still married at the time to jennys mother i mean i gave him yours said here you want to write i think this is a relative i guess i thought i was being true to jenny who told me she didnt have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why i should really give him a call hes a character isnt he well not to you i meant to us squares in the outside world and youve seen eddie rama i mightve been away for the weekend you havent been lurking outside my building all day when did you get in she was happy here however the two of you might have parted dont think she wasnt she was twentyone when she came to me straight from leaving you you werent disappointed in her then modelling when im not honing my craft in episodic television i do doubleduty as a voice coach not that her accent would have hobbled her progress not with that look she never told anyone else about the convict strain or is it stain no i was privileged i was someone who helped jenny efface her past disappointed not ashamed not embarrassed im sorry i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went it mustve been the bars now whos being sarcastic three seasons they found thats the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail i was wife number three the ingenue if it played in england somebody owes me money who told you that eddie sarcastic moi maybe ill mellow when my ship comes in its expected any day now im all packed and ready to go sounds like beverly hills try calling me again well that kind of security cant be bought must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out from the wembley staduim job wasnt it pink floyd concert receipts jenny wouldve been fourteen at the time in any case i dont suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel i heard you were whats that adorable phrase at her majestys pleasure thats not what i heard its been a while been busy have you no why did you come here why did you come here not her brand you look alikeplease mr crane its ok please its ok i wanted to make you happy but i do appreciate it mr crane youre an enthusiast im only sorry that i didnt play better for you i know it wouldve made you happy you know what you are i do appreciate the interest youve taken though im not certain ill have a career at all and if i do ill probably be a veterinarian but it doesnt matter really im not interested in playing music professionally it doesnt matter mr crane but more or less i stank didnt i geez mr crane geez mr crane i dont know i hadnt really thought about a career or stuff oh mr crane boy well sure i guess pop says so too i work pretty hard at school thats what he keeps telling me pop doesnt like people smoking in here weve certainly missed you we havent seen you since im terribly sorry hello mr crane oh in there i messed up a little bit in the scherzo i guess if nobody noticed its ok mr crane this is tony a friend of mine tony mr crane hi mr crane beethoven he created it and yet he never actually heard it i suppose he heard it all in his head somehow he was deaf when he wrote this im so sorry i was sorry to hear its ok i guess no i dont really im not big on music ordinarilynah dont say anything im alright i knew wed pay for it my books used to be perfect anyone could open them up make sense of the whole goddamn store should i should i tell you why i know all about that but i dont know how much to tell them i helped him cook the books ed i did do that i dont know what happened to big dave i know some of it irregularities in my books they said can i explain it i dont know whats going on i honey its just a goddamn bowl of cherries im sure life is so goddamn wonderful you almost wont believe it gratulations gina its so goddamn wonderful whats so damn strange about that that means i dont run nirdlingers money problems hes thinking about canceling the annex ahh dave what a knucklehead oh dont be a grump come on get ready its important me us the party at nirdlingersi told you last week for the christmas push honeyim rachel abundas everyone calls me birdy i know who you are mr crane he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas oh no that was written by mr ludwig van beethovendr frock we will no dr frock you cant that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes none of that matters now the people upstairs need us we have to help whats that dr frock did you hear that i think so whats going on and its hungry its been two days since its eaten there are five hundred people arriving right now the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell all those people in one enclosed space with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear nocturnal external hair and bony plates locomotor speed 6070 kilometers reduced optic chiasm poor eyesight external mucoid nasal glands very keen scent morphological characteristics highly robust aggressiveness extreme all right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw species unidentified genus unidentified phylum unknown male weight in excess of 240 kg brain capacity 900 centimeters that means its highly intelligent quadrupedal but a virus normally codes for other viruses this ones making human and animal proteins listen to this glycotetraglycine collagenoid weinsteins tropic hormone 4 monoxytocin supressin hormone look at this an ambyloid reovirus protein that explains why the computers confused the plants infected with a virus several problems with that theory for one thing this egg is intact for another according to pendergast the crates were shipped here on a boat everyone on board was killed like beauregard if the thing hatched in midocean where did it go lets not jump to conclusions this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr frock what are they whatever it is it must be common on the tepui john used it as packing material what is it a blow dart seed pods a plant press pretty unimpressive stuff that cuthbert what a piece of work someones dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit you are this museum it wont be the same without you im not giving up your work is highly relevant what about your display on primitive pharmacology cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you how can you say that you know its not true let me help i can take care of everything we cant do without you youre one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology youre practically an institution around here i dont believe it fourth floor west wing but stay with your class evolutionary biologist i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years im an evolutionary biologist what do you do yes i do okay how about lunch yes hes fine greg take care of yourself yes whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant when the crates were put in secure storage they were out of reach the killer couldnt get them so it got the next best thing pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victims brains this is it this is what he or it is after the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain try weinsteins tropic hormone what kind of hormones its reptilian theres another possibility a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage turkish gecko i believe a lizard its not mammalian thats for sure i think its reptilian mbwun for once im glad youre rumor central what in the world is going on thats impossible what i have the species identification on these teeth we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program call dr frock he wanted a demonstration but at what a price im so glad to see you whats the occasion i cant do it quickly please aim for the eye just like john he wont listen you have to listen all viruses pass on their own dna instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses this one was different it inserted a whole array of genes into john reptile genes sixty five million years old those genes remade him its not his fault that thing is john whittlesley i should have seen it before the fibers are infected with a virus you eat them and the virus alters your dna he became addicted to them in south america followed the plants back to the states he probably entered the country as a man it would have taken several months for the change to take place thats how he got from the boat to the museum no dont kill him pendergast you were right its john listen to me pendergast mbwuns dna is part homo sapien in primates the eye is a direct path to the brain if you get a clean shot theres only one place you can kill it shoot it in the eye you smell that help someone thats a ptarmigan feigning a broken wing the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest the answers right in front of us we have to try and draw it off i think for the pleasure of the kill no its still hunting but not for the hormones i think it means its full its eyesight is worse than i thought it couldnt see us and it couldnt smell us through the glass what is it doing what are you going to do is there another way around the planetarium unlock one of the other storage rooms were going upstairs well leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here we have the fibers dont you see the creature is hungry it wants the hormones in these plants it would take hundreds of human brains to supply whats in these fibers were just a poor substitute to make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants its not supernatural mbwun is an animal part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the halfgoat halfsheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam that would fit its nocturnal quick come inside wounded youre not where is it pendergast are you all right when dna is defective it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair viruses can damage dna so can radiation certain chemicals even cancer lets let the gse sort it out i have to get started this will take several hours i dont know mr pendergast do me a favor get me a dna readout on that claw all right this is hard for me im a scientist i like order and logic sometimes too much theres got to be an explanation there cant be an animal in there but i saw something i didnt imagine it i know what i saw are you sure there are enough men in there thats not what i saw behind me over there its okay im all right i remember now it was an animal something large i could smell it it was hunting me i saw two green eyes in the dark you were behind me running after me i dont know im not sure we should split up you take that hall and ill take this one i dont know he sent back a statue thats supposed to be an exact representation but ive never seen it its in the exhibit my god then it was an animal i dont understand no im all right i wont let this affect me anymore john wouldnt get help his ego endangered the lives of others his theory came first no one knows the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals yes he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect it held that evolution wasnt always gradual or driven by natural selection the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a monster species it made no sense but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years a legendary monster called mbwun he was afraid of himself he tried suicide once he was ill manic depressive he had wild emotional highs and lows not a happy affliction for a scientist hed been revered in our community by the end he was a joke that was two years ago john was still in love with me he wouldnt leave me alone how did you know that yes once we met at columbia john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there john couldnt have anything to do with a horrible thing like that he was a fine man despite his problems i dont understand and john if he were alive hed have contacted me somehow when all this happened i knew it would come back to john is he really dead with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it hunted how big it was you arent here for a lesson in dna an invention of mine its a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna i call it the genetic sequence extrapolatortruman youre gon na be late truman stop it youre the one talking to the walls do something youre having a nervous breakdown thats whats happening ive tasted other cocoas this is the best why dont i make you some of this new

bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen so their deaths and the reason for them wouldnt have to be explained yes i apologize for making you wait ive brought some new evidence with me i cant go any farther where are we cold ive got no allergy something this mulder i think i think you should call an ambulance no its my pulse feels thready and ive got a funny taste in the back of my throat somethings wrong im having lancinating pain my chest my motor functions are being affected im i think something stung me why was i assigned to you to debunk your work to reign you in to shut you down you dont mulder youve never needed me ive only held you back ive got to go im contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers i have i did its done youre on the verge mulder please dont do this to me i can mulder i debated whether or not to even tell you in person because i knew i already gave skinner my letter of resignation salt lake city utah transfer effective immediately whered they go what are you doing yeah i hear the humming like electricity high voltage maybe cool in here temperatures being regulated any thoughts on why anybodyd be growing corn in the middle of the desert this is weird mulder what do you think it is pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope only to find myself standing right where i am right now at another dead end i dont believe this i dont fucking believe this yknow ive been here ive been here one too many times with you mulder mulder what do you mean by haul what are you not telling me here they haul gas in tanker trucks they haul oil in tanker trucks they dont haul viruses in tanker trucks of what exactly ive got to be in washington dc in eleven hours for a hearing the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas chasing phantom tanker trucks this is great this is fitting i dont know why i think they went right weve got two choices one of them is wrong about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction thats the first question to answer if were going to find them i dont know mulder all the equipment is brand new it looks pretty green for this climate no it didnt show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests the bone was porous as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it i dont see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite not even a sewer or a storm drain he didnt mention a park that i dont know but if its through simple contact of blood to blood and if it doesnt respond to conventional treatments it could be a serious health threat something i couldnt show to anyone else not without more information and not without causing the kind of attention id just as soon avoid right now the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat ive never seen before what it did to them it did extremely fast and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain it survives very nicely outside the body i wasnt planning on it particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen mulder i cant im already way past the point of common sense here ive got a hearing tomorrow mulder i dont know evidence of a massive infection i cant really talk right now mulder this is going to take some time and somebodys going to figure out soon enough were not even supposed to be here im in serious violation of medical ethics youre saying the bombing was a coverup of what you knew this man didnt die at the bomb site before we got here i dont know what killed this man im not sure if anybody else could claim to either and theres been no autopsy performed theres no y incision here no internal exam theres some kind of cellular breakdown its completely edematous and youre looking for this is one of the firemen who died in dallas mulder what are you doing go home mulder its late i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting is that before or after you got the idea to come here are you drunk mulder no theres really no reason left for me to stay anymore maybe you should ask yourself if your hearts still in it too theyre not doing this mulder i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau i felt this was not an impediment but an opportunity to distinguish myself but it hasnt turned out that way and now if i were to be transferred to omaha or wichita or some field office where im sure i could rise it just doesnt hold the interest for me it once did not after what ive seen and done because they wanted me to invalidate your work your investigations into the paranormal but i think this goes deeper than that i think you must have an idea they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993 i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment they have divided us mulder theyre splitting us up all i told them was the truth mulder get in the car mulder move away from the door were coming through it hang on im gon na get you out of there mulder tell me this is a joke nice try mulder where are you mulder scully something sweet i just did youre buying i saw your face mulder there was a moment of panic oh yeah had you big time had you now what youve got to quit looking for what isnt there theyve closed the xfiles theres procedure to be followed here protocol i know youre bored in this assignment but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now jesus mulder mulder mulder when a terrorist bomb threat is called in the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror if youd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device if we dont act in accordance with that data if you ignore it as we have done the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it lives could be lost i know that but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street ive just climbed twelve floors im hot and thirsty and im wondering to be honest what im doing here no i havent im on the roof mulder its me give a kiss to edward thanks miriam say hi to henry and i dont need them anymore whats wrong baked in a pie a pocketful of rye is it cold in here no no ill be fine like a new years day hangover the first what six or seven times i went in remember what happened why did we stop a pocketful of fucking rye whats wrong ive got to feed my cat besides i want to get to bed early okay yes mother no okay okay id be there for him i do it all the time it could take years for me to get past the barriers hes created he creates the obstacles he decides which games to play miriam why not just once a trial run what harm could it do she thinks i can bring edward back he hates me mockylock is a pain in the ass almost mockylock showed up a pocketful of rye no thank you thank you theyre hungry it doesnt matter hes mine i told you you have to be optimistic believe in them good for them i heard julia and john got

follow the little boy wait okay okay youre sure of that tell me what happened what happened to charles gish if you believe that then what is he dont you feel there are different sides to every personality maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act were all human not stargher not really hes split himself right down the middle goodevil rightwrong mercifulcruel a monster and an innocent child if i could reach the boy he might tell me about julia the part of him that wants to help that feels shame and remorse who wants to be redeemed this is going to sound terrible but i dont think she matters anymore not to him he never finished her the othershe was able to make them his you were right theres a part of him that knows the truth about what he did about himself you thought stargher wanted to be caught as soon as i met him you knew id say yes he makes julia real for me whyd you bring him here a kingdom his utopia life without consequence or restriction hes not even carl stargher anymore hes this idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases without fear a horrible primitive ugly thing i dont want to talk in here with stargher i saw things just like we all have fantasies right things only we know that we dont share do you feel theres a side of yourself you dont show people agent novak the soul the spirit whatever you want to call it it doesnt have much to do with science do you think thats funny you dont know the procedure i realize that okay lets assume he wanted you to find him that some part of him hated what he was doing most likely that part is dead schizophrenics with whalens infraction sever all ties with the real world im sorry i really am really i dont work with violent cases i work with children but even a kid lies they love it when they get you to believe something that isnt true dont you think stargher would do the same what if he wasnt like this what if he was normal conscious how far would you go i bet we can fix it oh

intravenous administration complete catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy when we started there were a number of test subjects other therapists who acted as receivers all they did was observe and report nothing more but catherine she had the ability to feel what was happening she understood and the patient responded edward engaged her in dialogue took her places showed her things

wwhy are you telling me all this mr lombard huh really hotels are we understood iï½m impressed that information could have cost me ï½20000 who is friedman you lost my money last night you upset my sleep tonight my social life we have two minutes my dinner guests are waiting i still donï½t buy your story but i figured it canï½t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry besides if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner we could always get the right people onto you i trust you know who i am talking about huh who do you think we are mr lombard the family hired you and i have just fired you mr lombard laurence no youï½re fired get out of my house and take your sick tape with you get out of my house youï½re fired mr lombard no the question now is how long itï½s

time but youï½ll understand if i donï½t tell you to sit down now spare me the apology and get to the point will you mr lombard perhaps it wasnï½t so brave of him had i been here i just might have given him his money mr lombard one can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct as someone in your line of work ought to know i have too much money to work mr lombard well leon does not need money for prints mr lombard does his own printing wouldnï½t want anyone to interfere with his ï½artï½ which as he subsequently vanished raises the question what was the money for perish the thought three weeks ago to borrow money i wasnï½t here but he got to my husband sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made carlos handed over ï½1000 to get rid of him that depends what youï½re looking at now you know why youï½re here mr lombard it might be difficult for someone like you to discern but we are people of a certain standinghuh and they say

cleaned i came to feed your fish i didnï½t know sheï½s pretty see you huh oh yeah better be good and hurry away then who knows we might be being watched maybe one of your stupid french companies has got a detective prying into your life after all thatï½s what they do to their employees isnï½t it huh hope you enjoy ruining peopleï½s lives thanks for the lift oh no iï½m all right he was a jerk really another boy you know all i meet is boys when i think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls i mean is it true oh we split up so you havenï½t seen the film then i donï½t know how many famous french film directors can there be ï½la collectionooseï½ itï½s about a young girl in the south of france who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her itï½s on tv tonight and as iï½m in i thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and the review says itï½s about the conflict between intellect and instinct and witty the directorï½s supposed to be famous rommel or something french you must know him have you heard of a french film called ï½la collectionooseï½ yes but my boss reckons youï½d still be better off as a limited company for expenses and all that you know itï½d cost you about ï½100 but he said itï½d be worth it of course youï½d need a partner to register but thatï½s a formality i mean i could be your partner i mean just as a name right must be your lucky day then iï½ve got your accounts you donï½t owe much tax for last year fine how was the match did you loose hello again neighbour i didnï½t intrude did ijah ï½10000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy my husband and i will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in israel deborah will be here if you need anything before our return ha no mr lombard his monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us he knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate we are aware of your rates mr lombard we will pay you double your rates plus expenses in return need i say it again we expect discretion and undivided attention the ï½1000 is on account when iï½m told he came here the proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about his address is in this envelope with leonardï½s address keys and other things you might need no and before you ask no heï½s not gay he has had girlfriends but nothing serious he could indeed mr lombard but had he done so i think he would have let us know about it leonard does not hold a driving licence as for his passport i do not know where he keeps it yesterday it all looked normal then you should not have sought an explanation i said earlier that my husband and i are supporting leonard in his photography mr lombard by this i mean that since his return from america i have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold so as you see i did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account do what mr lombard you wouldnï½t be here if i knew mr lombard what i do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks that enquiries to the police and london hospitals have borne no results and that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now leonard what my daughter is on about mr lombard is that leonard is somewhat of a bohemian you might as well know that what i can appreciate is insolence mr lombard good now as i trust you may have guessed we are looking for someone to work for us someone whose discretion can be relied upon someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment do you think you could be that person mr lombard you may not and besides it is irrelevant must i speak to you in french whatever you come recommended we what if it is lombard this is not a jewish name is it may i ask if you are jewish mr lombard spitz we spoke on the telephone my husband my daughter deborah whose house this is my soninlaw carlos the gentleman is a business partner of hisim not afraid of the fire anymore it will purify me im staying jean one day you will my gentle captain im staying im already free i am ready now thats an order do as i say get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side not yet it would not be the same without you if god wants me to win he will find a way and if he wants me to die if he wants me back then thats fine too then ill be with him forever but it is what i want i would like to marry you but i have already promised myself to god i will ask my voices if they come back one day meanwhile im going to compiegne did you come back to marry me or to insult me no but its a trap theyre buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england what did the king say thats not what i asked why do you want to marry me tell the king to give me more men if you really want to help me theres one thing you can do so even you dont believe in me anymore the truth is always simple its you jean whos making things complicated i dont know it i feel it all you have to do is stop talking and just listen well of course theyre me thats how god talks to me if you listen hard enough even you can hear him everyone can hear him its not time yet my mission is not over yet there is still more i must do before i can really finally go home its been weeks since they spoke to me since the coronation no signs nothing theyve abandoned me like everyone so what am i supposed to do now yes yes im fine we need more brushwood why are you staring at me like that ill go yes come with me the king said youre his finest archer alright i promise to rest if you promise to go back to the battle no its its nothing its not so easily why arent you fighting go on were almost there theyve started the battle without me good what did they say how dare you tell me what god tells me to do how dare you stop me doing gods will theres nothing to hear i havent done anything and why havent i done anything because none of you will listen to me who do they think i am the king of england i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there i thought you were an archer i also need someone who can read and write better today than tomorrow i shall also be needing a war horse mine is too slow and armor and a good sword and an artist to make me a banner yes i didnt confess today and i would like to see a priest i would like some fresh straw do you think i could have some water no i i never killed anyone yes maybe i dont remember no i i held it up to yes but yes probably maybe no i warned the english to go back home i begged them not to force us to fight they knew the defeat i would bring on them why didnt they listen to me no of course not i never killed anyone to avoid killing anyone and so i i prefer my banner no its just a sword is a weapon i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword yes quite a few i leave the answer to god i cant read no i said surrender in the name of the king of france i dont know i dont remember maybe i tried to i dont know but youre all men of the church why not ask him yourself go onto the next question no but my revelations were for the king of france not for you no i wont tell you more about that im more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you god defeated the english not me my king will pay any ransom you ask where where am i am i am i dead but where are you going to be what about you i was talking to the priest and do you know what he said to me no no im fine really i ask only one thing to hear me in confession its not my body i want to save its my soul and you why did you lie you promised i could be confessed i didnt mean it i didnt know what i was signing you tricked me please may i have it back and may i go to mass no i want to be confessed i am sent by god and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment or do you think that you are better judges than he is so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me and so prevents me from being a good christian yes many things yes praying last night not long ago these questions have nothing to do with your trial and you be careful you who claim to be my judges for you too will be judged one day not unless you hear my confession not unless you hear my confession yes in the church at domremy in a village called domremy my name is jeanne my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me i would like to have it back i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you but as to the rest even if you threaten to cut off my head i still wont tell you i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things but as for my revelations ive never told anyone except my king charles the seventh the one and only king of france i dont know what youre going to ask me questions about you may ask things that i wont want to answer the english but the king my king didnt he pay my ransom trial what trial who are you oh thank you lord im so glad to see you i need to confess i havent been confessed since easter or been to mass will you hear me now peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance so how would you put it why did you betray me paris was ours for the taking all i needed was another few hundred men why did you take back the army you gave me get them out of here you look wonderful i dont need lodgings if were to be marching on orleans he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god and he told me that i jeanne will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france i didnt wait long one day i was going to mass like i do every day when the same strange wind started blowing again what was my mission to help my country but how could i do that i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it i know youre not yet but you will be soon theres no need to be afraid sire go on to the next question im more interested in what he says not what he looks like yes his face go and ask him yourself if there was i didnt see it not yet the bridge wont wait stand by with the batteringrams i know what im doing so either lend a hand or go back to bed were taking back the tourelles the wind will be with us do as i say position the longbows over there crossbows over there and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees sooner is better than later dunois was it you who ordered the attack answer me knowing what i know enormous gratitude ah so thats it to you im just a girl be patient be patient is that the only advice you can ever come up with ive shown more patience than a dozen saints what complicated about it all you have to do is do what youre told what could be simpler than that im the drum on which god is beating out his message beating so loudly its bursting my ears but youre all so full of your own voices youre deaf to his you know i feel a great sorrow for you because youre laughing now but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god god we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace if they refuse we recross the river and attack them here at the tourelles you may have been with your counsel but ive been with mine and im telling you gods counsel is wiser than yours and hes telling me to speak to the english now because if they dont ill raise such a warcry against them that they will remember us forever for what good can you bring me to him its coming i rode on ahead i have to speak with the captain of the english army his names talbot good where are the english were you sent by lord dunois but my voices they promised me but where is dunois where are the men the king promised me of course i do bring them up never look behind only ahead right behind us dunois with another then thousand men so bring up the reinforcements i know but so is the enemy theyre falling back paris is ours maybe i dont know but first we have to confess i care and i care because god cares all life is precious to god even his even yours and mine no not like this clear the english are rebuilding it we return to orleans across the bridge at the tourelles i dont think i leave that to god im nothing in all this im just the messenger it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same why must you complicate what is so simple i submit to our lord it was just more convenient as i was among soldiers the clothes are not important no yes but i know but thats not the way things happened thats now what i meant no no i had been sold to the english id rather die than fall into their hands here take this instead thats different i mean we were fighting for a for a cause because because you just cant but you cant just kill a man for his teeth stop it what are you doing you dont believe me anymore i said kneel a few teeth thats the price of his life if you kill him you kill me take mine instead here smash mine first its not possible you call this glory all this this blood this smell of we won not for long prepare these as batteringrams id sooner die than use magic dont swear were the men confessed where are the priests what happened who gave the order to attack they will and so will you if you go on swearing like that then lord dunois show me the way to the other side of the river la hire im warning you dont swear so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god wouldnt you say yes i was given a few but i never had time to wear them no five steeds and a few hackneys my king yes a halfsteed white yes my lord no yes yes i am theres nothing for me to do here anymore i dont belong here i want to be with him now are you sent by god are you going to leave me too my voices my voices do you think they will ever come back love your enemies no i because because i dont know what else to do to please him im trying to make my cross look more beautiful i i cleaned up my room look and i said my prayers all of them and i never took pleasure in hurting anyone why are you doing this to me do you get pleasure from hurting me no i do not think so i dont think that killing each other will ever bring peace i i was defending myself as best i could everyone has the right to defend themselves dont they or should i have let myself be killed yes we fought and killed in his name the king of heaven no but why didnt he stop it or did he get pleasure watching us killing each other in his name yes yes and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place if hes so powerful he said hes the creator of heaven and earth the source of all life he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery why didnt he stop stop i cant remember the battles were all so confusing there was so much smoke dust noise i was being attacked on all sides so maybe perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself no i dont want to know anymore leave me alone i didnt kill that man im not lying i i cant remember leave me alone but it didnt just get there by itself like like the wind and the clouds and the bells and what about that sword lying in the field that was a sign no but he sent me so many signs yes lots of things because because ive always been faithful to god and ive followed everything he said and ive done everything he asked me what do you mean they wont come because i have to be alone no no you cant stay or they wont come yes thats what i pray for my visions yes what are you doing here please leave you cant stay here i dont understand what do you want from me i dont know i dont care anymore i just want to be at peace no no im just so tired and lost and i didnt realize what i was doing i am true to my lord the king of heaven he knows how much i love him thats all that matters to me i i never lied everything prison humiliation being abandoned and betrayed by everyone i cant stand it anymore id rather die i im leaving i cant take anymore what are you doing out here i dont know what do you want from me i dont know please tell me im dead i dont know i thought no no im just a messenger he needs me a higher calling who who are you i i i playing i want to be at one with him now i want to be with him always i dont want to wait for his call then what will and what will bring her back and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me why didnt he take my life instead of hers it was my fault i was late she gave me her hiding place i know jesus says to love our enemies but i cant i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever why did she have to die he says he says i must be good and help everyone and take care of myself do you think hes coming from the sky beautiful he never says his name well i try and talk to him but mostly hes the one who does the talking i feel safe here and its where i can talk to him yes it is oh yes i play with them lots oh yes my sisters

youre through get your things and get out two weeks work gone for nothinglooks like at the end of the day we finally find out whos better than who dont we epps like i said i expected more from you give it to me if i dont answer hell know somethings up i have to answer him theyll kill you you wont make it ten feet before they cut you down thats just what things came to sometimes you cant help that it doesnt change me respecting you and now you let me down i expected more from you you know i really did i expected you to you disappoint me epps always figured you to be a man a real bright guy i had respect for you thanks for taking care of this for me look i know you guys are telling the truth its just the shiites dont know that i guess you could tell thembut then you dont speak the language do you sure and i guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with in the flack jacket still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat took the air right out of me but i was just unconscious for awhile course you didnt stick around to find that out you left me for dead nothing about him unless hes got a problem about me dealing with you then i suppose itd be insurrection and i suppose id have to kill you i suppose im the ones got the big stick without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge no navicom a lot of good you are now epps what if i do in the service you do but were not particularly in the service right now way i see it what were doing that doesnt particularly give you the right to toss orders around youve got an awful lot of orders in you always giving orders get out of my way then step aside its a combat action im not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around i have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you dont have the stomach to do what has to be done he tried to kill us if not just now then in the helicopter thats all the authority i need were at war hes an enemy soldier you dont know he isnt thats what he says he could be a spy or something we cant just leave him hell run back to his outfit report our position i dont care what he says he wanted our gold would have slit our throats if he had the chance hehe could have been watching us says he wanted food liar he wanted the gold says they were deserters they were afraid to fight dont believe in saddam anyway they flew the gunship up here to hide out when they saw us they figured we were going to kill them so they shot first i told you dont push me around i told you he tried to steal our gold he tried to kill us he snuck in here thinking we were asleep only i wasnt sleeping would have slit our throats if i hadnt stopped him you got no reason to hit me im getting tired of you and jaeger pushing me around you got no reason to do that maybe i dont need your ideas maybe i can do better on my own maybe youve got ideas of your own for the gold maybe youve already got things worked out youre the one with all the ideas what if we get separated way i see it if something happens i want to be carrying my share maybe we should split it up now what about the gold you ready ready when you are epps what am i supposed to do missile and they cant fly around out there forever weird they didnt chase us whered they go otherwise whatever were looking for could be anywhere what do you figure it to be the us army always an adventure probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here worn down to nothing now and find the treasure and get it and get back to the humvee and get the hell out of iraqi without getting our heads blown off but thats about it we cant just go off and we can fight thats what were here for to fight the iraqis to help the shiites and the khurds the soldiers are going to kill those people yeah should have at least gotten the map off of him blows up with him then we did all this for nothing what if its a valloro 69 just going to bounce right up out of the ground explode in the air kill him and us for climbing should have blown already delayed fuse thats vietnam stuff what kind of mine hes an idiot and hes not nearly as hard as he thinks not much chance of that jaegers an idiot him getting us stranded out here doesnt do much good either what are you doing deserters would have run they wouldnt have engaged we shouldnt have been here epps there is a war going on oh jesus theyve stopped they stopped what are we going to do no please not again id settle for being alive really alive would be fine what oh god youre out of your minds you know that both of you you dont even know if theres anything out there what the hell are you thinking damn this is sweet we are going to be home in no time its a map i think thats what it is whats it say paper well based on my knowledge of the region its culture and her people i would have to say its a box i didnt learn arabic because we were getting shipped here you dont learn it in a couple of weeks i studied it in high school and its very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone its considered offensive think were going to do it think were going to war you actually got around to killing someone im impressed i guess youre only half a bitch when my shiite friends saw that they had shot an american they were very apologetic turns out weve been kicking ass in this little war they figure weve finally gotten saddam off their backs they brought me to their camp cleaned me up fed me im their new best buddy america number one joe but theres something the shiites cant figure out they cant figure out why my two buddies two fellow americans left me out in the desert they cant seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an iraqi outpost its almost as if they were iraqi spies or something and ive got to tell you they hate anything thats got to do with the iraqis see how i mean probably shot a few scattered the rest murderers the white reflects the sun it keeps you cooler thats why they wear them you want to say some words hed just slow us down and drink our water and if we ran into any more iraqis you know hed sell us out im not wasting my water on him all last night he could have been says hes one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter hes a soldier he doesnt need a weapon hes got rocks hes got bare hands what the hell are you doing what do you see you down its got a bottom what do you think just seems weird they didnt chase us we make it or we go back empty handed youre the one wanted to kill iraqis so bad were american soldiers we dont abandon people we have to do something is there anything you do know those people down there are shiites youve got shiites in the south of iraq and khurds in the north neither of themve got much love for saddam probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some im getting tired of you riding me jaeger if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself you want to crawl crawl havent found a mine for half a mile or more how long we going to keep this up doesnt matter were not going to be able to get him off it anyway really what is that an order private you two dont even know how crazy you are you want to go on your sick little treasure hunt then go ahead but mark me absent then lets go back while we still can so you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere we just about got killed you know what happened we just about got killed and you want to go on we have to go back we got to get out of here i thought we were dead i think im going to throw up i am im going to toss oh jesus oh god this is too much you dont even have the money and youre wasting it if theres gold if how the hell should i know how much i dont know it would be small easy to transport and hide gold or jewels probably gold if if theres a treasure oh no were going to get court martialed you know that god i dont believe im doing this i dont youre insane if you think youll find anything and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive epps youre smarter than this jaeger i understand but youre smarter so you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase its crazy tell him its crazy epps its not a hundred miles its a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain pure desert mountains a river if the map is even real you dont know where the iraqis have moved to and our forces havent even engaged the republican guard yet we dont know youre not saying what i think youre saying i cant believe youre even thinking it what those soldiers have got loafers on what kind of army gives their soldiers loafers its a container break the seal the longer the air force hits the iraqis the safer itii be for us when we have to engage this is so weird its happening but its not its like a tv show and were part of it you ever think about it you ever worry you ever think about dying jaeger why would they do all that if we werent were going to war arent we if theyre doing all that it must mean were going to war theyre cancelling all leaves all passes no more drills we stand at full ready starting thats in two days you know the fifteenth is the deadline for the iraqis to get out of kuwait jaeger you really think theres a treasure inside you will youll get it you get it yet and youre the guy whos going to open it its a puzzle box if you can figure out how to open it theres supposed to be a treasure inside he says its a box now you need me dont even try it you offend a woman out here youre in serious trouble dont shoot me im friendly you can use that when you surrender i thought it would be good to know im just trying to help you guys out it doesnt hurt to know something about saudi arabia come on youre going to get us in trouble im saying dont do it accidently people were suffering in afganistan and we didnt do anything i dont think well

through this i am on the board of my sons school i had a fundraiser for alv in my front yard i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman arnie i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass what is he being charged with arnie this is crazy why are you talking like that arnie thank god tell me what to do carl i need guidance not a fucking platitude im not bringing a

a village square a green with trees and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister across the green a big grey wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above a small garden and next to it a livery stable with old carriages lined up inside but clear so very clear for the first time all of it it was the tower again and the bell and the old spanish village i didnt wake him i dont

room there is a room and i sit there alone always alone vaguely there is so little i know it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored and fragments of mirror still hang there dark and shadowy reflecting a dark image of me and yet not me someone else in other clothes of another time doing things i have never done but still me and i cant stop to ask why i must keep on walking at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness and i know when i walk into the darkness ill die but ive never come to the and ive always come back before then except once and youll

slept long what happened to me i have a headache ah pleased to meet you im going to the hen house are you coming with me its very wicked to spy why did you do it how did you see me what could i trouble you for my glass of milk good morning rita how are we today hellogot it i dont set policy you have the key i need your help there is no way parker killed those guards no way captain im afraid of how smart sid 67 is but im even more afraid of whats hes becoming im not sure my guess is thats what sid wants us to think i should have told him until we know what new influences are affecting him we cant be sure any sign of lindenmeyer the man played judge jury and executioner with eight peoples lives he lost control and is capable of doing it again letting a lunatic like parker barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse at some point he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator the risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous whats the assignment ms deane you wanted to see me then fix it talk so i can understand turn it down show me his physical sensory level whats wrong with parker what do we do now duck i couldnt tell you lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had i dont know my guess is dead more or less you okay thats why im asking youve already fulfilled the terms of your pardon you stopped sid 67 and youve got his module youre free to go ï½ï½ right now why are you going to do this can i ask you something find out anything thanks im not sureon the bridgethe guy at the payphone that or living through him if we find sid lindenmeyer wont be far behind sid 67 isnt grimes the rallys a little obvious as a target dont you think i was wrong and i was wrong not to tell you grimes was part of sid i should have told you i wont make the same mistake again youre not capable of it how did you find out about the toxin he didnt know about the neural toxin i did we know you didnt kill those guards no grimes isnt back hes only one part of sid sid 67 is a hell of a lot worse than grimes ever was get a hold of yourself parker ï½ stop stop dont make me shoot youï½ï½ which way you could have just flashed him your badge you know its not just sid 67s performances that are increasing stars need bigger and bigger audiences whatever sid is going to do next its going to involve media i dont know yet what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale not decreasing whatever it is he isnt finished whatever he was doing here was only the start im doing the best i can this isnt a game parker enjoying yourself what did you do to those people what the hells going on dont get out of the car i ruin so many moments by analyzing them when i should just be living them dammit i hate sounding so clinical all the time all i meant to say was i thought you were doing well but then i you know considering youve only been out of prison for seven hours youre reï½adapting quite well wait i didnt mean that the way it sounded i meant what i do know is that whatever hes becoming sid 67 is going to be even worse than he was before now that hes in the real world there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality sid is going to evolve sid 67 is no longer bound by his programming i told you it was on the way and i wanted to change clothes thankyou her name is karin i prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life how did you get your hand out and im going to make sure of it give me your wrist give me your wrist in order to find him we have to understand what makes him tick dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory we need to get a look at sid 67s final profile as a matter of fact it is but rather than selecting pieces from each individual he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weaker ones lindenmeyer put increasingly complex combinations of criminal psychological profiles together to develop the ultimate villain hes part of the mix sid 67 is a composite who said that i am impressed i am the demon from the bottomless pit the government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids brains im still working on it this lindenmeyers a real piece of work checking my pulse its elevated you enjoy frightening me dont you youve got a problem with me carrying a gun every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers stay here he had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 all he did day and night was play the violin ive spent over 50 hours interviewing him charlie killed leno and rosemary labianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered sharon tate after seeing the blood bath on television he wanted to show them how it should be done the question is what does charlie have to do with sid 67 whoever did this wanted to do charlie one better ï½ï½ to improve upon what was already done he was reï½enacting charles mansons labianca murders you ready for this you all right it wasnt a lie what you need is a collar i need to know what snapped in you what made you capable of it you have to make me understand it was just like before wasnt it wasnt it but you are making progress instead of killing seven people to get the one youre after this time there was only one other person involved you didnt see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger but i did you kind of liked it didnt you that thrill of going over the edge again of taking out an innocent bystander or two as long as you got the target what was going through your mind when you killed the busboy thats not true parker i know i was there i saw the whole thing if i was your therapist i would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation in other words par for the course how do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday no i just like the effect a tape recorder has on you how you feeling todayhes dead hes dead the fella killed old shoe what are you talking about the harvester im concerned about the driver of the rig but how do we explain the fact he was in prison how do we explain that with the world watching you cant tell this story hes not

last night we found her car at the bus terminal but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket suzie toller is missing werent you a little worried about her did you call anyone did you call her house to see if she got home did you call the masons and when you turned her toward the door where did you expect her to go without a car id like that its homicides job now ray let em do it ill tell you something else theres more to this story than you know ray if suzie is dead i think hunter may be on the right track hes leaving the country and i dont give a shit im tired ray im going home and if the teeth arent suzies youll give this up ray you heard him we dont know that ray her grandmother said shed been threatening to run away and i found the car at the miami bus terminal wheres the body two kids couldve gotten into a fight lost a couple of teeth if you want company you have someplace to be ray we dont know anything yet she could be anywhere we all have you could say that which she might have saved if she hadnt set out to destroy the mans life whered you come up with this stuff anyway eliminate the competition this ones got you working overtime hasnt it so what about the girls suzies poor but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother surely her father why you ask me lombardo had it pretty good already nice job in a beautiful setting popular an active social life hes gon na put this all on the line for some dicey play like what youre describing unless what maybe lombardos attorney was saving the affair for the trial lombardos settlement thats what they called it when i was in juvenile its a pretty dismal place you mean camp sixtynine the skinny brunette you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark you know what you get more bark and more bark theres no core trees not good tar anything but sucking up water and now they cant get rid of them theyve tried poisons nothing works they dont die all im saying is we let sandra van ryan push us too hard were going to wind up looking stupid we failed to mention the mower guys a drunk that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house so he cant say how long she was in there same with the kids they saw her running down the street but thats it with no physical evidence what do we have her word against his same as him they saw her come they saw her go they saw him follow hunters making it our job because sandra van ryans got a bug up his ass you know that as well as i do were gon na trash this guys life and i keep asking myself if its really necessary all im saying is i think we should go slow here back to the land of grownups what was that at that point were you able to fight him off did he come in with you so you were alone and when he arrived at your house was anyone there he dropped jimmy off first we need to tape the interview suzie no one will see it but us now when was this that mr lombardo gave you the ride why is that that bothers you you know what that will mean for lombardo i worked juvenile in dade county for three years we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks maybe a year ago the family kept it out of the papers that doesnt make him a child rapist theres something else this girls had some problems wrecked a couple of her moms cars ran away i think shes acting i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her i think maybe shes upset that he didnti know one thing he said it was when when he took himself out and was standing up he said dont worry i didnt come i cant forget that he said no little girl can ever make me come not at first he was still inside but he wasnt moving or anything he said we had this secret and that now hed be able to help me because we were close something like that i

there was a time when i thought you might have stayed you should not bother with that birdhouse if youre leaving tomorrow i see but i hope you have a lot of sugar eli is ready to go to zooks when will you be going but you may not be well enough im sorry im sure it is whacking is not of much use on a farm what else can you do you know carpentry we had some lemonade and he left eli is a fine carpenter best in the district he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago oh the bullets you can go with eli hes taking samuel to school but youll have to hurry but stoltzfus said well the store at saltzburg but you wont be going to saltzburg for a while telephone the gunthers across the valley theyre mennonite they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even you make fun of me like the tourists driving by all the time some even come into the yard very rude they seem to think we are quaint vain proud such a person is hochmutsnarr he is not plain buttons are hochmut i should tell you these do not have buttons see hooks and eyes yes its good that someone can have the use of them besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these enjoying your reading its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for that is not for samuel john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible you tell him when youre able but you cant two days what only the elders the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life but ï½

you couldnt wait until morning where are you taking us now im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home but why would they murder why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything and youre the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks youre afraid

have nothing to do with your laws you have no right to keep us here where are you taking us samuel samuel lapp but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is
