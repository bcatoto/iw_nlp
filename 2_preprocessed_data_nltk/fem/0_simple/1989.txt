You're not taking my baby! What are you talking about? My "condition"?... Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility. What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him. It's okay, Dan But how...? What do you mean? Where is he? Come on downstairs. He won't hurt you. He needs us both. Who says I don't like you? Who said I...wait, what? Oh...I'm sure that's not true. I'll bet she's very worried about you. I would be. I don't think this is a nice place for you to be. Maybe we should go find your Mom. Is that who you're waiting for? Hi, you don't look very well. Are you feeling all right? How did you know that? My name is... Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob? Huh? Me too. You're right. Yeah...I guess. No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared. Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony. I know. The tickets. Jesus! Don't do that! But Dad -- I've got to go. You disappointed in me? Since when are you such a smart shopper? Very funny. How was the meeting? Daddy, he's coming back...Krueger's coming back. Make them understand. It's just across the park. Thanks for everything, Dad. To take a picture. Dad! That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings. I was afraid you weren't coming. That's okay. He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep. So did Dan. We've got to go to the asylum and find her body. Mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that's why she can't come to me. It must be! Jacob. We've got to get to Amanda before it's too late. If they actually bothered to bury her. Are you alright? That's the only reason you're alive... Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams. What do you think I'm doing? Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will?? Krueger is reality. I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake... Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands. I think Krueger's trying to do something to it. I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it? No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger. What's that got to do with it? Did everyone call everyone? He must've wandered up from the children's ward. I just wondered what was wrong with him. Have you visited the little boy on my floor? Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad? It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way. Good to see you again, Mr. Grey. I've got to go find Dan. No, the Dan part was nice... Had kind of a long night. I don't understand. Poor woman... But I've seen her grave. Meaning? No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob. You said she committed suicide? They think I'm nuts. I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him. Where are you going? I don't know! My baby! Why don't I go make some coffee. There's a lot to tell. It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party. Nobody thinks that. Mark! She must've fallen asleep at the table... I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And... Mark, are you okay? That's why it's my fault Dan's dead. My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house. Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis. Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here. In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability -- And ours. It's our grandchild. Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby? Excuse us, dear.He sure loves to stay awake. You do good work, Alice. But how are we gonna -- What? You think that's the place she's buried? Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy. Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night... All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while? And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now! I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality. I really think you need to calm down now, okay? Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself... You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby? Why don't you two stick to reality. It was just an accident. Like with Dan. When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so. End of story. They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me. There aren't any little boys on your floor. Alice, it's no dream. I'm sorry...Dan's dead. Yeah, before they revoke his diploma. Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl. Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile. All of us. Right? Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are. Stop saying that, it's bullshit. Naah, I'm done. Got to be on shift in a couple hours. Aren't you going in? That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done. All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today... Makes you look like a nun-- You, too? It's okay. I can't listen to this. Mark... Vomit? Two hours a day, six days a week.Maybe. If I come visit, we can find out. Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head. Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich. I still think you're a bastard. Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not. You'll get Ich killed. The cheese... This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson... They want your autograph. I don't remember saying yes. 'Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course. I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant. You met her. He's got a reason. You're wrong to sell Ich short. And I'm supposed to care? My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in. I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood. Where's Ich? Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice. I paid for that. Don't be an ass. She ever pull down her shades? I don't think so. Look, you need Ich. I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs. You have a helluva way of asking for help. I don't give tours. An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you. Dead gaiijin's are big news. Ich said you left. He gets as much as he wants.It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking! But, Father, it IS! It's your fantasy... There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic... It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other.... You're losing your temper! There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself. There IS no one. Who, Father? Ah! It's my father! I don't want to live WITHOUT you. Then I shall come too. No living man has ever set foot in the Halls of Asgaard... The Gods will never let you return. Blow the third note! The note to take us home! Erik! You've done what you came to do! The second note. Then let go! You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU? Do you believe I love you? YOU still want to go to Asgaard? No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength. No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us. No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father! But you don't realize.... Erik. You don't understand. No! Why? I mean, you could have killed yourself. But, Erik... Who? You're as bad as my father. That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE... Oh, for goodness' sake! The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift. I've never LOVED anybody! Why do you go on about that? What does it matter? But you LOVED her all the same... What was she like? What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before... No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams? No, of course not, silly -- I mean FELT like this about them? Have you ever felt like this about anyone else? But surely you know...? WHY? Put them down! PLEASE make them put them down. PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing! Those things in your hands. Please! Please! What are those? Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil. Well, of course. We always welcome friends. I said welcome.Please. What d'you expect me to do? Yeah... well... Bye, Leif.Why should you care? You'll have to wait till he's finished his game. Have you tried to ask the God for anything? What's the point of being dead in the land of the living? What a stupid idea. Why... should YOU care? I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable... Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts... Thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death. Aaagh! Rape! Ah. And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on. Well you started it. But that's a circular argument! If the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out. Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting? What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it? You DON'T like it, do you? About raping me? What d'you expect? You come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me... What? Oh, get it over with. What -- rape? You don't love ME. It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life. What about the raping? Looting and pillaging, eh? Have you done this sort of thing before?I'd rather not. I hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul. I could never forgive what you've done to me and my child. We don't have a relationship. I don't care who he is. He's not taking my baby. Everybody has a choice. If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it. What do you want with my baby? Oh, I'm sorry. This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha. Good night, Janosz. No, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks anyway. Janosz? I'm sorry. Perhaps some other time. Actually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have an appointment. In fact, I'd better go. Thank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, I was hoping to rejoin the orchestra. Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz. Thank you. Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind. This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me? Does he ever mention me? How is he these days? Do you ever see him? Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman. What are you working on, Egon? Hundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't imagine this. That's exactly what you said last week. No, you didn't, Frank. Thank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you last week. Thank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this eventually. You're also a human being, Frank. Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags? That's a terrible thing to say. That's not true. It was 1620. I think he likes you. I think I do too. Maybe I should call Janine. So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000? Why do you say things like that? You're so much better than you know. Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had to protect myself. You really weren't very good for me, you know. For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real? I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me. I put them in your hamper. I thought they were dirty. Okay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner. Does she know anything about babies? I'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know. They didn't find anything? In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do I do now? Yes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything at my apartment? Thank you. Poor baby. I think I should put him down now. How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby. Really? And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements? Peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know. It was full of this awful pink ooze. Peter, what about the bathtub? I don't know what to do anymore. I must be losing my mind. At the museum today I could have sworn that terrible painting of Vigo looked right at me. Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar. I'm sorry. Were you on your way out? Good-bye, Peter. He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting. I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage. I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art. I didn't paint it. I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer. It's worth about ten million dollars. Oh, hello, Peter. Good luck. You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug? Please don't say that. You won't go to prison. I wish I could stay. I feel personally responsible for you being here. That's where the buggy stopped. We definitely had a moment or two. I'll do it. Peter, this is serious. I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him. His name is Oscar. What do you think? Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left. You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep. He didn't "ditch" me. We had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in England and he took it. I have. That's why I didn't call you first. Hello, Peter. Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things. A little to the left. Right there! That's where it stopped. Hi, Egon. Hi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for coming.You're very brave, Louis. Good luck. I'm not sure this is such a good idea? Do they know you're doing this? I don't think we should leave her alone. Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me. I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you? You're really good with children, Louis. I can tell. Why don't you come here and sit with me? It's really not a bad place. It just needs a woman's touch. I can't believe a person could actually live like this. I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit. Do you want to babysit with me? Well, good night, Louis. That's very practical. I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too. Have you made any plans yet? You know tomorrow is New Year's Eve. Why would you want to be a Ghostbuster if you're already an accountant? What are you doing up here? Who are you going to call? It's that darn ghost again! I don't know what to do anymore. He just won't leave us alone. I guess we'll just have to move.I can reach it. I can reach it... It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine. I never expected to see you again. All I have to do is scream. You do. Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika. You came back for the book? Why? How did you get here? This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon. How do you know? What are you going to do? I know the Brunwalds are famous art collectors. It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier. No? Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere. You had it? You didn't trust me! The Grail Diary. What were they looking for? My room! You said go between them! What? Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this? What's that? Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork. Are you sure? The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later. Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century. Lower me down. You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father. Find something? But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded. In that case, I permit you. I usually don't. The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy. Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for. I knew it was you -- Doctor Jones?He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair-- Is that right, dad? Yes-- What if you can't read what's written on there anymore? Well...I guess not. Bite? But where are we going, Mr. Crandall? I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to. Please hurry. Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay? He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost. Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He-- Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late! Paxcow says it's almost too late! I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy! But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary? Yaay! Am I really gonna have my own room? Do you swear? Come with us, daddy. Please come with us! And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and... Then why do I have to go to bed? I'm not tired! Yeah, sure. I don't get it. You believe in it. Do you believe that? Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose. I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think? At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell. Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven? Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever! No more chocolate chip cookies. She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy-- I hate that smell. Because you promised. Is he really all right? Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary. Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair. Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation! It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks! In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he? That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much. To remember. I want to look around, daddy-- may I? Well, I thought it was safe-- Yayyy! Hurrts! It hurrrrts! Yaay!I will. Come and kiss me. Of course I will. There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense. Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman? Ellie...Ellie...what... In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn. Honey, Church will be fine. Yes, but the rope might be-- It's gorgeous! Don't bother. I'm coming home. Was it Pascow? Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car? How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children! Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. Louis, are you sure? Oh Louis, I just don't know about this-- I'm going to try to do better. Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know. I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard. That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda. I heard you tonight. I got eggs down here! Thank you, Louis. Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise. You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face. I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place. That's enough of that kind of talk! Don't be silly. Church is not going to die. Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die. It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it. She's finally asleep. Extraordinarily morbid, maybe. It's beautiful! ---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and--- You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you? Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? Thank you. Thank you so much. Gage's gone! Come on--let's parole 'em. Louis, the house is beautiful.Graham... I want to touch you. But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did? I want to know why you are the way you are! You're not answering me. Why are you ashamed? Come on!! I don't care. I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape. "Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel? Why not? Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine. Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right? Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something. Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed? Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her? Like maybe a big part? But that was part of it? Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again? But you're planning to be? You mean you're still in contact with her? Who? Elizabeth? But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig -- But I don't understand -- Why not? I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you? So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean? But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you. But if you were? If you were in love with me, would you? You're really never going to make love again? Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!! God, I m so mad at him!! I'm babbling. Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables. Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself. I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no... Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out. I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong. Don't you get lonely? And now you can? How come? So you lied to her? What was the problem? So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off? Who was the last person you had sex with? So you have had sex. You said you weren't always impotent. Can't or won't? Why not? On tape? If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean? I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me? Have you fantasized about me? Yes. I fantasized about you. Yes. I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has. Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!! Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!! No. I guess not. Yes, I have. I will. I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want. I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this... Yes. Is he going to see this? You don't know what I'm thinking. Sometimes. Afterward. When we're making love? Ann Bishop Millaney. Ann Bishop Millaney. Yes. What will you do when the money runs out? How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment. Then do it. What do you have to do to get ready? What would you know about a normal frame of mind? What difference does it make why I do it? Don't you want to make one? Why not? Why didn't you tell me? How did you know? You know? John and Cynthia have been... "fucking". I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know. Yes, I do. This is just... so... I don't... why... why do you do this? To you? And they just answer them? You just ask them questions? Like what? What about sex? About sex? What... what are these interviews about? Why not? Can we look at one? All of these are interviews? You went out with her? Donna. On this tape it says "Donna". Who's Donna? What kind of personal project? I can see that. What are they? What are these? Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time. I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished. Are you in the middle of something? Hi! So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice. Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right? Excuse me for asking, but how would you know? Of course not. Well, my therapist knows me intimately. So you don't believe in therapy? Aren't you? My therapist said that -- What? Why do you say I'm self-conscious? Well... are you self-conscious about it? Does it bother you? You are? You're what? As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you. So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal? I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking. Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now. Kids? What about them? Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do. I'm getting confused. Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway. Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John. I feel like they do. Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes. Okay, I will!! Would you mind? What's the first? Who's Elizabeth? Younger. Mother, father, sister. Thank you. That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different. Why'd you drop out? Why? Didn't you know him well? Nine years? How long has it been since you've seen John? You mean like "time flies"? Oh, uh-huh. Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed. ...free-lance. You know. Well... well, the clich� about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some... Oh, I like it. I like it very much. You play an instrument? No, not really. Well... No, I think you look... fine. Oh, uh-huh. Graham is an unusual name. No. Why? Television? Oh. Do you have other things? We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you -- Oh. Well, please sit down. That was quick. Yes? Yes. I have thought about it, yes. Not very often. He does. Yes. Yes! I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense. No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off. I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham. We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out. I want out of this marriage. I want out of this marriage. I know. I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world. I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced. Loud. I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why. You've made your point. Always the lawyer. Why don't I believe you? But I'm not. Is that supposed to comfort me? My sister, for one. Is that who it is? I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying. If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying. Well, are you? Are you having an affair? Who'd you have lunch with? That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message. Did you see a message to call me when you got back in? I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were? John? Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff. Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree. You did that? I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex. Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that? I hate my sister. But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right? Yes. Not really. Yes. Yes. I guess. What do you mean? I don't understand. That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff. I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me. I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him. After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room. What do you mean, like physically? No, he left last week. Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know? What visitor? Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you. I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants. Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this? Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and -- Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently. Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know? God, no. What do you mean? But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself. Oh, yeah. But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden. About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me. Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me. Yeah, I know. I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage. No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked. Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke. Yeah, so? What do you mean? Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening? Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go. Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day? Bye. I get real busy between two and four. Do you have my work number? Well. I can't stay. Thirty-two dollars. I was just trying to -- It does not. It's a sun dress. Here it is. I don't want to discuss it. You are in serious trouble. So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird? That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted. You know what I mean, you don't even know him! I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even. I can't believe you did that!! You are in trouble. You touched him? Did he touch you? You don't know that for sure. Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it. But why did you want to? Why did you do that? Cynthia! Did he ask you to take your clothes off? Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister? Well, like what did he ask, exactly? What kinds of questions? I don't know. I don't want to talk about it. No, he's not dangerous. Not physically. No, it's nothing like that. No! Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him. Because I never got around to it. No, I didn't. I don't... he doesn't want you to come over. I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore. Fine. I just thought it might -- Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday -- A card? For her fiftieth birthday? Are you getting Mom something for her birthday? Lose something? And... do whatever it is you do. I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and... Let me talk to him first. He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone. But he won't. He doesn't have a phone. I have a pretty good idea. Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type. Well, I wonder why. Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway. You know what. You say it just to irritate me. Do you have to say that? Why, so you can go after him? Why? Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual. No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange. I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around. So will you, someday. It was busy. I wish you'd get an answering machine. Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him. Did you take your clothes off?Bye. Okay. No. Thank you. So what's my share of the dress? Hold on. It looks like a tablecloth. What is it? Then why do you keep asking about it? Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you? No. I don't think they all did what I did. He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal? I feel like I do. You couldn't do it, period. Why? Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about? In front of him, Ann, yes. No, but I did. Well, it's too late now, isn't it? He wouldn't do that. I wanted him to see me. Because I wanted to. What!? Yes, I did. Apparently. Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly. Questions about sex. He just asked me questions. Then why'd you call me? Well, what, then? Well, what? Is he dangerous? Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what? What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you? Well, why? Why not? What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me? Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work. Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right? Will you stop? Jesus. What's wrong with that? I don't know, I'll get her a card or something. That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune. And what? Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved. Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by. What are you talking about? Well, I'll call him when he does. Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself. "My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is? I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me. Ann, you always underestimate me. I say it because it's descriptive. What? Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours? Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like. I just want to know what he looks like, is all. Uh-huh. So what's he look like? Is he? Strange, I mean? Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John? Goddamit, give me my tape, then. I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me. Well, what the hell am I supposed to do? How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know? So make an exception. But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything. Now who the hell is going to do that for me? I can't talk you into it? No? Not even one more? I'd like to make another tape. Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay? Hi. He doesn't have to tell me. John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore. Prettier than Ann? Do you think I'm pretty? Do you like the way I look? Would you like me to take my pants off? Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking. He said that my hand felt good. It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me. No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know? Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube. Very much live. When I was fourteen. No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually. I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished. My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse? Cynthia Patrice Bishop. I'd rather sit. Are you ready? Do I sit or stand? Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what -- How long will it take? And you ask questions, right? How do we start? Would anybody else see the tape? Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences? And that's all? You just want to ask me questions? What makes you think I'd discuss that with you? About what? Doing what? Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it? Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something? Oh, okay. I think I get it. I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened. Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something. I, uh, know a guy at the power company. Nope. Nope. Nope. She still is. Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest. You want me to leave? She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud. I'm Ann Millaney's sister. I'm Cynthia Bishop. No, John, things are getting real simple. John, we have nothing to talk about. I know. Will you please leave now? If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure. No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all. Who? Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime. How about straightening up the living room? Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called. That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister. Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out. Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be? Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you. It won't. I trust him. No. Hung up. She's a grown-up, she can handle it. Why not? Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything. I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it. Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them. Right. "The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off. I like the way he dresses. Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted? What's so stupid about it? Look, I'll call you, okay? I don't think my sister would agree. I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day. Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her? Hello. Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here. Right now. I want to see you. Yeah, I know what you mean. How about inviting me over to dinner? Not today. I've got other plans. Hello. John? You are scum. I'll be there. Hello. Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time. I'm intrigued. You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours? Afraid of getting caught? Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then. I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney. I did. I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous. Why? Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right? Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying? I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals. Eddie... go home. Get some sleep. Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world... Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and -- Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober. You don't drink "booze". Right. I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require. A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce. Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour... I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report. I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder. So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man. "...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"? "Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."? I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd. I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here. Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP? Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors. Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun. You're doing a murder case? No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone. It's okay. It was always like that. But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer. You getting this? So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer? My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric. You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?You mustn't talk to Art. You mustn't tell Art that I was at the trial. Do you hear me? Look. Mister -- -- Why don't you ask Chuckie? That's right. I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay? -- What trial? What do you want?Not the whole time, of course. I -- I didn't take my eyes off it! I can see the hammer still, it was cocked... It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders... I can describe it.Hello, Brigman. No, Bud, no... not you. I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay? Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh? Hey... big boys don't cry, remember? Tell me later. It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me. I drown, you tow me back to the rig-- Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan... NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're-- No way! Forget it. Not an option. What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on. Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit. Aaargh!! I'm freezing! We've only got one suit. How? Calm down, Bud. I don't know, look around. You see where it's coming in? They'll come out after us. Well, that's that. Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this-- You noticed. Yeah. So sue me. Not in this thing. You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed. You owe me one, Virgil. Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing. Now what? They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under intelligent control. It's trying to communicate. He's got the shakes? You dumb jarhead motherf-- Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will. We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that. It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me... please. I don't think they mean us harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling. Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things. I touched one of them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech? I saw something! I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry. Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical! Bud, something really important is happening here. I'm telling you what is there. You're just not hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan. There's something down there. Something not... us. Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here. You can see how it's kind of zigging around. Yeah? Well I'm not. I can extend that. There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside to tie onto them. Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using. Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker. I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down. Cute, Virgil. I don't know. I DON'T KNOW! But what did he see that made him panic? Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him-- No. I don't know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It's a Russian submersible. No problem. No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it. You're right, Bud. It was just that simple. Aren't you clever? You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms. Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more. No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks. Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael. I haven't worn mine in months. What are you still wearing that for? I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project. That must be it. Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons. You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What would have you done? Look, I didn't come down here to fight. Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed? Not for long. Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You-- You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap-- My rig. I designed the damn thing. We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake. I can't believe you let them grab my rig! I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud? I can't believe you let them do this! We should be dead. We didn't decompress. I think they're from 'you know'. Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure. No light. Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non- human, but intelligent... You better not say you missed that. Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out. Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better. You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet? You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig! With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me? Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust me... they're not speaking Russian. That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they? How many are there? Copy that. Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right? Neutron counter's not showing very much. The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are you sure you got the depth right on this? Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs? Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS... Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later. Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it? What kind of luminous things, Bud? Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing? He couldn't be that dumb. The guy's a trained killer. Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty. Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move... No. Just you and me. We get some proof, then tell them. Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little. Let's go for it. We could get lucky. Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right? A non-terrestrial intelligence. Figured that out for yourself, did you? Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight. What's you depth, Cab Three? Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach. Would we see the flash? What kind of light? I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone... Bud, it's the pressure. Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice. Ensign Monk want to know how you feel. 8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay? Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning. Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker. If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you? I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask? That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead. What is that? I loathe bats. How'd you find this place? It doesn't protect your head, though. What is this stuff? Kevlar? Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that? ... How long have I been out? ... Where are you taking me? How do I know you won't keep them all? Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures. I won't let you have it. I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. Well -- I think you might consider ... A hundred and eight? Can't we -- What about the girl? Shouldn't we -- Look! Police! WHICH CAR? I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to... I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple. I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you. What now? How can you do that if she's already off the line? I'm sorry, she hung up. What are -- ... Where are you calling from? "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up." Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself. You're one man. You can't save everybody. I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne. So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- ! ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it... I wish you'd... Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible. Yes, Bruce -- I'm here -- All street mimes should be executed. Mm-hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner. To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting. Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me. ... We could try that. God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment. But it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even -- I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all. Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others. ... Terror. Well. A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio. Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away. Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess. That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat? Do you sail? As far as I know. I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!! You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her! ... Why the mask? I've seen worse. Much worse. Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. And you want a -- ... Thank you. God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever... You okay? LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!! Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him! Yeah. Deja vu. It's gone. Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep. He's not crazy. Allie, he's not. I've had it with you. I'm leaving. Alexander... I know you. He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know. Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this. Are they paying you for all this? You are on drugs. Oh, Bruce... His face. Allie, look at his face. Plain or roasted? Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research. Peanuts? Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne? Yum, yum. Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. Rich. Reclusive. Bankrolls half a dozen charities. All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas. Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting. No. Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet? Evildoers, huh? Big or small? A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City? Burned out. I need a vacation. How'd you know it was me?Chet, you don't have to hurt him. Knox?! Chet... Don't stop. You know, Oh Chet, that feels fabulous, Nice meeting you, Knox. Bye, Gin. It's all right, Chet. I have to go home. Chet might call. What is that? Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it- God, if Chet found out he'd... Uh-huh. Knox, you are so infuriating! Chet? To a play? Are you kidding? Look, I've got to go. I'm gonna be late for the play. And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you? Just like that?! You just knew? You say that over and over but you don't even know me! Well, you did! Chet found out and he's nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox. Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me? Knox, why are you doing this to me? Knox, I don't believe this! Knox, you're crazy. If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that? Knox! what are you doing here? Huh? I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home. Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her. Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody? Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like. Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called. Hello? You going out for the Henley Hall play? They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream." That's your sister school, right? Ridgeway High. How's Henley Hall, Gin? Pleased to meet you.I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause. Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way. Did you ask Sal? And? So? What did he do this time? That's not even true. I just want a slice. I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man. ...peanuts. Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips... Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman. You gotta lotta nerve. Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do. Come off it. You are too crude. I didn't stutter. You heard me. He's completely innocent. He's just being nice. What are you so worked up about? Stop tripping. See ya around. I'll see ya there. No. I'm going with you. Hurry up and get dressed. I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities. I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all. I'm carrying you as it is. I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work. Sal's gonna be mad. Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches? How come you're not at Sal's? I'm in here. Do me a favor. Go to work. Good! Leave me alone when I'm sleeping. I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here. Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late. Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping? Whew! And move to Long Island... You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right. I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner. How are you holding up in this weather? Sorry, comb got caught. Yeah, me too. This might take some time. I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now. Where's the stuff?We're still standing. I didn't. Yes indeed. You almost got yourself killed last night. Good morning. You're welcome. Maybe you shouldn't. Don't get happy. This changes nothing between you and me. You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it. That was a foolish act, but it was brave. That chile owes you his life. Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know. Hold your tongue. You don't have that much love. You're a drunk fool. The evil eye doesn't work on me. And move to Long Island. Number Two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a Black business empire. Needless to say what happened, this house is it, all I got. I'm too through with yar people. Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house. Every year I keep threatening to sell it. I'm not studying no Mayor. Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples. My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul. Don't like 'em. A fan will do. I'll do. Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an old woman. That's why I don't fool with it. Only let you touch it...Ouch! Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed? I got nowhere to go. We haven't had a good sit-down for a long while. Jade, you're late.You're to the curb. You better step off. Get a life. Act like one then. Be a man. Be a man. You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son. Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something. You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week. Where are you going? Feels good. What? Later for you. It's cold. Of course I'm sweating. I'm burning up. It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here. I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight. Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love. Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son? What else? You a blue-moon fool. That's out. No! It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when? How long then? No! No! You won't come back either. And I really wanted some ice cream too. Your memory is really getting bad. Where's the ice cream? The H�agen- Dazs butter pecan? How else was I going to get you here? I haven't seen you in a week. Come in then. What took you so long? Is it hot? Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me? When? I want you to spend some time with me. I want you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I'd rather not be bothered. I work too, but I still make time.I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit. Shit, thank God. You look like a creep. Will I see you again? Funny hours. How come? Whatcha doin' over there?All right. All right. Just call me a cab. No, no. You boys are tired. A few empty tables. It's cozier. Besides, Mel Torme couldn't fill this place on a Wednesday night. Thrilling. Both of you. Spur of the moment. Yes. I supposed you still have that old phone booth. You miss him, don't you? Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in. He mentioned you had a girl for a while. A singer. Is that the way it is? And you don't? It went well tonight. I'm tired. Really. I should get home. Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?Oh, look at you two. So skinny. And those tiny suits ... Oh no! I thought these were lost. Where did you find ... Oh my God ... Catholics. What do you expect? Oh, well, what's in a name, right? Let's go inside and have a look at that cake. Yes, yes. It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association. I thought maybe held gotten over that. A little stiffer, but just as sturdy. Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys! Yes. Right. Eddie. How is he? How's that dog of yours? What was his name? None? Big piece or little? Oh, fine. So. How are you? John. It's good to see you.That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman. There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack? Merry Christmas, Jack. Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here? Jack. From Hurley's? Not so good. How'd the show go? I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth. What's a prom? Why not? Wow. Looks old. I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this? I guess it's getting serious. I saw his stuff in the bathroom. Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can. What are they? Is that what you used to do? Married. Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. And breakfast. Guess they're up. Did you break a cup, Jack?And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore! I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay? That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick. I can't sing it anymore. Huh? Forget it. Some discussion. Decency? Hey listen, pal ... Uh ... Huh? Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank! What's with you guys? Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them. Huh? What's with you two? Oh yeah? I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank. They must've bought the same map we did. Wow. You ever see her again? What'd she sing? Peggy Lee? You're kidding me. Great? Hey, we're connected. Smells like tuna number two to me. Smells like fish. I don't believe it. Okay.The Fantasy Inn. He's right. Virgins? Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars? You play all these places? Maybe we should just listen to the radio. Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank? So find a dime. Let's get out of here. Maybe it's legit. Hey. We take the Avedon, right? Simple. The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd. I was gonna split it with you guys. Hey! For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you? I said I was sorry. Switch? What fucking switch? Piece of cake. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ... You're a prince. Oh, thanks. Well, they're aspiring to be sevens. They're tight. Shoes? Zip me up? What do you think? Nine! Nine. Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go. Save it for your wife. I wear a seven. A seven. If you ask me, this is pretty stupid. Time for what? Hey! Am I missing something? What's wrong with it? Do I look like I'm naked? What's he talking about? Changed? And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster? Where's my name? So work with me, not against me. Okay? What I mean is -- I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right? The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... ... music. You know what I'm saying? What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden? Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business. When? So? I sing now? Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner and dance. Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over. Like a song. Yeah. Sneak out in the morning. Before the guy could wake up and ruin it. Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though. Let me get the light. Well, this is some surprise. Hey ... You don't look so good, pal. Jack. Tell egghead I said hi. If you see him. Listen... you want to get a drink? I got a new place. Or we could go to a bar ... Well, maybe not a bar. But I know a place uptown, if you want -- Oh. Carrots. And peas. None of the important ones. Huh? Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week. Yeah. Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two. So ... ? Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh? You can always get another girl. Shit. I think I started a fire. Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes! Yeah... No. Oh. Hi. Sorry. Frank said --- Oh. Wow. But I still don't see how ... So, what happened? You're kidding. Nervous? You sending me home? Oh. So what's it doing here? The both of them? In there? No kidding? Huh? Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean. Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe. The older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. But the younger ones ... Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart. There are killers with palms like a baby. Soap convention. You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt. Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it. Sure. Ed? How many people live here? Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her. Who's Nina? Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit! You were good. You were good. What's that supposed to mean? All I said was you were good. You're upset. What'd I say? What's the matter? Better than that. How do you do it? Every night? Guess I got a little scattered. It wasn't business. It was pleasure. Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in. If you want, I got a pack in the room. In and out. How's egghead? It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean. Can't sleep? Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell. So why's he do it? Aren't the kids asleep? He do that every year? Nothing personal -- I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all. Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp. No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back. You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes. Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir. Paris Opals. Twelve-and-a-half cents. I sat down with a pencil and added it one day. But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul. Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that? Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again? Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame. Shit. I don't know. It's hard figuring you two as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere. Where's egghead? Oh. Well, for Blackie then. The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night? Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway. Not for money. With my mother. Hey, he's not sore, is he?I'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting here, I just had to come over. Florence Simmons. Susie. Susie Diamond. What's that mean? Thirty-eight. You find a girl? So run a little longer. So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here? I don't believe it. I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late. How should I take it? Just like that, huh? You're not even gonna give me a chance? This is show business? My watch is broken, too. What about me? What do you mean? This where the auditions are? Right. In there. They never do, Mr. Barker. You should've brought a leash, Mr. Barker. The doctor doesn't like to be bitten. Right. Bring him back. Barker. Jock Barker? You know, I'm feeling a lot of hostility from you. So. I'm here, you're here, the piano's here. What d'ya say?I don't care about being hip anymore. But she might be in trouble... Have you seen Tamara? Jason...Voorhees? What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that... I think I'll pass. See you later, okay? Yeah. What are you going to do? I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice. I guess not. It's not that, it's just that... It I get caught, I'll lose my science scholarship and everything. No thanks. Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool... My parents are open minded about that sort of thing. What are you going to do? He bought you that? Really?I don't think that's such a safe idea There must be a phone around here somewhere. Nothing! I went to her cabin and... What are you talking about? He's doing the best he can, Charles. Did you find Rennie? But that doesn't prove that he's the one! What are you doing?? Oh dear God... Where is she? She's fine, Charles. Take it easy... No, I think it's just the beginning. And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live. And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do. Charles, there's someone else coming along too. Don't be. They probably decided to explore each other rather than New York. Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in? Only one young boy ever drowned in that lake, and that was before you were even born. His name was Jason Voorhees. Did you have an accident in the lake? After your parents passed away? When did this start? Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you? I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me. I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since. I gathered that. I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone. In other words, level with me. So, are you having fun yet? No, but I'm sure Toby's fine. The ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there? Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room Rennie, you're the best student I ever had...you have a real gift. If anybody can make use of that pen, it's you. Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school. Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody. Did you know that I'm giving up teaching? Everything okay? You let me worry about him, okay? Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision. I'm glad you decided to come after all.You pushed me... I...I can't... I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles. But what about the drowning boy I've been seeing? Can't we at least talk about it? But Sean said... I'm staying. I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it? She didn't push me into coming. I'm staying. No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out. About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school. Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him. It's not that simple. I can't swim. There's something I haven't told you... Yeah...a lot. Have you seen my dog anywhere? I don't know what to say... That's wonderful, Miss Van Deusen...what's it about? Really? Just felt a little chill. What about not-so-great writers? Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be. Please, hurry... Drugs... Then Jason came. He's here, Sean. I'm not!! I'm not going near any lifeboat! Is the ship going to sink?? The window... Just radio for help, okay??? Where are they? What do you mean??? What about you? Can he really take us home? I want to go home. I want off this ship. I'd love to. But I didn't get you one... We changed our minds. Hi, Sean.But...wait a minute! Time to check out the waiters. That was truly excellent. Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter. Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water... Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice. A real space cadet. I wonder if she'll narc on us... Do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now? Come on, it's grad night. You've got your whole life to be uptight. You're talking to the prom queen, Eva. Do you really think I'm going to risk getting caught? What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot. You're joking, right? I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl. My stepmom couldn't care less, but Daddy would have a shit fit. He might even pay some attention to me. He's undefeated, you know that? Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is. Improvise, of course. A major prick. More or less. It's part of my college fund. It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best. I'm sure we'll have no problem getting them to party with us...especially with this. I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties. But I haven't even shown you my biology project... I packed it. Just for us. They're out of town. Nothing. Perfectly.I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes? Turn that back on! How was the funeral? You two.... Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender? You two.... Any contestants worth mentioning? Hey kid, isn't the prom coming up?It's not my style, okay? Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked. Shoot. That's bullshit. Just shoot. Don't get cocky, girl. Don't say that. I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month. Betty Finn. Gosh..... You don't deserve my fucking speech! I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice.... Hey really, I don't feel so great. Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs? Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything. Gee, thanks. No, not at all. BRAD You're pretty enough to be one. I'm sorry? I don't get it. I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her! What are you smiling at? Oh, I have to hear this. You're beautiful. Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep. Because you're an idiot. I don't know, it was okay, I guess. All right. Because you're an idiot. I don't know, it was okay, I guess. All right. Things are going to change, Earl. I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you? Something like that. Will you do it? What are you doing here?! Heather? Wha... We both said a lot of things we didn't mean, last night. Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up. You goddamn bitch! Heather, I feel awful, like I'm going to throw up. Can we jam, please? Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant? Never say never. Geez, don't listen to them. We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest. I'm sorry? What are you oozing about? Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness. Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims. Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna? I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people? I was talking with someone! Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last...... Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question? I'll think about it. Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock. Heather, my love, there's a new sheriff in town. Yeah, I just got back. Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch? No. Don't talk to me like that. People love you but I know you. Jennifer Forbes told me the petition she signed was to put a jacuzzi in the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton... Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on. You're not funny. Ouch! I said I was sorry. Is she dead? Heather. Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.? Well, you better move Holden out of the way or he's going to get spewed. Maybe you should see a doctor. Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus... Sure. Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host. If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you? You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of. What were you trying to do? Sleep? So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight? Hea ther , I've got something going with J.D. Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why? Uh-huh. Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food. Give it up girl! Give me the clipboard. Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent. What's your damage, Heather? You ruined my... I thought I...you.. You know what I want, babe? The bomb, asshole! How do you turn the fucker off? It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it. Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head. Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground. No-o! Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me. Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note. I think I know Heather a bit better than you, okay? If she was going to slash her wrists, the knife would be absolutely spotless. This knife is filthy. You're still not listening! I'm not.. Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side.... Get off my bed, you sick psycho! You think you're a rebel! You're not a rebel! You're a sick psycho! Do you think you're a rebel? Do you think you're a rebel? I wanna know! It's over, J.D. Over! I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide. I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline thing work. Lines of communication between the cliques. You were a phase.... You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you. We're breaking up. I am out! May be . Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for... You can be so immature! Don't even talk about that stuff! You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience. Can't you see this is a special moment? Your son's dead and you love him. Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral? Did not. Did not. I did not want them dead . We killed them, didn't we? Kurt doesn't look too good. Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on.... Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go? Oh come on . Lots of people drink Perrier. It's come a long way. You must have had fun. Oh. Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K. We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it was World War Two, not a school play. Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole. First tell me this similarity is not incredible. So it looks like the person's been shot and killed when they're really just unconscious and bleeding. French. You can't be serious? Hey listen, my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over. I don't get the point of me writing a suicide note when we'll just be shooting them with blanks. So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus! I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off. My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano. Yeah. Scary stuff. Next channel, darling. That's good. Have you done this before? You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too." She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right? That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad." "You might think what I've done is shocking..." I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own. Like a suicide thing? It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano. Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford. Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna... No shit, sherlock. I can't believe it. I just killed my best friend. You're not funny. No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely. Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something. What are you doing ? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that. O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon? Don't be a dick. That stuff'll kill her. Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover. But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out. I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die. There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm. Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky. Well then, I'll pray for rain. Killing her won't solve anything. Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss to wear and how to hit three keggers before curfew. Some genius. You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set. S'okay.... It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit. It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends. Sure, I'm on my way to a party at Remington University. Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place. I don't know. Should you? I didn't. Cherry. Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe. No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well. How very. If you inherit five million dollars the same day aliens tell the earth they're blowing us up in two days, what would you do? All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized. Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern. This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life. Superb. Greate pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the funeral tomorrow. May be . Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight. May be . There's kind of a dark horse now in the running. I guess. Get a job. Where is he? Where's J.D.? But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right. Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness. It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up. The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness. I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering. But my name's not... That's three things.Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home. About what? Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed. Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor. Uh huh. Can I tell you tomorrow? I think I... Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night. Not me, I fell for it right down the line. Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales. He married me because I was pretty. It's nice that you can make that choice. You must value your independence. Do you have a family? I bet. Going into people's homes. I apologize for that scene with my husband. You must have overheard. Oh, that's fine. So, you're just kind of a roving -- Everything breaks at once. Do you do washing machines, too? Oh, great. Well, can I make an appointment? Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators? It's okay, baby, the police are coming. Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage. Well, of course I know you can. No, Rita, I -- what was that? -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line. Holly -- that's not so. Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do. Well, that's what happens with grownups, too. You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him? Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart. A man? Was it a dream? It's the middle of the night, sweetie. Aw, okay. Baby, what is it? Hey. Have a nice time -- it's a good school. '"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- ' "Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!" Rita, he's only twelve years old, I've tried to get him to agree to one. I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately. The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything. He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss. I've asked him what's wrong. No, I told you. A whiff of perfume on his shirt. Yeah. There's still a lot I want to do. It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here. Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today. Do you want me to come up and tuck you in? Honey, do you want some hot chocolate? Honey -- Neil -- what -- He's staying with a friend. Hurry up now, you'll be late for school. Neil, you could have burned the house down! The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay? I think we got it just in time before the ink dried. He doesn't have a temperature. No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning? Here, take this out to the table. Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that? C'mon, kids, let's go. We'll talk in the morning. Oh God. No, Philip, I don't want you coming back here. And if you want to talk to me -- call . That's not a decision for you to make on your own. There's always an excuse, isn't there? Philip, what are you doing here? I'm having the floor fixed, You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought. "Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going." Boy, you really buckle under a little pressure, don't you? That's not the case. Honey, it's not the end of the world. You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up. And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own. You are free now, you are independent. Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags! Oh, honey. What? Honey? How did it go? You didn't call me. I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this. Oh baby. Philip! The senior partner? Did she water this plant? It looks a little bent out of shape. Yeah -- she did a good job. This glass looks brand-new. Did you lock the garage door? Where should I hide the car keys? I thought we'd be happy here. Fuck you, Philip. There are people who do things because they want to get caught. Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria Valentino "? I don't care, Philip. You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead. Just watch out for those buck teeth. Well, what about these ? Do you usually put your carbons in your pocket, too?! I remember what day you wore that jacket. It was Monday . The day you were all day in meetings again? And had to send out for sandwiches ? No, I'm not kidding you, Philip . Someone nice will find him if he gets lost. I know someone else who's sensitive. Neil's still having a bad time at school. I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time. How long does it have to be a new house? I hear things in this house, There's no card or anything. Do you remember who gave us this? Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job? How was your lunch with Charlie? How was lunch? It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics. Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine. Don't get in an uproar. Honey, are you okay? What? What? Now , Neil. Stop teasing your sister. Paul Newman in "The Hustler." We're going to think about it. What if someone else buys it in the meantime? And it's a shorter commute. You could have a pool to cool off in. They don't expect to get what they're asking. Let's make an offer. But it's what we want. I know it's at the high end of our range -- This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us. You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house, I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking. Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool. Two -- three if you count the husband. Oh, space! -- You said the right thing. This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling. Just reduced. Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings. It's been on the market a while, hasn't it?Wife, girlfriend or mother? Any particular brand? Are you being helped, sir?It hit me! Where are they?! We made it! Can't we fix it? How much time does that give us? Seeing how my stock's doing... Maybe they already have. They know, don't they? The escape bubbles? What can we do? Maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir. Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it. How did you know they'd get into the vodka? Has it helped? I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps... Why are you here? Good...It's going good. Why? You going to give me hard time like the others? After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it. Sixpack? You screw around like that again and-- Roger... More light, Sixpack... Still...you did the right thing. Today...with DeJesus. That was smart thinking to get him inside... You did good... Timex... You take your money, too seriously, Bo. I signed-up for the stock option. How's TransOcean doing? Made your million, yet? I'm not touching you! It saw us! Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson? Are you okay, Jonesy? Well, why haven't they answered our flares? Are you sure you saw something? Don't spend all day down there. The shack... What is it? What is it? Cobb's cut...It was in him! It got Doc... It needs blood? What's wrong? What on earth's the matter with you? How is he? Who were you talking to? No...he's really sick. I heard him last night. The company will take that into consideration... What is it? Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson? Clear for pickup. Hardly. Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?... Right. Your pocket?The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy. No, you're not a guy. Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart. What does it say? Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something. You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement. Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'. Did you sleep with her? See you. Bye. Bye Diane. Yes. You are such a great person Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person. Okay, I got it. That's just so embarrassing. C'mon Lloyd. Lloyd. Lloyd, give it up. Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques. Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain. Then what's love? Going out as friends. That's not even a scam. But you never had a first date. That's unlikely. "Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this, have you? What? I'm sorry, talk. And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever... You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe... Look at his face, he did the deed. He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak. Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd. Lloyd is doomed. I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt. Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is. Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word. Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll." Y'know, it's all so phoney. I don't feel anything. If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd? It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd. Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it. I wrote sixty-three songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.No, no he's not. How can you, how can you say that? You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this. What's the profile? Pardon me? I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me. But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me? Be a little decent. I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye. Hello. You're right. I'm so ashamed dad. No, I will. I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar, and a thief. No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you. I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you. You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you... No, but you stole from them. Yes, I... You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel? What am I supposed to think? But I found the money. Swear to god. Swear to god, I need to know the truth. Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money? Dad, are you okay in there? If I pick it up, we'll only get back together. Dad, I love him. Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him. Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well-covered territory. Unbelievable. This is a nightmare. I like him a lot. Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning? You're not listening to me. It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet. But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year. Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you. Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him. Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now. I know that. I'm fine. Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time. I was irresponsible, I should have called. Dad, I'm sorry. Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream. Okay, I give up. And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around. I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous. Dad. Goodnight. Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that? Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight. Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous. God, I'll have to go on a plane. I won? Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding! Tell me, is it bad news? What? I love you dad. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Everybody thinks I'm a priss. I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it. Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean... God, that's... this is ridiculous. What are you doing? Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend. Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world. But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared. Alright, no more, I'm going to save it. I didn't think anyone would get it. You like it? Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back. Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out. You will? If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him? I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad. This is me telling you about me. Mom, please? I know. Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they? Not right now, thanks. Okay. Good to know. Okay. Okay. I'm fine. I love you. Please, I love you. I love you. How many more times do I have to say it? I love you. Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die. My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you. I'm sorry. Oh shit. Don't be mean, this is hard for me too. Lloyd, I love you, okay? You have Corey and DC. I have my dad. Just my dad. No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine. Why, did you tell Corey what happened? No. No I didn't. Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share. No, I don't, I don't. I think that we should stop going out on dates. No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word... No, no. We decided... Yeah, uh-huh. We'll see. Yeah. Well, I need to study, and... I think that we should spend some time apart. How can I look at you and say this? I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level. I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that... No, we don't have to say it. It was wonderful. Uh-huh. It was wonderful. Your letter came yesterday. Here are some blankets. This is a good song, this is a really good song. Then why are you shaking? You're cold. You're shaking. Yes. Are you shaking? Yeah. This is so noble. Yeah. Oh. I was putting the... Am I wrecking my car? Right. Yeah? I'm doing alright. Yeah. Friends with potential. Be friends? I just can't have any social life right now. I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean? Well... just meet her. Yes. She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you. You have to meet Bess. Okay, bye. Stop by later. I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours. Come on. I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you? I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by. I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't. You think so? Yeah? Yeah, I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up. Or, or I could always wear this one. Then call me later. Then call me tomorrow. I only have something like sixteen weeks. No, I'm serious. So what's your job this summer? You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you. You know what? Thanks. But either way it still feels... Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know? Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it. Yeah. I'm so glad we did this. Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me. Nobody knew me before tonight. Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"... Bye. Thank-you. He does this every year? Yeah. So it's an honor? Keymaster? Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early? What are these? Would you hold this for me? Goodbye. Eight. I'll go. I'll go. Well... Actually, I think that I... Hmmm.... Well, not monumentally. Saturday, I have some things to do around the house. Yeah, I have to help my father. Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks. Oh, thanks, but I'm busy. No, I read it on the message. Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square. Yeah. Yeah. What a day. Thank you very much. Yeah? Hi. You called me? Thank-you. The real world.Hang tough, Lloyd. Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you. We'll just make an appointment for you at Seattle Junior College. Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you. That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing. You have to decide on a career. Lloyd. You missed every one of your career counselling sessions. Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now. Lloyd. Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
