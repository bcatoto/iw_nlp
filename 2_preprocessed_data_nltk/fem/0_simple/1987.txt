Well we can't just stay here -- Maybe we should just leave -- Don't you care? That's probably her now. Or the police. She'll tell them everything... I said no. I don't. Yes. They'll never find us. And the blood let you out? So you were cheated. You're still afraid. Who did? And you came back here to solve the puzzle -- Hell... What kind of doors? Let me see. A box? You promised me an explanation. Tell me, damn you. I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you. Later. Well? You're hurting. Keep your voice down. Who? Good. Hurting. What do you want me to do. Ssh! Back from where? What happened to you? No. God no. Tell me who you are. Who are you? Oh my God. I'm very happy. What about Larry -- But you said -- Well? I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome. Oh. Oh yes. Oh. That's right. Who are you? No, damn you -- I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see? This afternoon. You look terrible. Have you had an accident? Of course. There's no need to shout. What's the problem? Kirsty? It's very late. The keys are in the kitchen. Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches. Just to your left. There's a towel in the bathroom. Kirsty. Dead. It's better you see for yourself -- I don't know where to begin... Please. I can't bear it... Please... Don't go upstairs. Larry... -- I'll go see. Fine. I've seen worse. Who was it? Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe? I'll be down in a minute Maybe a brandy. I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while. Just feeling a bit sick. I'm here. Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed. Larry.... No you won't. You're done worse. Take it slowly. No, you're not. It's probably going to need stitches. Let me see. You're NOT going to faint. Is it deep? What have you done? It looks like a bomb's dropped. Why not? He's here? In here. Larry! No argument. All right. No. I'm not. You mean we're moving in? I thought half of it was your brother's? Not exactly modern. Why didn't he want to sell it? How long since you were here? It smells damp. Just a thought -- Maybe somebody changed the lock. We're going to freeze to death. What's wrong? Am I? Maybe I will. Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm. That's right. I prefer the floor. We don't need a bed, do we? No. That's right. Let's keep it that way, shall we? Do you care ? No. No. Let's go upstairs. I... suppose so, yes. You want something to drink? There's a first time for everything. That depends. Please. Just soda. Not much. What?Sure. Where's my father? What's happening? Not much. Hi. You can keep them. Stay the fuck away from me. No. That wasn't the deal. I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me. HE did. I've seen him. To a man called Frank Cotton? You did this before, right? Let me alone, will you? No! This isn't for real. Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from. Who are you? It's just a puzzle box. Oh Christ. I don't remember. Please listen to me -- It's important. I have to speak to my father. Frank -- Bastard. You bastard -- Oh my God. This isn't happening. You want it? No. This isn't happening. Don't touch me. Or so help me -- No. No. Julia! Oh my God. I saw everything. I was here this afternoon. I have to see my father. Where's Daddy? Sure. What happened? Which is where? Hi. I got soaked. Steve. You wouldn't believe me. I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in? My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him. Who brought me in here? Wait a moment -- What happened to me? I have to get out. It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over -- PLEASE. You're in danger. Get the fuck out of here. Yes! I want to see. I don't believe it. Gone? Finished? No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's -- I have to talk to you. Sure. What? Really? She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her. Maybe you should give it some time. I love you too. Yeah. I just wanted to be sure you were O.K. I've forgotten. Sure. O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee. Surprise. Is Julia here? Me like. Big house. I will. See you. Take care, Dad. Of course. Every day. I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.? It's not a gesture. I want to do this on my own. Come on, trust me a little will you? Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job. Great. I'm not going to change my mind, Dad. YOU'D like my room. No Dad. I said: I found a room. I found a room. I got through. Daddy? 'Bye. Sure. Why not? Will you GO, damn you? Just go. PLEASE. I'll be O.K. I'm going to go see Dad. He'll look after me -- Don't let them take me, Steve -- These THINGS... they want to take me -- Steve. Thank God you came. As long as you don't mind the smell of fur -- Just trying to get my apartment in order. No, it's good to see you. If I make it through the day. I've been better. Oh! It's not what I heard. Oh no? There ya go. I beg your pardon? Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid. She's so damn... English. Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia. What do we do if there isn't? All right. No. That's nice. Not that late. You know I do know the way home. I'm coming! Sleep well. I'm here. I AM house-trained. Just upstairs. I won't be able to stand. That's right. Cointreau.Thank you Billy, from the baby and me. You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays? That's not the point. Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic. I'm starting my own collection. They've got the real thing outside. Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow. The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us. You're the biggest fibber. He's the worst liar. You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you! You do, you do. You're just not saying. Where? What is it? Air-raid? Don't be so cheeky, Bruce. They might be. A bit too quick. Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt. It looks a bit fishy to me. It's not. It's happening to me. Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that. He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break. He's being posted. I was terrible to him. Who said anything about love? I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him. No, I won't. Out. It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up. That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there. Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me. Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here? What would we do if a German came into the house? He always knows. After this dance. You know it? It must be an old one. This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer. I've had a letter from her. They've moved house. When do you think you'll get leave again? What are you going to be then? Why didn't they say that before you started? You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission? You taste it. It looks....foreign. How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country. We don't know anything about it And what's that? I wish you could have told me yourself. Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas. You joined up. Has Sue got it right? And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card. They'd gone. No Turks. Now take deep breaths, and push. Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think? I don't believe this is happening to me. I think it's very sensible in the circumstances. What did he say? Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride. What is it, pet? You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life. There, there, my baby. You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick. And where do you think you're going? I won't have this vulgar talk in my house. The ideas you get in your head. Don't be silly, Dawn. Half the time he's bluffing. Ancient. Have you finished your homework? Just ignore her, Mac. I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning. Wasn't it lovely? Up to six weeks, I think. No, Mother! It's War! War! I wish it could all have been different. Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you? We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac. This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back. He could always make me laugh. You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did. Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back. Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with? Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together. That's right. Not since then Not since I got married. Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since... It seems to have survived. Please yourself. Let them go, if they want. I can't do it. What's the point? It was the best time of his life. And now we're glad you did. How long? What did I do to deserve this? Father, that's enough now I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again. You've been drinking. Your tipsy. You're having me on, Molly. Molly! You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really. I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor. I know you mean well. It's so far way. I couldn't bear it. My aunt in Australia has offered..Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here. Let us get to the border! Nice? I didn't do anything. I'm...scared. Can you fly this? I insist. Dieter? Oh, I can't. What is your name? I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it. What part what? It'll remind me of you. Aren't we all. What a nerve! ya hyutn slulptsa? In him? What happened? He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt! He's not an ordinary man. It's just money. Yes. Joe. I have a new client. We met on the beach. I know a nice island. He should do it in person ...I mean ex person. He wants to apologise. What is it? I told you, I work for him. That's twenty feet high. If he was able, what would he say. But you did it. It was you. It was you. You are, I've seen you. Do something! Now what? Doesn't matter. I'm on your side. Kiss her you fool. You're gonna laugh. Aren't you a little optimistic? Just like that? Why not, what are you going to do? I love you too. I've never met anyone like you. How? I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours. For you. Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along. It was my choice. Can't you do something? What? You can say that again. What do we do? What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him. They'll listen to what we say in here. That I really don't know. They asked about you. Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here. What'd...you forget? What happened? Can you? He's Dutch. You can't even speak Dutch. This going to work? I know the territory. That's not this direction. It's back the other way. Chiang Cho? What? He's a client of mine! What's the matter. You can't suspect Dieter. He's a famous photographer. He makes millions. I asked him. Dieter's gone to shoot a still job. Hong Kong. Hong Kong. Where what? Too late, they won't come back out till morning. That must be him. Water taxi. How? Now what? What? Then where's the chip. This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea. Where we going? It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things. Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party. Ryuji and Gruner. They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something. Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious. Oh sure. Hiroshima. I don't know. He mentioned a city. How do you know you can trust me? One chip? What'd he steal? He must be a good friend. What's he done? Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him? Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER? This business is over. I'm leaving too. You're leaving. I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it. You did. No. No, he didn't do that. Last night? Sometimes. I told you I did. I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans. There's not much to tell. They kidded me a little. What do you mean? You seemed interesting. Wanted to get to know you. They left. I had to go with them. Joe! What happened to you? That depends... He likes the quiet. They were here last week. To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details. No. Ryuji just hires us. Trans Ocean Travel. Who do you work for? ...Ummm, you really work for the foreign service? You're doing...Okay. You're talking to me. You did. Why do you do it? You talk to yourself. That you're not crazy. Are you alright? Can I help? As if your mind's not all there. ...and sort of...disinterest. I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction.. ...I...don't know. I waited for you. You again. I just work for the travel firm. You mean from it. ...Rene. Like there's someone else here. Nothing...Al. Why do you talk that way? Without what? Do what? Haven't seen you around. And you. Oh...I can't. Business. Where? Blake said that? Yes? Blake? I am confused. Or maybe it's you. Is someone else here? What do you do about what?I didn't say anything. You did. JOE No I didn't. You said something first. I said...I didn't say..anything! Nothing. Nothing. What's what?Occasionally. It's terrific Win. It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win. You didn't like him? They've got two monsters now. Both boys. Hello, Win. Say goodbye, Mike. You have a weakness for Lady Cops. I'll miss you, Mike. I think it's probably still a good idea. I don't know... So. Everyone's all right...? Mike...? ... Mike. I'll have to pack a lot of clothes. "To"... Forget about you. Long enough. ... Don't explain. I know. I know. Yeah. Let's do it. Do you? What a memory. No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really. Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay? Tomorrow night. Can you come? I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building. Pretty far. I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found. I'm going away after that, the next morning. I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come... Oh, I'm fine. They've replaced you with quite an entourage. It's a regular "marching band". You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady -- Oh God, that's great! Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct. What do you want to do? You told her? Okay, then let's make it easy. It was a mistake. Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it. This is me, Mike. There's nothing else... They called here after you left... More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One month? A couple of days? I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?! Let go! I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park. You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park. And then what? I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country! You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time! You put me life in danger. I can't open it. What do you want? Good night, Mike. It was nice having you "watch over me"... I'll miss you, Mike... He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best. Tell it like it is. You don't like him, do you? But "nice". I saw you with a dog, in my mind. That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...? And "is"...? So it was "love". Okay. Let's just see if a mugger gets me. And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid! That's the dumbest walk I ever saw! You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way? Want to go out for a drink? I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail... So, this could be your last night, huh? You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind. You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir? You were reading my Renoir. Didn't do very well, did you? Urdu and Hindi. Hmm... Right. How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...? He said he'd kill me. I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning. Identify him. If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail. Listen, that was my fault. Yeah. Hi. Just checking to see if you're here. I think I can probably do that on my own. I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee. Let's get a drink. People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal. You can touch me, I won't bite. Put it on my account, please. Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie. Would you pick one out, please? Are you nervous? I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary. My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School. You live in Manhattan? What did he say? Do you have another tie? Something more conservative? There's a phone in the car. Can we go then? Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true? I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away. I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right? Straight ahead. I've never seen anyone killed before. Just putting in an appearance then. Not if you don't want me to. It was something my father always liked me to do. What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!! And I'm making mine. ... He killed Win... he enjoyed it... ... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial... ... I don't want to talk about it...Tommy...! Absolutely. I don't know Tommy. Sure we are, let's go! Nothing. He doesn't want to sleep here. Neither do I. It's not my house anymore. I'm all right. Was it Venza? Did you get him? He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world, huh? I'm going to visit my sister for a few days. I'd like you to get your stuff out. Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me. What's the difference? I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him... I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift. Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you... I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me. I watched TV. I'm not saying it's your fault. You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this. I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar! Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap. What was that? C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not? I'm sorry. I know I heard noises... the detective's wife... Did you hear what I said? It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case. Mike, take it easy... What? Should I wait up? We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow. Coming to bed? Why? I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you? Excuse me! You went to a party with her? What's wrong with your paisley tie? She took you shopping for a tie? It's not your taste. Where'd you get the tie? Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay? I'd identify him. Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts. She's got to identify him. Honey. You got him. What shit, honey? The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you? Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit. I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful. Let 'em eat their hearts out. It's twenty bucks in the bank. Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think? I can still use a gun. For how long? So how'd it go? Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT. Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me? What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity... I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore. My ass is falling. It is. My ass if falling. Mike? Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes. Too kinky.'Again'? Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago. I told Max eight o'clock. Dad! Don't sneak up on people like that! I can't sleep with the closet door open, either. Not even a crack. Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared. I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the closet monster ! When I dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. I used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then I went ahead and married one... I went Yuppie and you became a hippie... Were still out of synch. A big legal war wasn't going to improve anybody's situation. We've all been through enough. Besides I was raised better than that. Thanks for having us, Dad. Michael!... There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael. Things are going to change around here when school starts. Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him. Wait a minute, kiddo. -- If there's a girl, we could talk about her. Then let's act like friends. Let's talk. I know this is a new place, and -- Does that mean we are, or we aren't? Okay? Grandpa has plans of his own. Michael, I want you to do this. Everybody has been bending over backwards for you. You come home late. You sleep in to the middle of the day -- Sam is always alone. You do exactly what you want... tonight do what I want for a change. Michael, will you do me a favor this evening? Will you stay home with Sam tonight? I'm meeting Max for dinner after work. Michael, are you still in bed? I get off in another twenty minutes. I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together. Oh, no, you won't. Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe. He's just a deep sleeper. For everything. Still mad at me? What happened? Is everybody all right?! Ohmygod... There's nothing wrong with Max. I don't know why you don't -- Not another word! I can't believe you're doing this. I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again. Stop it, Sam. Stop it right now! Not funny, Sam! What did you say? Oh, no. Now what? Nanook, stop breathin' on me. No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers... Ah... I didn't know you were having guests... Okay. Have you been eating pizza? You smell like garlic. In here? Where's Michael? Sam! What happened!? You had me scared to death. Are you all right? What's wrong? Tell me. Sam. Is everything all right? Lights out, Sam. I guess no one cares what I got a job. Soon. You've heard this story before? Not that poor. Tell them to get something to eat. That's the boardwalk, Sam. Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move... but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla... Ocean air! We're getting close... Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!? Max... what are you talking about? I thought you said they needed discipline? No, no. Just worrying about my boys -- as usual. I hope so. He doesn't walk all over me. I don't understand Sam. He's just not like this. I'm really sorry, Max. Max! What's wrong? Boy! Somebody areound here sure has bad breath! You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding. I hear this is the decade for cute. I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children. Work with kids in some way. Teenagers, maybe. And Santa Carla seems to be full of them. You seem like a terrific guy, Max, and I'm grateful for the job... Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago. You're cute, Max. Hi, Thorn. Do I look that needy? I'm not looking for a tape. What I need is -- Lucy.I will, David! Look. Leave him alone. C'mon, Michael. I want to go. Yeah. For a ride. I like Michael. Promise me you'll keep it that way. You're not like the others, Laddie. You're like me. I can still remember, too. You didn't tell David? No, Laddie. It was a memory . Laddie... you can still remember. You can still remember home. Who, Laddie? This is Michael. So do I! They'll be coming for Laddie and me, won't they? Save Laddie first. Take laddie. David's looking for me... I have to go. I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed. It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing... Because I love you... Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael. Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you... I have to talk to you. Can I come up? Tonight. At the boardwalk... Have to sleep. Have to sleep, Michael. No... no, everything's different now... No. They've made me one of them, but I miss my family. I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away. Don't be a baby. That didn't hurt and you know it. Okay. I guess you're new around here. Michael's great. I like Michael. Me, too. What do you mean? Star. If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it. Okay. Talk. Did you want to talk to me? Are you following me?I like it! So, doll, what about you lately? Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing. I'm going to take it. I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor. You won't be able to stay mad at me, right? Yes. You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us? I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that? You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around. Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are... Why not try it for a few weeks? I just found out. You didn't say anything to me? You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow. Please. Bastard, sneak, quitter. Don't say anything about anything. Sit down, stop. You were quick enough to get Tom's help when... How? I think you're the Devil. This isn't friendship. Yeah -- being a basket case. Yes, I guess. Yes. What? This is important to me. I don't know. I may be in love with him. I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him. I have to be somewhere. If all that happened, how come you're so chipper? There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating? Stop kidding. I want to know what happened. What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it... Aaron, will you tell me? Then what was good about it? Do others feel that you did well? Do you feel good about it? Did it really go well? No. How'd it go? You too. Okay, great -- good luck. I'm not sure I'll be able to...I... Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there. As good as humanly possible. It's not a date. It's co-workers going to a professional conclave. I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume... Did you bring your grey suit? Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much? Wow...Okay...See you there... Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting. A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck? Yes. You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking. Sounds like you may be on to something. Well, whatever you think. Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him. Thanks. The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master. Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes. I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you. I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from? I write for you sometimes. To the pan of the supplies boxes -- Of course. Okay. Great line at the end. You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap... Oh good. If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in. Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie? Nine seconds. You want to start going over who they could have gotten? They can't take on people like this for network news. For God's sake. What's going on? Call if you get weird. Good night. This conversation is not worthy of you. Sure. Why do you say that? No. It makes me nervous to think about it. Let's do this. A half hour in the lobby. At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic. No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here. Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness. But thanks. Thanks. I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds. Yes. It's started. What are you dressed up for? Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week. No, I'm not. I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond. Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky. Yes? Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that? Take a breath. Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions. Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it. I'll never tell. Yes, there is. I'll be right down. It's right tight. Bobbie, please. Right there, Bobbie. No stop where he's all besieged. Just a two-second dissolve. Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell. Let me hear it! Play back the last line... Please, Bobbie, we're pushing. Go back to 316, Bobbie. The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...' Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same. I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done. ...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan. I hope you weren't... Fill for a second. No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful. It's not opinion. Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that. I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours. Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot. I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you. Well, why not? Hey, what is this? My life's rushing in front of my eyes. Why did I have to do this to myself? Watch you take off. Call me if you need anything. It's better when you let me say it. It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that... So you have an extra bathing suit, huh? It's okay. You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your... I knew what you meant. I don't wan to discuss work. That's not going to be the way we say good-bye. Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal. You mean something to me. It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that... It just proves that the difference we have are... Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between... It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that. Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and... Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did. I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview. You fucking... That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.' Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal. How can you say that to me? That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint... Whooo. What? No. Did he really? I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say? Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh? Good night. Good night??! Yes. Uh-huh. I don't know if that's absolutely necessary. Hi, again. Sorry about... It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything? I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news. I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's. Hi. It's me. Okay. Sorry. Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me. He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand? What happened? No. I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can. I forgot all about Aaron. I promised to stop by and see how he did. Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else. Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it. Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons. Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease? I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why? This is hysterical. At least kiss me when you do that. Well... Great. Uh-uh. Good. That's it...See you. Who? It moved me. I did relate to it -- I really did. It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff. Okay? So you like me, huh? Oh, good. Uh-huh. Why, you need me for the story? Nooo. Is it your story? Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh. I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me. Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom? Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage. Well, what is it? What? Eventually. Does it have to be right now? Okay. You didn't like the party, huh? I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move... It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you. I'll be the judge of that. Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy. Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude. Well, I'll go in and have a bite. Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on. Okay. Yeah? I'm going over to Aaron's. Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later. How long do you think you'll be there? Yeah. It was an unusual place to be. We're going to George. Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'. Nervous? Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks. Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you. What do you mean clean? Billion. Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club? Give it to him -- so we can concentrate. Yes. I just got back -- I don't know which end is up. How's it going? I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting. 'Really a lot appreciate it...' No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming. You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here? We're working here!! You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh... Hey? Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake? Stop whining and do something about it. I agree with you -- you're not qualified. So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as... 'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.' It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous. So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write. Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college? What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper. I trust you. How are you at back rubs? So great -- right? I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor. Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself. Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking? Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say... Nooo. If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay. If we could just eat first. I like "godsend." Hi. I was worried I was early. Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them. Hi. Right back to you. I can't be. God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you? Go ahead -- what?Okay, sweetie. I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this. Sorry. Go ahead. How horrible. We'll be fine. You'll be fine. Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans. What? It's Paul. Ernie, they're calling from work.Uh-huh. The way you were looking at me, I just went. Yes, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.Never felt better. I've been working out. What? Yul Brynner. They're all dead. No. You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you. I've changed a lot lately. Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. Like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful. Sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. I'm just starving. Does she have PMS? I get crazy dreams and I black out. Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair. Nearly four. It's not just in my head. What else is there? It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and... Good. Except for PMS. No, it was another woman. Oh, on my wrist. There was a sale. At Victoria's Secret. No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom. What does that have to do with me? Mom! Jennifer? God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower. Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive. Hello? Yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. Then the PMS should be over. I wish I only had your problems. I thought you and George were getting married. Did I kill a guy named Benito? About Mark? Carlton? The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn't you see "American Werewolf in London?" No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself. But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me? I'm just afraid I'll hurt Peter. I think I love him. I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean. I'm cleaning my stove. I think I already have. So what do I do? So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this? Guess she never found true love. Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her. Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years. "Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf. The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf. Peter keeps asking me out. You're such a good friend. Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works. I think I just got my period. Peter knows something. What the fuck are we going to do? Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in. No. You should have seen it erect. That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor. I could smell another woman on him. I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him. You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating. You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you? What? Why'd you do that? Why not? There's been a murder. I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police! Yeah, I guess. Mark? I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there. Holy shit, I don't know. Okay, I gotta go. Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession. Oh no. Shit, I guess I missed work. I've been here. What day is it? Hello? I don't know. You have to take Sammy. He's afraid of me. I haven't gotten it yet. It took me an hour to clean it up. That was not in my head! No, last night I think I chased Carlton around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts. Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf! I put it down the garbage disposal. Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter? No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him. Jennifer. A severed arm. It's bloody and... I'm not sure but it may be Carlton's. There is a man's arm in my bed. I look like fuckin' Chewbacca. Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you! Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy! No you don't, believe me. I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS. Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault." It is so hot in here. Oh my god. I've never had that before. I've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "Hey there beautiful." What did he say? You're just saying that. I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate. Okay. I guess so. It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep. We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked. I looked like an Italian man! I'm freaking out. I'm like an animal and totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy. What the hell is the tampon test? I don't know much about him. How do you know if a guy is decent? I don't think I've ever actually liked anyone I've dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup. I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat. Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over. I wonder if he's married. He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up. No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in the dryer already. My vision got worse again. And my bra finally fits again. I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out. He was trying to get into my apartment and... I know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed him! I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me. I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory. I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone. No. I don't think so. Did I kill him? Of course not! Why would they exaggerate? And he was ripped limb from limb? He's dead? Am I bad luck or what? Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them. Holy shit, I'm a freak. Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look! I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay? Maybe they have to pee. You're so lucky you have George and don't need to go on dates anymore. Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea. George bit you? I think she broke the skin. Even on sale that stuff's a fortune. I worked all week to pay for a bra. Can you believe she fuckin' bit me? Where are all the mediums? I don't know. What do I need overpriced fancy underwear for? Shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie? Or if there's a full moon. No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye. Only to see. You're just saying that. I'd kill for just a little bloated. Sorry. It's just so bad lately. You're so lucky you never get PMS. My date always pays more attention to you than to me. He hasn't said one word to me. I wonder what it's like being you. Being noticed all the time. I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes. He's a very talented musician. My shrink says he's not so bad. Translation: a total geek. Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me. I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right? Uh huh. So pee. You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else. You don't have to pee. Oh come on. Knock it off. My apartment's just such a mess. You should have gone at the restaurant. What? Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight Gregory. No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS. I'm really tired. I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner. That's great. Highly original. I'm not really hungry after all. Starving. You're kidding, really? I do development for TV movies. I know. Take your shower. Mark. My bra is my biggest supporter. Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me. You think that story's gonna make me loan you money? So pay them back and apologize. This really isn't a good time. It's Mark. Where'd you get the bike? You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me! Yeah right... You better go. Worried about what all your girlfriends might think? I can't help it, it smells so good. Oh my god, I'm sorry! No. You never say that. Since when do you care? No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them. No. Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about? I think we should do something with strong female characters... I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims. A little. How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story? Your desk. On your desk. On your desk. Here's a towel. Okay. I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that. What about... those guys... I might have... Worse than this? Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child. No. It doesn't work that way. Men can't get PMS. Unfortunately. Be careful! I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you. How do you know? Peter I love you too but... Go away. I might hurt you. I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away! No you can't. It... it gets so bad that I become a werewolf. You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day? Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really. NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever. Hello? I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs. They do? Oh no... I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely... They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper. I love you too. Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it. No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it. No, my bite's a lot worse. This is a lot worse than "Betty." Interesting possibility. No, but thanks for the warning. What's that supposed to mean? I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now. What happened? No, I got it. It's okay. Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd? No, why? But you said the bodies were ripped to pieces? Mark wouldn't hurt a fly. It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them. Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second. Uh.... hi! Everything okay? NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first. No. Nope, nothing in it. I'm sorry -- I'm on edge today. Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You following me again? No. No, I'm fine. Maybe I should go. I mean... I don't want our first time to be like this. My period? No. What's wrong? Okay, you busted me. What are they for? What are those? Goodnight. Yeah. Maybe. I really gotta get going. He's bad news. He cheated on me, he insults me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date. Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up. How about you? Briefs or boxers? A lot of people don't wear underwear. Like what? I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild. I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective. Oh my god, by wolves? I'm sorry. Used to? Did it stop finally? It's stupid. Oh, it's nothing. No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently. I'm trying to stay away from caffeine. That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me. I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag. Intriguing? Are you following me? I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door. We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it. Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!! We didn't have sex. I don't know. I don't remember doing it. I ate a guy last night. I think I'm a werewolf. That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes. No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport. No, I have a cat. No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone. What makes you think I was the last one? Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me? No, take it. No, I said it was our first date. No, it was our first date. Yes... I... we had dinner. Oh my god, what happened?Sure. See ya. Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over. Frida? You okay? Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay? We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me! No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with. About Benito. I think George knows. No. I won't let you do that. I guess you'll find out. Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine. You'll get through this. You were fine for over three weeks. You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself. Fall in love. What choice do we have? The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet. She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her. "The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark. This is from a scientist in France, Madame Sconce. "The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. My suspicion is that the only cure is true love." Check out what I found. We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life. Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you. Symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells... So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web. Does that mean this whole thing is over? Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you. Hide him. Tell them you'll meet them outside. Ignore it. You expecting someone? At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark. Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves. If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead. Why the fuck would you do that? You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control. How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George? There's kind of this guy I'm seeing. First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night. DON'T call the police. What happened to his tooth? He's been here all night? Did you get rid of Mark? I'm stopping by later. I'm worried about you. Bye. Get rid of him! Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or... And he was missing an arm. Frida, Carlton's dead. Tuesday. Are you okay? Frida? I was worried to death about you. I've called you for two days. Where have you been? Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me? Maybe the blood was from your period like before. You're delusional. Maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. And the severed arm... well I don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head. You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs? And what makes you think you killed a man? So where's this infamous arm now? Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now. You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you. Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone. It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that. No they're not. Geez, I wish I'd get it like that. You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting. I still thought it was a purse. Charming Carlton. I think he called you beautiful. Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great. Great. George is meeting Carlton first for drinks. We can meet and go together. It'll be a blast. No he didn't. Come on, I don't want to be alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me. Hey, Carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us. Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone. How'd it go with the cop? You have to stop being so self- critical Frida. You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out... Give him the tampon test. Hmmm. Sounds suspicious. Frida, I'm your friend. I'm not judging you... You didn't sleep with the creep did you? Why didn't you tell me? You said you hadn't seen him for a month. Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him? He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar. Rule one: always wear make-up. Uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that. Are those Mark's? I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses. At least your PMS is over. And then? What? Why the hell did he do that? I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years. Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads. You don't think so? You either did or your didn't. No, did you fuck him? So did you do it? To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back. I'm sure they were exaggerating. There you go, blaming yourself for everything again. Hey, did you get contacts? You are not Frida, we all have a little hair there. I didn't even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that, it's no big deal. I don't see anything. Maybe just a little. Where? They better. Of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something. Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?" What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom." Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark. I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away... What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room. And she got the medium. Frida, grab that red one. There's a sale. It's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself. Come on, it can't hurt. It's not about him seeing you in it. It's how you feel. You'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. It's an inner thing. Okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. Victoria's Secret. Or if your boyfriend's an asshole. Try to get through dinner without them. You have beautiful eyes. Can't you get contacts? Do you really need these? How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out. I get a little bloated sometimes. Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men. Maybe he's just shy. People notice you Frida. So don't look in his eyes. Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out. Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job. Anything's better than Mark. Well that's not going to happen tonight. George said Carlton's a nice guy. Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade. She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her. Take some allergy medicine. Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves. It's so bad she becomes a werewolf. Tell her I'm eating. So now being with Frida is lucky? I thought you said she was a flake. I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along? She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous. Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell. Yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. It only works if you're on good terms. So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger... See he was cheating from the get go. I don't know, I guess the outfits are cool. And I want a big gun. I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up? You want her sheets? How the hell is that your business? Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if... You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you? We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples. No it's mom.Yes, I did. Yes, you can make sandwiches.... Only children are my favorites. That means you, MaGee.... You're welcome. I was the one who cried. Did you hear what I said? Come inside.... Not today. Come on, Thea.... Come on, sweetheart.... It has its virtues. It hasn't fallen down yet.... Don't bother Hoagie.... Thea.... You'll spoil her. Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us? I don't know.... How could you do that? Your own daughter.... She could have been killed...You knew and you didn't tell us...You let your mother think.... You knew...? The doctor said she should be all right...She's in shock.... Thea was attacked by a shark.... Where have you been...? Close the door. I have work.... No.... Then don't come any closer. I don't know...You...I don't know. We don't have anything straightened out. You're uptight about something ...what's wrong? Because.... Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap. I'm trying to get ready for.... It doesn't take much to remember what day they come.... Tell Matt he should be here.... We need beer.... We need milk.... We forgot to stop at the store. It sure is good to be home.... Like mother, like son.... Chicken.... I've always wanted to ride one of those.... What do I think? I think it's a lovely idea.... Where are you going? He was doing his job.... He told me you both did.... We'll be there.... Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you.... Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens. Whatever happens next..... It's beginning.... At least he doesn't have a beard.... You want to try your hand at something...? You're not interfering, Ellen.... Henny Youngman.... I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub.... Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry.... I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished.... It'll grow on you. No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....You make sure they come? We will...We'll have a lot of time together. What are you going to do now? I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it... It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.... Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me.... I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious.... Beginning of what? All he did was kiss me.... Do you enjoy dealing blackjack? I'd be afraid of losing.... You caught me.... I shouldn't interfere... My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock.... I can't help it.... Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...? About spending so much time working in the water? I like it. Really.... I'm not on vacation.... Don't be late. A small one...Your brother won't be here.... He heard that. I'm on the phone.... The fish. Check it.... Hello? Thea who? I know it's Thea Brody. How many grandchildren do I have? I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl. I know you're five. Are you all right? Let me finish dinner before you eat it...Chop the peppers.... I see what you're doing.... Serves you right. Will you please stop.... That.... Stop that.... I'll miss you.... I'll be in to read you a story. Thanks for the consultation.... I almost forgot.... What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...? No one. Nothing. We've got to get this finished before the tide comes in. You're coming, aren't you...? We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it.... Your father was six then. Just like you.... No, no...It's too dangerous.... Thank you.... I never.... It's too dangerous.... I'd like that. I need to be away from here. Yes! In a minute.... We will...We'll have a lot of time together, Michael.... Promise me.... I want you all to come to Amity this summer. Why'd you come out here? You hungry? It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe. You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity.... I'm your mother. It's my job.... I'm worried.. We haven't had our.... I'm leaving in a few days. I don't want to do that with you unhappy.... You and Sean used to make.... You look tired.... It's late.... Children are never satisfied. I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael. I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back. Now show your mother what a good dancer you are. No more sharks. I'll stay for another week, then.... That's it? Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne.... It's not easy. None of it is. I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try. I finally figured that out. I'm going to do my best.... Will you let me finish. I've been working on this all day. I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work.... He's not chasing and I'm not running. And that's ridiculous.... I enjoy his company.... I am. You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water.... You could teach...You could.... I want you to give up your work.... Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window.... I'll be all right, Michael. We haven't had a real talk, have we? We'll do that before I go. How are you doing? I'm fine.... You were a monkey.... I didn't mean to start that.... Oh, I didn't mean.... I'm being such a Grandma.... Oh, it looks like my uncle's. He taught me how to sail when I was a kid.... Your brother's dead...Your father's dead.... He died from fear...From having to go out there after it.... It picked Sean...It killed your father.... I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water.... Never again...Never.... I don't want you in the water anymore.... You're damn right I'm serious.... I want you to give up that terrible job. I want you to get out of the water.... You guys must be starving.... It came for him. It waited all this time and it came for him.... I can't.... I tried to tell you...I tried.... You sure you don't need glasses? The whole idea is preposterous.... I'm sorry...I.... Why? There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go.... Won't you get in trouble...? What? You're always taking time off.... That's hard to imagine.... I have my own little island. Good. I have two left.... You'll be sorry. No! You're not going to bet it all.... A big one.... The kind with an umbrella in it.... You promised me a drink.... I'm terrific... Come on.... I'm fine. Nothing.... It's wonderful.... The plane's turning.... You're impossible.... You're not going to tell me, are you? I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair.... Where do I pull off...? What are you doing? I don't know how.... I can't.... How can you just take the plane like this? Doesn't matter.... When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart. I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that. I know it's coming.... It was no accident.... Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares.... I...I can't explain it. It's just something I feel. I don't know why I've told you all this. I hardly know you. Flies the plane.... Can you just go off...? You must get bored easily. No....I don't know whether I saw you or not. You're my father. You're married. What are you doing here? I got it done. Mona? So you'll come to the wedding, right? It's temporary. Here. Yeah. I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino. And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had. You've got to come. You've got to give me away. In a month. He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying. Johnny Cammareri. He got hit by a bus. The guy died. Yeah. I'm getting married. You look tired. Here. Ti amo. Pop, I got news. You're not sleepy? Where's Ma? Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri! What! I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him? Ronny, please... You've gotta get outta here. He's coming. Ronny! I'm freezing to death. Let me go home. Let me go home. Why not? And you're not now? I'm afraid of who I am. I'm really afraid. I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me? The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever. This is where we're going! This is your place. You're late! He didn't come! I know what I know. You are guilty. I'm guilty. How can you ask me that? It's really cold. I wanna go home. No thanks. I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick... Beautiful. Sad. She died! That was just so... awful! I like parts of it, but I don't really get it. They get some turnout for this stuff. So. Where are we sitting? For what? Kinda gaudy. Who painted that? I thought I'd try it. You look good. Hi. Alright. Where's the Met? Alright. What are you talking about? What? But that's cause he don't know! I'm telling you you can't. Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding. Snap out of it! Why not? Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins! Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him! That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life! What did I do? You don't get along with anybody! You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo? I'm marrying your brother! I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again. This time I was trying to do everything right. What? What have we done? Oh my God. I've never seen a moon like that. That light. You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry! Get all of me. Take everything. I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me. All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny. I was dead, too. Me neither. Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed. Where are you taking me? A wolf without a foot! I am looking where I should to become a bride! Because I have no Luck! No! I'm telling you your life! The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again! I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf! You really are stupid, you know that. You think so? You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey? What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. Just Johnny. Seven years ago. Stupid. So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? Why what? Yesterday. Instantaneous. Bus hit him. He knew my husband who died. Loretta. You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood. I know that. I do what I want. I'm making you a steak. But that wasn't Johnny's fault. That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? Maybe I should come back another time. I don't understand. Excuse me. Yes. Do you want... I'm going to marry him. Yes. Let me come and talk to you. He's in Palermo. I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come. Johnny. You? No. Hi. Yeah, I'll be in. Bye, Aunt Rita. I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita. Right. I got things to do. Where's the ring? In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress. And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! WHAT? I have no secrets from my family. Johnny, I have something to tell you. I can't. I need my family around me now. I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying. Have you told her we're getting married? How was your plane ride? Sure. You have a brother? Who is he? You've made me very happy, Johnny. I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up. A month from today? Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set. How about a month from today? Then let's set the date. How near is she to death? What about the wedding? So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time. What time is it? You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down. Yes, on the floor. Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down? We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage. You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck. Are you proposing marriage to me? Bobo, take the cart away. What? I shouldn't. What's the matter? You never have dessert. She was too young for him. Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too. It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride. You don't want the fish. Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more! WHAT!! She was dying! He's with his dying mother! What? He's in Sicily! Where's pop? No. Are you drunk? Everything's different. Well. I don't really know where to start. Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old. What! How do you know? Thanks. What's the matter with you? I don't wanna talk about it. Hi. Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat. Where's that card? She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth. I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny. Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there. I'm thirty-seven years old. I got married before, you didn't sell. Pop don't like Johnny. No. Pop. Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. No. The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT! Hi. Why ain't you at the store? Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go. No. What about the moon? What's the matter with him? Hi. Alright. I know. I know. I... a... slept with my fianc�'s brother. Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc�, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.It's Johnny Cammareri. Is there anything you want to tell us, honey? Hi Loretta. Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? What's the matter? You look crazy. Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff. We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag. She's got it. What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc�'s in Palermo. You got me. Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you? Shut up. They'll hear you in the back. You were a tiger last night. You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old. What would he be doing down there? Is who down there? What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon. Oh. What? What? Marriage is happy news.Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo. And go to confession. I want you to stop seeing her. Have I been a good wife? Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother. You're welcome. I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else. Cosmo? Where you been? Why you drinking so much? Well, what do you wanna talk about! He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die. You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo. You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? Again? Johnny Cammareri. Who's dead? Oh God, that's too bad. Do you love him, Loretta? I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning. It was a miracle. She recovered. No more he's not. Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night. No. But I have a hangover. Are you drunk? Your hair's different. What the hell happened to you? A wife knows. Cosmo's cheating on me. Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night. Where you been? Did he tell her? How's the mother? No. He don't. And we'll sell the house. What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over. Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby... So we'll sell the house. Why not? Will you live here? And who's gonna pay for that? Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him? Okay, I'll tell her. No idea. He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question. No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question. That's it! That's the reason! But why would a man need more than one woman? That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women? That's incredible. You're kidding? A miracle. Well, that's news. What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo. Yes. Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband. So. She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you. Come on in. Moving in? Good night. Sure. Good night. I'm too old for you. You're a little boy and you like to be bad. No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. No. Yes. Yes. Sure. What you don't know about women is a lot. I think it's because they fear death. Why do men chase women? I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question? I'm a housewife. Don't shit where you eat. There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it? That woman was a student of yours? What do you do? Will you join me for dinner? None of your business. She was just too young for you. I'm not disturbed. By you.Please Mom? I just don't want to be alone. Can we talk? Just for a minute? I had such an awful dream. I thought I'd wait for you. Mom? And you don't want to keep him waiting. He's full of shit. It's okay, I'm not tired. Really. I thought I'd wait for you. Hi Mom. Do you still...see each other? To old friends. I don't know. I'm busy with school. New friends. But I'll never forget the old ones. I think new York was just what I needed. So many people. I never feel alone. He's close... He's gone. It's over. Please don't die, Nancy. Please. Are you okay? They sedated me. We're stuck here till it wears off. Nancy! What's that? Joey needs us. I can feel him. He's heavy in the halls... That was different. I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl. Yeah, but I was really not good. I was on the team at school. I was never very good, though. Nancy? Would you sit with me awhile? That man in my dreams. He's real isn't he? When I was still a kid. My folks got divorced. After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing. I guess I didn't. When I was a little girl. Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better. He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop? But...it's just a house I've dreamed about. I dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night. I -- I think so!I'll get it. Please, I don't mind. I'll need to take her things. I'm sure you would. Just some answers. There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen. All good kids, smark kids. I'm serious. Did she always have nightmares? Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt? Kincaid -- we should find the others first... You didn't think we'd let you go alone? Last time, it was me against him. I wasn't strong enough...alone. He wears a dirty brown hat. He's horribly burned. He has razors on his right hand. I know who's trying to kill you. No, she's right. I'm so proud of you all. Tell Neil I... I think so. Let's try this way. Kristen, can you pull us out? He's too strong! He was never this strong! I don't know. How do we find him, Kristen? Freddy? You never lose a gift like that. You just forget how to use it. How about it? Will you try? You did it the other night. We're not always as good at things as we'd like. You like gymnastics? Sure. He's real. It's an amazing gift. Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream? I used to live in this house. You pulled me in somehow, didn't you? Thank you. It'll be my last chance. Pleese? But Max, she needs me. It could mean life or death. Thanks, Max. I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they? Max, where's Kristen? Why is that? A little basic, but nice. Crossed over? It's over. It's over. People are still dying. After all this time. Stop running away from it. Daddy, please...don't make me beg. You owe me. I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good. But we need to know where the bones were hidden. You know what he did. He's doing it again. That's not true. You're the one who's trying to forget. It's been a long time. Neil, it's no use. You saw how he is. No... I'll be okay. Just give me a minute. There's only one man...and its time for him to talk. They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains. All right. Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do. Assuming your mysterious nun in right. Don't you think I know that? I don't have any choice. What are we going to do? Take it slowly. Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible. We made it. Neil, we made it! We can try again. Take us there, Kristen. Remember -- open mind. Only if you're willing to put aside everything you've learned and trust me. Can you do that? The truth. Then maybe you're ready. Stop blaming yourself. C'mon. Let's get out of this rain. To who? Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow? Do you? You told me they're survivors...and they are. But how much longer they survive is up to us. I used to be like them, Neil. I know what they're going through. Just until we get things under control. That's right. All right. Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being. That's what I know. What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams? I'm serious. It was. Neil, do you believe in other realities? My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart. My mother's dead. Died in her sleep. Must have opened while I was away at school. This is nice. All I can say is this isn't something that's just going to disappear. you're all going to have to face it. Fight it. And if you're willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...I think we can beat it. Didn't get much sleep. Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away. Call me Nancy. Call it a passion. I've got to get going. I've had some experience with pattern nightmares. I wouldn't be so sure they haven't. Oh God. Anything? But nightmares are the common thread? Tell me about the kids. We can't get to her. I've tried. Okay, straight talk only in here. Sshhh. No time for that. Come on. Freddy Krueger. He was a child murderer before he died. After he died, he became ...something worse. Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me. I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong. Your dreams? Neil, please -- You can't! They'll be defenseless against their dreams. And what are they?Then why is there fear behind your eyes? I do not marry tonight. Should I be? Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth. Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. Every ship but the four you sent. Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. He will come for me. My Westley will always come for me. He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship. If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man? Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done? You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day! And what am I? Nothing you can say will upset me. You mock my pain! On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces. You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream. He knows I do not love him. I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know. I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you... To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned. Who are you? Well, no, we sort of skipped that part. But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife." What? I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast. Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me? At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?" Oh, Westley, darling. Westley, why won't you hold me? We did it. Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s? We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here. What? -- go on -- But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago? You? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 58. We'll never survive. I will never doubt again. Well ... you were dead. Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly. But how can you be sure? But what if something happens to you? I fear I'll never see you again. Farm Boy. Fill these with water -- --please. Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.Maybe he won't. You are sick, that's why he's here. Your grandfather's here. Guess what. You feeling any better?Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us. You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom. Any more like you back home, Clark? You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me. Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off. I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a farm . . . see what the slow lane is like. No mind, it's only antique Irish linen. Let's sit down. They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony. Clark. . . ! I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild! Shouldn't you pay the cabbie? . . . Let me get my purse. Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony. I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic. Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . . He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . . . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me. Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 60 pounds. Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up! I feel kind of light-headed . . . No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore. Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species. What about here? That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold. My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you? Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials. This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance. Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive. You're late. Very late. Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date! That's just it! You don't have to flaunt it. You're no slave to fashion ... although ... But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful... It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.' No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster. I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism. Stuff it. Daddy . . . ? I know Daddy. I'm worried about him. Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went dancing . . . for a story . . . Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night! Not so fast! All trips are canceled. We pay for wire services. And what we don't get from them, we'll invent. He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . . oh, it's a long story. What's that? What's he going to say? Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he? Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . . Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds. Clark. He's late again. I can't figure him out. I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me. Daddy loves to whip up campaigns! People eat it up. We'll make this kid a celebrity. The whole world will be waiting for Superman's answer. I think there's an angle. Superman gets mail here? But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich. I think he's kind of cute. Is he for real?Everything is gone, now. But then I had a brother and a sister left. I already lost everything once. How long has - Surely she is older? I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest. Do you think we should take her up to bed? Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness. Somebody couldn't wait until dark. I know for a fact he didn't take Jonathon. Jonathon went off by himself. Finn ... Stop it! The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me. I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon. He'll murder you when he finds out. You did what? You <i>are</i> cold. Where have you been? Finn - Well ... yes. All right. But - Who's there? You're not so old yourself! Do what? Oh, I see. What did I do wrong? Finn, there's a splinter in your left foot. If you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester. Is that all? Get away from me... What about school? She's not accustomed to being ignored. I can't go home because there's no home left. I want to go home. I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once. It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside. Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph. I saw his teeth in the bathroom. Is there anything else I should know about him? A sin against <i>what?</i> I did like the music. I like plaits. He's a pyjama case, really. I can manage. There's no mirror. But you're Irish! In the play. She was married, by my age. And Mummy. Mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. Well, not <i>that</i> much older. I'm not too young. Juliet was my age. They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us. 'Have ploughed the stormy seas - ' It's all right, Finn. Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen. Victoria - I'm Melanie.I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own... Hi. You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes... You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before... I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life. Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud! Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing. Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision. I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen. So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy? You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler... Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much. ...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours. I'll let you know. Do you think you're ready? You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection. Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone... I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio. ...isn't it perfect! I don't. ...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything... You have modest wants. I like that in a man. So, how did your conference go with Gordon? If I could have anything... this would almost do. He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper. You really do believe in destiny? I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and... my first yuppie. What if I have a previous engagement? Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant. Where is it? You got it, a great spender of other people's money. Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray. Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this, you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration. Oh really? Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June. I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week. Aha. Poet or philosopher? Oh yes, I remember you. Excuse me. You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill. Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon. I can't...and I won't. Because I don't want to see him hurt. I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal. No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?... It's over you, Gordon. It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up. Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on. Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come? Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright... ...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy... All right, Bud... let's do it. Too much to do...but I'll walk you out. ...and if I did, what's in it for moi? Yeah, right... Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you? Okay. So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer? What was that? Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal? Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
