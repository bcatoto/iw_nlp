Thank you. You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food? How did he look? Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet? David? What shall we do? No, a cab will be faster. He's fine. We'll come right over. Yes, Doctor. Yes, I should think so. No, not really. No, why? Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean. He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo. He's here. What shall we do? Dr. Hirsch? Surely you're not suggesting... No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone. And what else? Yes. Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know? David says Jack comes to warn him. Yes. Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend. He's not? At my flat. I'm off at midnight and... Yes, sir. It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have. Yes, I believe he did. No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor. What happened to them? He said 'Jack'. Yes, Doctor? Yes, Doctor. Dr. Hirsch? Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago. David, don't lose control. David, let's go now. Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and... We had an argument. He's being silly. He's playing a stupid joke, sir. David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch. Jack is dead! David, stop! David, what are you doing? But... Dr. Hirsch will know what to do. The next corner we can get a cab. Don't you remember? The zoo? David! Where on earth have you been!?! I'm off. There's food in the fridge. I've left those pills for you. Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay? David, do you want me to stay here tonight? It's silly of you to be apprehensive. Anything. Let me go now, you'll make me late. Tomorrow is the full moon. But, David. David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really? Of course. Yes? It's nice to see you. David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower. The bedroom. Bathroom. Closet. The kitchen. I would think so. What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends? Your dead friend Jack? You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right? Are you better now? A werewolf? Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room. All I am to you is a sex fantasy then? You're being awfully forward, aren't you? How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient? Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now. What? David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away. That's easy enough. Don't be silly. Can I get you something? Hello. You all right? Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd... A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right? Shall I read to you? Was Jack Goodman your good friend? I know. Twenty-eight. That's not really a very proper question. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you. What do you dream about? I've just started it. My friend gave it to me. 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain. I thought you were asleep. Let's try a little harder, shall we? Right. Shall I be forced to feed you, David? Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler? Call me Alex. Sorry. Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills? You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler. I'm afraid you have to eat something. You haven't eaten your lunch. Mr. Kessler? What? I beg your pardon? I thought not. Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck? No what? How are we feeling tonight? Right. The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos. Feeling better? Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this. No what? Hello, Benjamin. Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now. Why on earth do you say that? Chart says he's from New York. Yes, I should think. He called out just now. Yes, Mrs. Hobbs. Has he been refusing food? Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.I looked. I think he's a Jew. He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him. He all right? Bambi? Some, everyone does. An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep. Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you. It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex. Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning. Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold. Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that? Miss Price.You could have told them! That's very funny, that is. Oh, come on, tell us. Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh! No, but we're about to. Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it. Sorry, love. Hello, there. What can I get you? I beg your pardon? But I can heat some up for you if you'd like. No. We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea. No.SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT Really. What'll I pin this on? He was a President. Indulge? Did you /hear/ that, Oliver. Look. Look at that. Bert Schnick can see. Why...he's...dancing. Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor. As a matter of fact... It pays to know your way around, Oliver. Are you spoken for this evening? Overreact! You're the one with theories about conspirac... Oliver? I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this. We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips! Conspiracy is right. The Denton Dossier is... Sounds like my husband. He never came back either. At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break. Conspiracy? That sounds a little farfetched. Bert brought them over from Europe. They had a very popular series together. It's still rerun in a lot of countries. You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?' Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde. Everything's free there. Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man. Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off? Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview. I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative? Oh, Oliver. What are we going to do? Shove it, Ralph! Not at all. You have your life. And I have mine.I got it! I got it!!! Infantile regression. I got it! I got it!!! About Brad's family? LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits. Oh, Harry. What are we going to do? He moved all right! When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery. Well I hadn't. I was worried about inherited craziness when they married. I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?' He was adopted you know. TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON` You're practically naked! Janet! Where's that lovely dress I made you? Your father doesn't like Mexicans. You shouldn't have said that. Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents. Just what the Doctor ordered. I know. Come on in, my favourite show's just started. They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show. The Far East meets the Mid-West! I know. Oh my poor baby. We love you, Baby. Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby. We're not confused. And none of them worked?
