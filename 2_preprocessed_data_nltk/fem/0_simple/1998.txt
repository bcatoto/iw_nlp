Would that I could say the Same. So I'm still ... How long have I been here? ... love ... ... love ... ... love... ... preserve... ... power ... ... death ... ... death ... Knight ... ... head ... ... bottle ... Sir August...? What now? Promised? Who promised? Have we met? I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it? I've come to apply for membership in Brolly -- Really -- what happened in 1922? I have an appointment. As you see. Impossible? Mr. John Steed, please. Then who wins? Rules are made to be broken. This isn't a game. Your voice -- it's so familiar ... Quite a collection. Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ? Thank you, Steed. Next assignment? So am I. To find out who killed my husband. Who? The Institute ... the funding ... To you ... ? I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that. What are you trying to do to me? Watch me. I resign. After the cold war ... Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible. He tried to warn us ... Ropes? How curious ... Let me guess -- 'Father'? Hmmm ... I'll never marry you. What are my choices? How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter. Then what's stopping you? The result would be ... Such as? You're mad. Ring? Valentine, listen to me ... I'm already married ... 'Our revels now are ended.' But -- why? But I found you. All the clues led me here ... Too many cooks -- You killed my husband. Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ... You. Thanks, Valentine ... Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby? Pity your mother came, too ... Our little paradise -- just made for two? I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed. Have you any place in mind? Still a bit chilly ... '... in a beautiful pea green boat...' What kept you? If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't -- But -- You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect. Where are you going? Have a look at this. 'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception? Trubshaw again? What now? Shall we? When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit. What is it? It's called Black Leather. Have we been invited? Hurry? What for? I'm just now -- Aren't you coming? Why's he called 'Invisible'? I'm a wanted woman, I know ... Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody. ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children. No idea who. No idea why ... You lied. As far as you trust me. No, after you. Please don't tell me it's how you play the game. I'm playing to win. I thought you played by the rules. You're playing games. But you did suspect me. Is that all? Mmm ... what are you doing? It wasn't me; you have my word. And do you trust me? Yes ... ? Because you always obey orders ... I could save you the trouble. To kill me? You followed me. It was Peter -- I saw him ... Was I? Where am I? Steed ... ! Someone didn't want us to get to the party. This must be the last straw. Barely. Have I trespassed on a male prerogative? We're being followed. I saw him at Trubshaw's ... Is that what you think? Not that I know of. Explanation? Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ... Three agents killed by bad weather... That's what we were working on. Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ... The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'... Not quite. This is my field. But Thanks ... I see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... Hello? She had this in her mouth. There, there... Is that written in his shoe? Any ideas? Very good, Steed ... How on earth can you tell? I should have thought that was obvious ... I'm in mourning. You mean my other self ... Did you say formal? I must dress. No. But he must know. Incidentally, my double left you with this. That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised. But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style. You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead. Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you. I mean your man Trubshaw. Your bullet-proof waistcoat. I thought you were just overdressed. You were very lucky. Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank. You should be dead. How do you feel? So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How? Any other vices? June, July ... August? An eccentric recluse? No thanks. I have no choice. Why should you risk your life? Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking. How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work? Do we always follow Mother's instructions? Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first? That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know. And I suppose you're the knight. But why? What's the point? You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk? That place is so absurd, so out of date ... You can but I wish you wouldn't ... Steed, we really must be -- Or half cocked. I thought we were on our way. Do you? I had a feeling you would. Touche! My father always wanted a boy. A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating? We're not here to talk about the weather, surely. Mother? And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you? Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel. And just what is the game? Rules are made to be broken. Whereas you are. So what was all this -- some sort of test? 1922. Why the kippers? I had a spot of bother at the door. And you must be Steed. Please don't get up. Decontamination -- ? You don't believe him? Where's Mother? You're saying I have no choice. I'm no spy -- where do I fit in? I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed? I shall need a small plane. Let me guess: Wonderland Weather. ... and now? Well, I can't possibly go like this. I fail to see -- Getting to what? Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling and Valentine were somehow in this together? But that's absurd. Who's now vanished. Surveillance? By whom? I know all this. Peter's brother? But -- I see.Choices? Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel. The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle. With this ring my plan will be complete. One very small thing. A diamond 'cyclone' chip. A thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. If I possess that, my powers would be unlimited. My dear half-brother was developing it. But he suspected sabotage. He gave the chip to ... you, 'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But also your ring. Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure. Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples... Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air. Entirely. On the other hand Mad people get things done. Let me show you -- That's better. I say, isn't this where you came in? It's impenetrable, by the way ... Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring. You know, I believe she's actually jealous. Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here. Think of this as your second wedding feast ... Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ... You disappoint me, Emma. Can't you guess? For you. It was all for you ... Of course. I planned that, too. Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ... For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ... An unholy trinity ... A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ... Darling Emma -- yes, we: the true genius behind the Prospero Project ... Good luck ... Peter ... Emma. Ugh ... Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for -- Aren't you forgetting about something? You said ... one shot. If you say so. That's not playing by the rules. You wish. But did they teach you this? You're better than I expected. The last one you'll ever see. John Steed.What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone? You're all scumbags. Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are. Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew. You fucking little shit! You shopped me. Sorry. Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit! Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others. Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it? I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that. Well it is. But I know where I am. Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves. I got scared. But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M. No blow jobs. No screwing. All men are cheats. You're shaking. I'll take you up on that. My car's in the garage. Jack. Do you need a ride? How do I look? Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit. I'm Bella.Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you... Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am. Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months. Jack! It's Jani. It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you. Would you like a drink? I took the bandage off yesterday. Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better. The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats. Do you? Well, life's not fair. We know that. Thank you. Is it yes? I have to take the car. I'm sorry. I told you, all bets are off. Let it go. No, forget it. The bet's off. I want you to forget what I said. I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend. I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean. Next time it'll be my neck. These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you. You keep the ten thousand pounds. It won't. I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you. You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all. You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen. Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal. The point is, they want a man inside. My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino - They mean it. Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion. I know that. But you can now. I owe a lot of money. I'm in trouble. I didn't. That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before. Which side do you like? You don't like cheats, do you. What happened? He doesn't gamble. That's fine. Just an accident. Nothing. Toss you for it. I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. I must go. Let me pay for this. Do you believe in astrology? That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there? And the lies. Gamblers are born liars. I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother. Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there. Near the casino. No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership. I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar. To coincidence. That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me? You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink. Well, thank you anyway. You know where I'm from?How can anyone be that naive? What? Why did you take the money? You're already alone. Here...use a spoon. Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple. Nothing about you. It's probably easier for you to eat the rice. I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend. I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here. Really? I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time... Aren't you ever tempted to gamble? You were talking in your sleep. You will? It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong. -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I? I hope it brings you luck. No. Answer it! The door, Jack. Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it. Without hope there's no point to anything. Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack. There's no hope in it. I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you? Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and -- I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic. I don't like it. Well, that's our life now, isn't it? I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on. What are you doing here? You know the rules. Haven't you got a conscience of your own? What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me. Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier. This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started. Are you drunk? Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more. Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine. When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep. I loved it blond. Poor baby. This'll relax you. You're shaking. What is it? How did it go? What's the time? You've got such beautiful hands. I love you Jack, you know that. You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me. You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers. 450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training? How did you land that? What job? I want to hear it. You're my prisoner. Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you. Take it back. Till you sell your book. You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you. Where did you get it? It's not just inner beauty, is it? I won't be that long. No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer. I couldn't resist them.What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then? Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police... Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention... The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying... Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end? Killed? Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering... Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600." Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay. Certainly, Mr. Duke! Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you." Let's have lunch! There's no hurry! The race is over! But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning? Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand. Tell me. When will the doctor be awake? What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel. I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team. Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?No. But we can get to the west side faster. The JFK? In the rain!? Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway. He's not going to do it. Think we can fit up in there? Don't you think we have enough? What are you doing? What are you doing? Animal, I can't. My God. He's going after the nest. Yeah. Why are you asking? Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me. It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this. He stole my report! That's my report! Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared? Nearly four years... No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun... Well, I can be tough if I want. Animal, you don't think that's true, do you? You know how I spent last weekend? Walking his damned dog. Who was that French guy, anyway. Really? I'd like to find out. Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting. Oh my God! They're coming! The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system. Our network covers the Ranger games. Come on, the broadcast booth is right over here. I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here. I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs. I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. You never said it was off the record. Is this cause of me? Because of the story? Nesting? I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant? Are you sure? What else do you know about it? Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing? And you think this creature is one of them? And exactly what changes are you trying to effect? I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission? Sure. I'd like that. I'm sorry you feel that way. That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know. You're still mad at me, aren't you? So, you still picking apart cockroaches? Yeah, well... What? It's good to see you, Nick. You must have quite some harem. I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it. Wish me luck! Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue? Remember my friend we saw on t.v.? That's the problem. He did. Nick Tatopoulos. He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama. It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him! I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him. My life sucks. And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s. You're kidding, right? The warm feeling of helping your fellow man. Can I use some? Hey, do you have any glue in your bag? Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit. We? I don't think so. You don't understand, I can get us information... I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military... Caiman, wait. Take me with you. I can't. Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace. Mr. Caiman... Mr. Caiman, you're married. Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say? Just tell me, did you talk with him? Did you talk with Humphries?Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye. I never stop thinking about it, Detective. The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times. ... I think it would be best if you both left. Detective... I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy. Do I know you? Think Eddie had something to do with it? Do you know who did this? My god... A dead body? Bruce... what's going on? The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival. That would work. Call me Laurie, will ya? Please, get on the bus... John... John, you can't help her now. Just get on the bus. Get on the bus. Where are you going? I was trying to protect you from this... No. Yes. Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family. I was trying to get away from someone. Will, sit down... Oh, so now it's my fault? It's an option. Wrong. There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not. You're kidding with that answer, right? Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?! I know. I thought you'd never ask. Where are you going? I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want? My point exactly. See, we both agree. Forget it. You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top. Somehow his opinion doesn't count. No. And I should have a son who calls me "Mom". Looks like we're both shit out of luck. Betcha' didn't predict that. Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no." Who?! Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night. Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what? We've got to get these kids out of here... I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things. Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will. Yeah. Are you going to leave, too? Shit happens. No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth. He's my brother. Michael Meyers. My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode. There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange... I'm fine. I just need to lie down... What? Bye Will. I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything? Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie? It's not going to happen. He's been living out of moving boxes for three months. It's always John. Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix. Looks great. It does.I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College. I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid. Why am I such an authority? What is it? Where? I won't let you die. Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice. Done. Finished. You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life. What? I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle. Maybe later. Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan. If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition? Why did you take the back roads here? They're not safe. You'd know that if you'd planned. If you really want to do this... plan it out. Rest up. Train for it. Build up your body. Plan every stop along the way. How much money? Time? Really do it properly. This is all so -- by the seat of your pants. What if you don't make it? She was being symbolic. What if she asked you to fly to the moon? It's impossible. Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me. Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along -- I don't accept that. And your store? What about your new store? What about all your dreams? Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers? Thank you. A couple days to a few months if untreated. I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression. It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous. Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him. Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.Good. No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now? If I die, you'll know where to look for me? Maurice? When I was ten, my family lived in Pacifica for a year. I used to go to the beach everyday that summer. I never felt so happy, carefree. It was a magic place for me... That's where my heaven will be. Pacifica, California. I know where my heaven is. I think it's a different place for each person. That's okay -- really it is. Your father? It'll make it. It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken. Don't be so sure. You can change. Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech. Yes. I want children. I've changed my mind. It's one of those thoughts you keep to yourself. You like to take walks? Show me. Exactly. No reason. No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how... How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me? Then why? Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night? Are you going to show it to someone? Why do you polish it? Why do you polish that thing all the time? No I don't. I don't even know if you'd walk across the street for me. Anything? I want to be shown... Maurice would you do anything for me? Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore. What it is -- is the truth. ... Love is shown through actions not just words. We can do it together. Honey, I told you. If it makes you happy, we should just do it. What? Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today. It's just a regular day. There was no card. The flowers... they're beautiful.Yes. He's getting my sweater from the car. I said there was a breeze. I told him not to go. Forty-seven years. You should. Children are a blessing from God. I have four. Is it a boy or a girl? Good morning.Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. Well, I'd love to see inside your club. What about yesterday? Kicking that poor boy? I'm just concerned about my daughter. And you don't deal drugs? My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe. Is that true? Excuse me, sir. I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday. Have a nice day. Oh, let me get out of your way then. Oh, please, don't hurt me. Goodbye, sweetheart. Mm hmm. I can make my own decisions. At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better. Dear, I was thinking. Why don't we go to Paris next year? I've never been. Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling. Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything. Mm hmm. I'm sorry. Aaron? Oh, I hope so, dear. If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it. Oh, that has nothing to do with it. What's wrong? My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people. Oh, it's so nice to meet you. You know, you never tell me anything. He seemed quite taken with you. But I was dusting. Well, they were right out in plain view. You know ... ... whoops! What about the fellow in those pictures? Dating anyone? How are you doing sweetheart? I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. The motorcycle gang? Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls? ... What are they all doing there? I wanted to ask you something. Those motorcycles across the street ...? Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word! Well, once you're inside, it's nice. I wonder what they do in there? Don't they frighten you? They all look so ... He's an organic farmer. You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single. Poor man had to leave town. And I hear that other women came forward. Oh, it was such a big scandal. Men ... they're all the same. Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister. Oh. You need a cappuccino. She's at work. I'm her mother. Who is it? Forty-five? I thought it was only supposed to be thirty? I see. How much? This way? You mean it's dangerous? Ohhh. Do you know the East Village? I'm from South Dakota. Where are you from? ... And the children thought I should take a trip. Uh, yes. My husband passed away recently ... She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here. I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter. I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous. It's my first time in New York. Just a minute. Are you sure you got my bag in?Well, bye. And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring! I love you, Mom. I have to run. You remembered to call the limousine service, right? Mother! Here you go. I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing. Okay? I'd love to. You wouldn't be in the way. I like having you around. I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer. It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it? Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk. You know that guy in the pictures you saw? No, I had a dream about daddy. Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him? Mom, I need to talk to you. No, no, it's my fault. I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own. Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking? Mother, I ... Don, this is my mother. Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer. That's not true. Besides, I don't want you dusting. I want you to see New York. I don't want to talk about it. I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications. Behind the books. Mother! What pictures? No, I'm working too much, I don't have time. I'm good. That's why it's good you came to visit me. I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night. That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters. Uh-huh? That's New York. It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day. You'll get used to it. You don't like where I live? So, what do you think?Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that. Yes ... It's just that ... Yes. Ah. No. I want to know. What? Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing? What goes on up at Lover's Lane? Can I ask you a question? Mary Sue? Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast. I put blueberries in them just the way you like. I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering. I love you too. I'm so proud of you, Bud. And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold. There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore. I had to say goodbye. I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares. Thank you. What? And they won't be able to tell? Does it look okay? In my handbag. I can't go out there. How can I go out there? How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares? Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter? Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold. Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table. Like a drum. Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it. But I really should get home. What is that? No ... I've got to go ... Yes she is. She's crying. She's crying. Bud? Where'd you get this? I think it looks nice. I just thought ... It's beautiful. I'm sorry ... Hello Bill. I'm gonna go now. I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ... I'm gonna go now. No I'm not sweetie. I don't want it to go away. I don't want to put on some make up ... Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face. No I'm not. I told you, George. I'm not going. I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too. I told you where I was. Oh, George ... Oh darling that's wonderful! I always knew you could do it. How was your day?What? Okay. You sure you want to know this? ... Sex. It doesn't matter. Yeah ... That--and ... What do you mean? Sure. Yeah? Actually--I'm not real ... hungry. Thanks. I said, NO! ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ... Don't! Just let go. I'm busy. Oh. I can't. So. What are you doing? Trust me ... It's s'posed to happen, Biff. ... Why? Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to. Oh yeah ... Gorgeous. ... Lover's Lane. You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave? You want to get out of here? Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec? Oh, gosh no. Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think? Gosh. I hardly know what to say. Really Biff? The keenest? Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me. Um ... It's ... I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old. Right here. Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there? I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while. I told you. I'm like positive. What? Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor. How come I'm still in black and white? Can I ask you a question? Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils. No. She really liked you. Yeah ... Sure. So what is it? Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages. D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him? Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad. Nothing? What's wrong? But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther. Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in. Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ... Not directly anyhow ... I had nothing to do with that fire. Me too. Sounds swell. Um--hello? You want to like take a look? David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better. I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it. Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ... David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you? Well if I don't who will? Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you? You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before. So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy. Nothing. Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other? He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ... So what's the point? What do you mean? I've worn some kinky stuff before ... I could like kill a guy with these things. I like--really need a cigarette, too. Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ... I got lost. Oh here ... look at this! I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them. It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank? No way. Can we do any better? Those are my friends. Hunh. Does he--you know--like "me"? Who's that? Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT? No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you! Play along? Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR! You know him? We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! Oh God ... I still don't see why we're doing this. All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something. I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God. Neither do I. What's going to happen? Noooooo! Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty! What did you do? What happened? YOU get lost! God, David. Just give it to me! Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life. Lemme see that. David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ... Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO! Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here! Pleasantville Marathon? David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes. What are you doing? Oh GOD ... This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes! What happened? Free? Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here. That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty. You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty. Yeah ... TV repair? Cool. So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight? Yeah ... Saw you too. Hey.I like calling you David. You're gonna forget about me. Where are they? Can I open it? It's beautiful. Where'd you get it? What do we do? Real rain? What's going on? Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you. I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet. You want some berries? Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here. What's that like? Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean. Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes. How? Out there. So what's it like? You don't know? Do they have those ... Where you come from? Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street. Sure ... Where would we go? Oh ... Hi. Keeps going ... No. I baked them for you. No. I baked them for you. I baked you my oatmeal cookies. That was sure swell ...Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people? I'll be here. Mother and son. You arranged this...? You're Ro'tin, aren't you...? There's something in the voice. Would you be his friend Gal'na? I helped your mother bathe you when you were a child. She still speaks of you. There's a cavern at the base of the next hill... What's the rush? Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days... Jak'tahla? There are caves in those mountains. For someone so young. I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for... I just... haven't gotten around to it yet. It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn. Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception. You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them... When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment... You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find... Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time? More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change. This is a school... that's a student's work. She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans... ... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so. You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard. But not you. We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life... There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now. I've been shot at... thrown into the lake out of an invisible ship that's come to abduct us all... what's there to panic about? Deceive us? I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village? Then you must spend your life answering questions. Why? Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take us, except away from here...? Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures. It's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline... We've downloaded all the files on the duck blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son'a. Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here... Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'... ... Population three hundred million... And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up? I never kissed you with a beard before. Augh. On this ship, anything can happen. And usually does. ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that... ... I believe you... You're in quite a mood today. Why don't you try sitting up? This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures... Whatever makes you comfortable... Come in. Hi. No children? Was I doing something to your neck? What...? Why would we be involved with these people? Hmm, I should feel right at home with them... You should feel right at home with them. What are they interested in...? "Environmental concerns", again. An android could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a duck blind... The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place. Would you like a little clam-dip, honey? Would you like a glass of tea or something? He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya? You mean he doesn't like bad guys. This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up. Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom. Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up. The little shit lied to me about that guy! Puffy, get over here. You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night? An old flame? Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster. Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be. Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker. Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight. I'm buying bananas tonight. Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was? Bundt cake? Oh, yeah, of course, dear. Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper. That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid? I don't watch the new ones. Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep? What's a mook? What's he like? Good lookin'? So who's the lucky guy? Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment. That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you? I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people. Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife? These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius. Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.Stop it! Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!! I'm asking you to leave. Woogie, I caught you red-handed. That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know. Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me. You sent that? Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer. Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me. Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you. We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel. Sure. Are you okay? Warren! Forget it. It was... fun. All set. Turn it up, Magda. Huh... that's strange. Come on, what were you going to say? What? I guess. So... Yeah. Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest -- Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie. A fucking moron. Have you seen it? You're a movie buff? Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to? Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this... Sadly, no. Well except for the lint. Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone. How about -- ? Would you call that a portico or a vestibule? Is this one art deco or art nouveau? We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great? I know he's around here someplace. The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about. We will, but first I have a surprise. Here you go. What's that smell? Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka? Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys. Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime. That sounds like fun. They keep him confined? That's bullshit! -- He's in a cage?! No, I mean Isn't that a little politically incorrect? I beg your pardon? What's that? Are you... an architect? What are you doing with all these blueprints? How'd you know that? Don't you want to know my name? By the way, what's your name? Well, it was nice meeting you, again. Thanks. Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops? You own a home there? Nepal? Have you been? No thanks. Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing. I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections. I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life. Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve. Ah, she's okay. I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami. Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him. Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile. No I'm not. What's that supposed to mean? But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed. I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame. Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock. Where's Puffy? Magda! Holy shit... I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday. I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted. Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world. Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love. So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies. Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will. Why? Healy. Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies. Sure. Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...? The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits. This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love. Come on, Magda It's like that movie Harold and Maude. You know, a mookalone, a schlep. I don't know. He's kind of a mook. He's no Steve Young. Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range. No time, Magda, my show's starting. Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh. Magda, Puffy barks at everybody. You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move. Meaning? Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations? Have you been up all night again? Oh Jesus... You mean he's not a criminal? Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now. Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life. I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour. What...? Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and -- What's up? Can I pour you one? I appreciate you looking out for me. No no no, Tucker, thank you. I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies. Not long at all, but I really like him. Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me. He's a nice guy, isn't he? No no, the bigger the better. But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites. Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair? Pat does projects all over the world. Pat's an architect, too. Really. Get over here. Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble. But I think I'd be happiest... with you. Ted...? You forgot your keys! Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school. Go! Please leave. Then what the fuck did you do it for? What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for? That you put a murderer on my trail? Get out. Toy poodle! Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom. That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books. Why not? Ted... you're not that far ahead. Yeah... almost. You want to come up and watch Sportscenter? ...and then it was all over. We haven't spoken since. I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco. That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere. Well good for you. I bet it works out for you. So you're a writer? Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going Why don't you just move down here and marry me? We've got a lot in common. It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted. I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly I agree there should be more. Nitrate-sicles -- I like that. Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen. Twenty-two. We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money. You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen. Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker. Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers. Let's talk about you. I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak. Oh great, I ran out. On your ear, you've got something. What's that? Thanks. Hi, Ted. I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night? Nope, haven't walked the plank yet. There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution. Actually, it's Mary Brooks now. Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids? Oh. So... what brings you down here? Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that. By the way, how's he doing? That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times. I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody. You know I tried to call you for weeks after that. And did everything -- ? Oh my God... Ted. What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since -- Who's that? Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay? Ted, are you okay? Are you all right? I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears. Hi, Ted. 'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone. The prom -- you going? So who you taking to the prom? Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds. Oh, are you on the team? Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself? Thanks a lot, Ted.Teddy, be brave. I mean is it... is it...? Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here? Teddy, hon, are you okay? OH HEAVENS TO PETE! Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.Because...because he's twice the ant that you are. I could never go through with marrying you. I'm -- I'm an individual , and when I get married, it'll be to someone I choose. Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now. I miss him already. He's...he's dead. You don't have to look for him anymore. He was eaten by a praying mantis. Oh...and I was afraid we had nothing in common... So, um...how was your day? What did you do? General -- we have to talk sometime! A few ? Z! what are you doing? Oh no... There's something going on, Z -- You held onto this all that time? Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess. Come on, Z. This is all your fault !!! Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know.... You were right...you were right! Z, it's beautiful ! What difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire... Face it, Z, we're lost! We must have walked halfway across the world by now! How did I get into this mess... Well...I am the oldest. Well...no, but -- Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no. About five thousand four hundred by now. General Formica won't let me die out here. I'm his fiancee. Stop fooling around in there. Out here I'm just what? Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap. Wait, I hear something! Why didn't I listen to my mother ...why'd I have to go looking for trouble? Any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's wrong with me? We're going to die! My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life. Water...water... That's not a name! That's just a letter! Worker! Come back here now! Insectopia ? You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale! Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole! I didn't choose him. What kind of idiot would... ... choose who she wanted to marry? I was slumming it ! I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place! Ha! Don't make me laugh. You're crazy about me! That's why you lied and cheated to get near me! I -- hate -- you. No! There's no such thing as "just two ants." You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants! Of course! It defines society! To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself! How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess! I've been kidnapped by the village idiot. Climb up that tree and get a better view! I order you to find out where we are! What was that thing? SSHH!!! SSHH!!! Quiet -- sshhh!! I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER! OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER! He was a worker. I danced with him at a worker's bar just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I? No weirdly...You remind me of someone... You dance... No, General. I'm dancing with the war hero. Yes. I'm Princess Bala. You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you? Let me think. Hmmnn... Never. Bye! Uh oh. Goodbye! Gotta run! Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself? You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up! Why can't I just do whatever I want to do? Why can't I just go wild?! Yahoo! You're right! Really? Are you sure this is a real dance? What ? I work in the palace, I don't get out much. Wanna dance? Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper. Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises. And do Princesses do improper things? I'm the Princess, aren't I? The worker bar! Yes! That's where I want to go! The Club's so stuffy . I want to try someplace different. Mom! Who is that idiot? Yes...he's wonderful... You did? It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on. There ain't. You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime. Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop. No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door. What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes. Was a time I knew what was. Not like He punished me. I'm saying they came into my yard. I'm saying they came into my yard. Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop. No, Stamp. I ain't. Can't say. It's something can't be planned. I likes yellow. Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither. What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world. That's the last thing they took from me. If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them. Well what? I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker. Folks come. Folks go. ...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me". Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody. Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did... What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember. They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long. Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.Then what do I do? But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense. There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it.. You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt. THE WHITEFOLK? WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS. I WILL PROTECT YOU. Beloved..She's mine I am Beloved ..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine... And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear? Thank you. Yes sir I don't. I have my own. At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her. Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it. Yes? I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D. No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day. More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me. No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama. Don't pay to complain. They good whitefolks? In case of what? Fine. But what would I do at night? Ya think? I miss her. Yes ma'am. Yes ma'am.. Yes ma'am. I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some. Oh. I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin. May I come in? No..No that won't do... Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings. I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra. No. I mean work work. I want to work, Miss Lady. Mama? But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table. Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something. Mama let me help you. But mama.. MAMA! Morning, ma'am. DADDY IS COMING FOR US. DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH. Won't you be late for work? She likes to see you off in the morning. Should I wake her? That was fun. OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground. Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is. But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl. And he left when he found out what Sethe did? What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought- He knew Baby Suggs? You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew. You? What run him off? Tell me that! I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children. Till she showed herself. Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of. I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was. Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people. Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom! Her who? Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it. I don't know him that well. He ask, I give him anything. Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there. Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody. Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar. He's sleeping in the church. Better ask Paul D. Might see anything at all at 124. You sure? Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver? What you want there? Somebody invite you in? Out where? Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right? In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything. Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night. Be here. In case. They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that? Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help. I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her. You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too. Well, come on in. You letting in flies. I heard your mother took sick, that so? You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you? What you want'em for? Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin. What you want? Yes?What? Exactly. What happened to your face? Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well? Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself. I want a child. Well yes, what did you think this was all about? Fun and games? He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance. He has no money of his own. I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut. We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it. No no, the wealth was all Mother's. I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money. Father doesn't have any. Jeffrey-- It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's. Why did he think you had it? And who does? Finder's fee? What happened to your house? What do you do for fun? Uh-huh. Oh? Mmnun. Uh-huh. Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey. Jeffrey. I want you to see him immediately. Please Jeffrey. I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects. Do you still have that doctor's number? So Dieter has the money? Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with. You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are. Is he pretending to be the abductor? Huh? Autobahn. A-u-t-o. Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop. Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years. Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.' Her "co-star" in the beaver picture? Dieter Hauff? From who? She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim. And please don't call her my mother. She most certainly was not! Do you have any news regarding my father's money? Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor. Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man, and thorough. Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you. You will receive no bill. He's a good man, and thorough. --your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw. Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them. If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum. I'm getting to your rug. My father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to. Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous. This compulsive Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey. Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career Lord. You can imagine where it goes from here. Take a look at this, sir. Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word. Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these. I like it too. It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy. You're not interested in sex? Sex. The physical act of love. Coitus. Do you like it? Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski? Yes, I know about it. And I know that you acted as courier. And let me tell you something: the whole thing stinks to high heaven. Thank you. Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say. Whereas without batting an eye a man will refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or his "Johnson". In a sense, yes. Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal. Which bothers some men. The word itself makes some men uncomfortable. Vagina.I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise -- It's over, isn't it? Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is. It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't. I know. Take some of my blood. I'm not leaving without you. It won't work on you. Is it bad? I don't know. I woke up just before you did -- Are you all right? You make it sound like I'm already dead. I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night. Some. It's been slow -- My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart. You care about him, don't you? Is he sick? I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment. Blade -- If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins. Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall. It's dark in here. What am I injecting you with? You're hurt -- Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins. What is this place? Like what? So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real. How can you tell? You let him go -- An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk. I know this place -- it's a blood bank. Graffiti -- What are you looking at? You don't know that. Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself. You can't do this, he's human, it's murder. What are you doing?! And that's a good thing? Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them? But he's a policeman -- But, he could've -- You used me as bait?! How did you know? That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful. I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them. I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career -- And you honestly expect me to believe all this? What happens then? Why? You're joking -- I'm sorry, I -- -- but then I remember what an ass-hole you were and I'm snapped back to reality. Sometimes -- What? You haven't started in on the internal organs? Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us". I thought you promised to give me some distance? Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes. The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them. Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated. I don't know -- Look at this blood smear -- This isn't human blood. Get away from him! Blade -- You're a monster. But you use blood banks -- There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when -- You. LaMagra -- What happens then? How many of you are there? What happened to the power? On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure -- The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate. They've been using them to treat Sickle-cell anemia. Basically you'd have to re-write the victim's DNA, alter it so that the DNA will produce proteins capable of generating hemoglobin. Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia? All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood? I'll take my chances. And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge? How did you escape? He killed them? Why do you hunt them? No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. What happens if he doesn't take the serum? Why didn't you tell me the truth about him? Whistler! You've been listening in the whole time? So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way? So what do you use, then? A stake? Who are you people? What -- ?Yes, sir. Everything ? Won't say. Says he must talk to you. Why, yes. I�m sorry... It seems fine. Yes, sir. Anything wrong? You won�t regret this, sir. I�ve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompson�s office searched, as I believe you instructed. All clear now, sir. They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man. The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand. I�m your new assistant. Patricia Crenshaw. Sorry, sir.That's easy. You... They're dead, John. Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then... It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.Where's you friend? I don't take orders at all. No... Soon as I get over the heart attack... And what if I run into one of those things? You want ME to go up there? How about noise? Can you get noise? We don't need speed, just noise, right? If you blow up your boat, how are we going to get to the island? ...the minute you start your engines ...it's goint to kill us, isn't it? Finnegan... Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there? What? I was so goddamn close, Finnegan! So goddamn close to my island... I could almost taste the sand... So how do you get from the Bronx to the South China sea? You should talk... We can't just leave them here. What is it? What's the matter? You're saying they can think? How do you know that? Oh yeah? What kind is that? Right... You have a boat. Hey! I didn't have to come back. I don't know where it is! Takes one to know one. Self sufficient... Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one... Seen a lot of islands? So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides. Thank you, I work at it... I'm not rich people. What's that supposed to mean? You people. You don't have to be so touchy. But what makes you think there aren't more of those...things...back there? Hey! Hey! Where are you going? What are those things? Noooo! You hear that? What are you people talking about? Then who are you? The thieves. Who asked you to! Now look what you did! I'm not staying here! Why don't you back off? Nowhere... A passenger... Poolside? Or maybe not.My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's. You're a moron, you know that? What makes you think it's you? I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man. This conversation's over. Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how. I've never met him? I can't. How? We're screwed. Bullshit. You don't work there anymore, Bobby. For the last four years. The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income. I gotta go. It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you. Good. You're just what I need right now. There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The mob , Bobby! I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in. Eat your fish. I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto. You're not. He doesn't work that way. Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a-- Other than me. I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else. Yes. It's how he works. What answer were you-- Never. DePinto? Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto-- Do you like fish? It is fish. How's the trout?For that matter, I think you will too. I think she'll like this very much. Remain calm. I'll be right back. What size? What size? It's a little late for that. Very good. How 'bout Christian Dior? It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift. You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift. That's fine. Do you see anything you like?Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not? Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone? Pathetic and alone. What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer? The look on your face! You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid. You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again -- Sure. I loved it. No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you. It still hurt. A lot. You picked up that girl right in front of me. All the old men I know think about nothing but sex. It never crossed your mind? Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me? Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette. It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water. Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him. What's to be jealous of? Weird. Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them. These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny. This looks corny. Not anymore you don't. Doll. All right, then. He's interested in you for your conversation. We know what a great talker you are. Just thinking out loud. I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.You are right. Yes. We must put him back. Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone. The police will not know that. They will want to investigate. You must leave. You were not here this morning. He says here good-bye. I find it in his room. He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life. Oh, Mr. Jimmy. What have you done with him? It is my job. I did it when he was happy and it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk. I must wake up the master. What do I do? I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke. There is nothing you can say that will surprise me. I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast. Yes. I trust you. Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries. You and he are not doing things? You did not know? That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge. Yes! You know? What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other. No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The deed no man can name without shame? This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven. No. I have children, grandchildren too. I visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad. He is dead now, twenty years. Of course. I am married still. A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman. Why? Your wife? No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone? Long enough. Fifteen years. No. You are a guest now. You go in the living room. The Master is dressing. I am to offer you a drink. There is whiskey and there is iced tea. Expect nothing fancy. The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask. No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray. You will not hurt him? What kind of man are you? Are you a good man? I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine. The Master is waiting for you. No. I do not cook for them. My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food. That is my daughter. She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy. I will make it short. It must be up in your old room. I will look. I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ. No. But someone you can talk to. Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend. A visitor. Of course. This afternoon. Good night. You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy? She is horrible. He is not going to kill the old man? Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him? He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey. I am not forgetting your last brief chat. You remember what the doctor tells us. How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today? Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold. I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys. Which ones? I bring them all. Mr. Kay, sir. Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting. Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while you were in the hospital. He came cheap.Why? Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point? Why? How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go? I can't do this. I can't leave you... I don't care! We'd be together. One more time. Show me again. Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to -- I won't ask you to. What?! This is Mr. Booker, Robert. You missed a button. I am comfortable. Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese. How did you find out all that? That's very important to you, isn't it? Home. We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be. It is. It's lovely. Why didn't it work out? How did you meet her? Son? How long did you live here with your wife? OK. Yeah. Thanks. Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas... Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill? Poor thing. The answer's no. I can handle it! Shit. You too. Are you shy, Mr. Booker? She did? He's beautiful. Oh yes. I forgot. I have a way with animals. I thought you lived in Chicago? I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts. I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine. If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies... I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run. I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat. Well, I, uh... you didn't... You were married to a woman in Chicago? You lived in Chicago? Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain. Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world? It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to. That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me. You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that? What? Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron. It is cocktail hour yet? Branding? I haven't branded in years. Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim? Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later-- Well, that'll be a little complicated -- Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim? You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check. Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again! I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal? Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car. Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's... Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel... It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs. Mr. Booker, if I could just ex -- I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class. Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner... Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly -- I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized -- This is Annie MacLean. Go ahead... Hi. How's everything? Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful. Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home. What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim? Let's bring your bags inside. Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me? What? Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity. I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you. That's not true. What?... Oh baby... When? Tonight? Started what? What did you say? Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not. Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry. But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong. I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be. WHAT?! How can you -- I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you. STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!! Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing... I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and -- Grace, I don't hate your father. What are you talking about? Honey, nobody's trying to cure you -- Well... So you tried riding again? Grace? Is everything all right? Can we talk? Did you go riding? Thanks, honey. Does anybody out there want something to drink? You're right. Good. Well, one was for salad... Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way. No. I just thought... forget it. Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight? You got everything you need? Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you? You already did. Hi. He's still sitting in that damn field. There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it? Don't they believe in signs here? You buckled up? You cold? It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers. That's not true! Did he tell you that? That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this. I don't believe this! Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you! Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you? You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on? How long is this going to go on? This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this. I don't care. Would you like to see that? You don't. Oh. You didn't tell me. You should call your dad before it gets too late. Fine! IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!? Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine. No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough -- You want to take your bath? We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to -- What? Yeah? I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it. Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down... Have you decided about Pilgrim? Grace, I put it on the table near your -- I brought it to you in the hospital. It's still early. What's your next class? You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out. Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well... Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what -- Oh, honey... What happened? Dad'll pick you up today, all right? Why don't you go lie down? Liz is taking care of him. The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can -- Uh, yes... Sure, David. What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me? Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything. Exactly... David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you? Yes. We're suing. Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you. David? Where to? I have so much to tell you. Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow. What do you mean? Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"? I don't understa- What do you mean? Yeah, what? Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark. Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut? Let's not talk about that now. No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right. You don't have to explain. You have every right to come. You're allergic to hay. Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise. About what? Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her. Everything all right. Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off. Night. I know. We miss you too. Okay. You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know. Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new. Well, it's good that you're there. Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit? No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right. She will if you think she should. Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it! I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will. I can't say he's been all that effective with her. Why?! I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer... He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride. I'm not asking you to. I'll do it. No. I was just researching. Calm down. I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way... Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her. He did, but... I think I can change his mind. About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses... No. Yeah. Why did you go? How was the dinner? Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time. You've got to stop doing that? Do you? Do you really? Aw... that's so sweet. You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early. Sing it to me, Frankie! Oh. Right. I'll call him. Okay. We're very lucky. No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up. I should go get some of her things. What did he say? Tch. What are you -- Robert, you leave it up these people...! That bag's almost empty. What about Grace? Yeah. Bye. I don't know. We'll figure it out. I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone. Sure... What's Grace up to? I should be in by two. Hi. It's me. What choice!!? It's so cruel. Absolutely. I made enough for an army. Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager? Oh, I don't know... You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... do their... work. You too, Diane. Promise. It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks. I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. Between you and me, I could use the time alone. Oh, how sweet. No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list. Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping. I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want. What? Sounds like something Tom would say. Frank's a good man. Did you always know this was the life you wanted? Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to. No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me. Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud. You and Frank ever take a vacation? But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe. Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was... I was there for that shot, actually. Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to. Thank you. You're all doing too much. I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one? She calls him Tommy... Where does this go, Diane? It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel. Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose. Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture? Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him. Of course not. Maybe we should give him another sedative. And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please. ... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is -- - See, what you can do for him --... Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so -- Well, of course, right... Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive... Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.Good luck to you, Annie. Promise? Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing. I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart. Well, I am going to go after lunch. He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land. Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time. Yes, it does. They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all... I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us. Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home. You don't seem to upset? They fired you? Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh? Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there. I'd love to go there one time... What was it like? I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt? No reason you should, no reason you should. I'll help you with the coffee. Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway. Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise. Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same. Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's... Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom... Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow. How's Peterson's holding up for you? No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place. Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner? Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah. Sure. Does your daughter want to come inside? There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom. Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean. Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter. You! They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy. What? I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long. ... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way... You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen! Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve? I have some brownies left over. Want one? Ain't brain surgery. Ha... Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York. What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.Great! Good. So do you. Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye. Tom's gone. Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves... Sure. Who is it? So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway... I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be... Why should they? Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will. Who's going to want me now? I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom. My period. I said... I started. LEAVE ME ALONE!! Yeah, well, you've done a great job. FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman! Well, now you know what it feels like. NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom. Yeah, you know everything!! Tom? I can't remember the last time you made him dinner. You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much. ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home? Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?! About what? Nothing. I'll take care of it. Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork. I thought there were too many forks on the table. I'll come. Why? There's no food in the house? If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy. Did he mention it? Did you ask him to come visit? We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. Dad wants to talk to you. I think they call it a pasture. I didn't see it. What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock." Gee, this looks like a fun place. Little. No, you just act like you do. Then why do you want to leave? He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him. You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to. You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it! Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something! What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it! What? You were never thirteen, Mom. I don't care. I didn't know I had to. I already did. This morning. When you went running. Fine. Whatever you want. I don't care. -- enough time tomorrow. I know. Fine -- I'll take my bath. I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me? Maybe they should put me down too. Mom? I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that. What about him? Doesn't matter. No, you didn't. I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India. Fine! Is that your version of a pep talk? I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home! Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all. Okay. I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough. I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!! You know, you're a good kid. I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody. Of course I have. Would you let me ride your horse? Why do you always wear that hat? Don't you go to school? No! No, you're only going to hurt him some more. I want to watch. What does that mean? Sure. I can't... not yet... I know where he goes. Are you afraid of anything? We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I can with my leg. I can't... Drive? I'm not old enough yet. That's not a question, is it? Isn't it like, obvious? Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK? She's an editor. Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day. Yeah? Jude, you okay? No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"... You want to go down or stay along the river? Do you want to go around by the old road? ...Oh, come on! You think the same thing! Can I come? I'll start a fire... So? You want to go to a movie tonight? I did. He said he had work to do until late. Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom? Did you notice -- no cane? I want to see Pilgrim. NO! Maybe... look -- just... No, I'm just not that hungry. Dad! I can do it, OK?! How's Pilgrim doing? Have you heard from Judith's parents?What do you mean? About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders? Where did you learn all this stuff?Then I'll call the mainland for a charter. I want off this island. Listen to me. He's here. Storm season? We haven't exchanged anything. Your what? It sure is a beautiful old hotel. You're okay. Thank god. No, you're not. I'm right here. Grab my hand. Come on, you can make it. There's no way to lock it. Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. Then, we fight -- I've got to see. We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose. Let him go. I believe him. Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. They never found the body. I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here... We've got to get to the radio and call for help. Karla! Cancer in a box. Nice move. It's okay...He doesn't believe me. That's his right. I'm starting to think I'm crazy, too. Some. The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there. Not me...no way... No. No way. Don't even think about it. I miss Ray...I tried to call him. Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- Karla! You promised. Where is everyone? I'll ask -- I will, and you remind me of the same thing. I'm the King of the World. Oh! Then, don't. He does work hard. But, he said he'd try. He's not coming. I thought he was just... Ray, come on. I want us to be together. Okay, okay. You're right. The number's unlisted... That could break the machine. Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here? Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers -- No. There's nothing between Will and me. I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings. I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed. That was heart attack time, Karla. What are you doing in my closet? What are you doing in my closet? You know me to well. I love it here. Never do that again. Ray...what are you doing? Ray...please try. I really miss you. Okay. Bye. Will you try...for me, please? We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... You know... Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. It's okay. No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. It just isn't. I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand... Ray, I can't... Why are you being like this? Ray, we're just friend. Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him. Wait, it's Nancy -- I don't know. Voodoo. Ben Willis. We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there. Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature. ...Why? I trusted you. Why are you doing this to me? He's in it with Willis? Did you get help? I wasn't dreaming. There was a body! I swear it! It's in my room! Are you sure? I really appreciate it. No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. No, no, no. This was really sweet... Oh, Will! I'm sorry. He did something to the screen...it, it, said... It's...him. Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore. It beets being on the mainland. You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning. Deep breaths -- Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood. What? I'm okay. Right. Now I remember. I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place. It was one year ago... It can't get worse. I mean, it's not like this was the first time I freaked out in class. I hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I'm this close from being thrown out of school. I thought I was over the dreams for good. I really did. I hadn't had one for months. It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me. I'm fine. I'm fine.What the hell would you call this? What about a radio? Wait...Did you say off-season? Julie, we're talkin' suites! That'll be just fine with us. Is that bad? Checking in...Karla Wilson. Is he? Oh, god, it's you -- ...Nancy? I'm holding your hand! Julie? I don't know... What do we do? It's too late for that. I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. Julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. There's no way off this place. Be careful, Julie. I know I don't want to stay in here. What do you mean? Come on, Julie. You saw his room. Julie... Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. I think we can classify this as an emergency situation. Just kidding. No, this is the safe sun. It's better than a day at the beach. I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it. Hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...What do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress? You get any sleep at all? Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see? Yes. Yes. Okay, I won't. Karaoke -- perfect. He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... But... I also promised Tyrell. Their stuff in there... ...and ours in here. Hello? Hello? Remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' I do for a weekend once every ten years. No, I'm the King of the World. Hey, sorry... He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. And I don't want to have to say I told you so... He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! Julie, you left four messages... Four. You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? I know it, and it feels good. Hi, Ty. Would you relax? We've been dating three months. He ain't stalking your butt. Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact. Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway. No means yes. Say yes. Yet. Nothing yet. Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street. Yeah, right -- whatever. No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time. i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them! I thought you were out of town! I thought you were out of town! You think that's a good place to hide? Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree? Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own. We gotta get out of here. Now. Hey -- I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle. Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet. You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie? 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. Tha's it. I've decided. I'm changing my major to finance. And going to Wall Street. They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. Am I right, sister? Rio, baby! Oooh, the mainland -- Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. I wanted you all to have a good trip. Honey, some folks just can't fly. Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on. Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance. If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it. I don't think so. It's pretty crowded. Why? He can't help us. How's Julie? Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James. To a great weekend -- I said we start having fun. And that means now. Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh! No. Yes? Rio de Janeiro! Still here...thinking... You mean Brazil, the country? Yes! Well, I'm in school and -- Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson. Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.Dinner? Again? Yeah, speak for yourself. -- But he does seem very nice. ...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me. Ever since Joe showed. It's like he dropped from the clouds... ...We're never all together two nights in a row. Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it. What's going on? And isn't it a lovely one? So sturdy, so straight -- You ate? I'm Allison, you're 'honey'. Did he? That's more than we get to do. He's cute. Love that name. Daddy! Come on, a name. His wife? Did you speak to the Governor? Yes, it is. But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know you love me. Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?" That you've been to Susan? They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love? I do it because I love you. Because everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you. -- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs. The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar. The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian. Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'. Hi, Daddy, what do you think? 'Goddam party'! It's for the party, Dad -- From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America. This is orange, from real Seville oranges. Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in. Annie made them. That's okay, Daddy. You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not. Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing. A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course -- From the Korean War. Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming? Now, I'm getting interested. I want to know more --- Whew, at last. Nice to meet you, Mr. Black. Daddy. Does your friend have a name? Good. Songs. What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play? And you could care less -- I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect -- No. Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it. But it's your birthday. Fireworks. Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept... Have you got a minute? Daddy! What will I tell Annie? Yeah, but -- Honey --! Paillarde of veal. Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'. What about the Mayor? Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's. You too, Drew. We've still got some loose ends -- Honey, please.Haven't you had enough of us, Dad? Look who's talking. You think so? Nothing's going on. Maybe he doesn't want to be alone. He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute -- That's your name? ...I'm here, aren't I? Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting. What's on the table for discussion? Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew -- Hi, everybody. Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief -- Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away. That's it. It's over. Get out. Well... goodnight. Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay? Drew, you're out of line. You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy -- ...See you tomorrow night. What 'business'? Hi. You think so? That's it? -- Yes? Hold me -- Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now -- But you're not. You're somewhere else. You're someone else -- You want me to wait for you, you'll be back -- -- That was the place... and you were the guy. And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that. Yes, that's why I said it. It's a saying. 'Love will find out the way'. Lightning struck. We caught it in a bottle. Don't let it out. I want to be with you, Joe -- Don't. That will come later. We know all that we need to know -- Then don't. It gets worse. And you can't tell me who you are. Where are you going? It beats a surgical, doesn't it? I like you in a black tie. For how long? Where are you going? More than you love peanut butter? Did you like making love to me? Maybe it's the draft through the door. He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing -- I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood -- You're here? And is your heart beating strangely? I don't know who you are. Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you? It was everything. -- I guess you haven't. I'm sorry about -- I said get out. Why don't you get off his case? 'To bed'? Where are you going? Gay? Girlfriend? Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married. How long have you been standing there? We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good. I am, too. It comforts you, doesn't it? I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you? Why do you love peanut butter so much? And I appreciate you, too. Excuse me? It wasn't an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome. I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'. I have to go, I'm sorry to say -- Joe, I'm with Drew. Yes. Patients have visitors, not doctors. That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm -- Watch me do what? I don't have any time to see you now. I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then -- Then why are you here, Joe? Joe -- I think you want to go to the west wing. Through there. Goodnight, Joe. Yes? I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying. Yes --? I can see why. I've got plenty of friends. No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home. Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth. Come again? -- What kind of childhood did you have? You act like you never had peanut butter before -- What are your intentions? To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool. I don't get it. You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset. Who are you anyway? And what are you eating? Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger. You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first. You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe. -- Can't seem to escape you today. What are you doing here? The fireworks are about to start. Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old. Oh, yes -- I love you, Daddy -- Daddy -- But what? Are you relieved? You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere -- What a night. I love him. C'mon! The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works -- Where's he going? What are you afraid of, Dad? That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom. That's always been standard, whether you like or not. Why? A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me? Love. Passion. Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. Well, they've arrived. Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe. Where is he? Where's Joe? It's something. When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing. Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten? What's going on? Then what will you say? Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"? The nature of it's in there somewhere. Raise away. Yeah, it's good to get together. It'll come back, Daddy. Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter. Incidentally, 'Joe' what? -- This morning. The Corinth Coffee Shop. He was looking for a doctor. We've met. Well, go get 'em, Pops. Are you okay? What is it, Daddy --? Daddy, what's the matter? Thank God. You're terrible. I won't. And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either. I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version. Bravo. 'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going to do my upmost -- That's all? Don't get dirty, Dad -- You're not listening -- So what's wrong with that? What were you going to say? And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me. Uh oh -- Probably. You mean like you loved Mom? ...There's a start for a meeting. I thought you were in a meeting--? You're only six-five once. ...Then don't. Yeah. I guess so. I hope so. Drew told me. Will you relax? I know it is a big deal day -- He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours -- Good morning, Dad. ...We know so little about each other. No -- Because I like you so much. Now I've got to go. Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you. Why? No, it was so right it scares me. I've got to go -- You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days -- You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry? 'Pro bono'. That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life? I've got patients coming in -- Not at all. Yes, I could. I have an office in the hospital. I could be her. Me? Internal medicine. How'd you know? So you're a one-girl guy? I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why? I agree -- What's the way? I'm sorry -- You and 'Honey'? Not at all. It was fascinating.Yeah, that's him. Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool. Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two. He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something. And the one driving the other car? Emil the Amazing. The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes. How's this sound-- What's free about it? I'm looking for work. So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about? Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored? Till it's not funny any more. What do you want, Jack? Yes. Yes. Lie face down on the floor. Who is it? Yes, it is. You're good. Who are you? That wasn't Jack's fault. No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after. She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc. I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that. Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. Battery was dead. He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in. They musta robbed fifty banks together. Buddy'll take care of him. Keep him out've trouble. He's Jack's conscience. Always has been. He tell you how they met? I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean. He said he was a card player. I could live with that. I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce. He said, "Okay." Jack's so easy going. He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband. Huh. Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks. It's all he's ever done. He did? I don't remember. Did he say about me? In the trunk? He'd call every once in a while. I don't know. He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer. He didn't want me to. He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes. He didn't hurt you or anything, did he? I'm getting ready to go out. You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. Would you like a Diet Coke? I know a Glenn. They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions. You were <i>both</i> in the trunk? Together? Go away, or I'll call the police. I don't know where he is. Wait in the hall! I have to get dressed! I'm not dressed. You say you perform in the Miami area? His assistant. Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years. Oh. Uh-huh. Yes.Thank you. Ask him his name. Any idea where I could find Buddy? Or Glenn? Till they got busted. Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught. I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself. Really. Hm. Did you know that when you married him? He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life. He called the day he escaped. But you spoke to him on the phone. Why not? You didn't visit him in prison. You mean, did he try to jump me? No, but he was kind of talkative. No, thanks. But you know what I'm talking about, don't you? About Glenn, don't you, and the second car? The FBI didn't tell you I was with them? From Glades to the turnpike. Then I left with Glenn. Call and tell you. What? Daniel, I wanna go upstairs. The manager's door is metal. You're gonna use a ram? They're in 7D. That's all I wanted to know. Yes or no, Daniel. If I get him, will you let me go after Foley? Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force? Sure, Daniel. All right, but... Yeah, I know. I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me? I'm at Adele Delisi's. Daniel. Listen -- Shut up. You'll have to ask him. You have to know what you're talking about. Have you ever shot a man? How many times have you been primary through the door? Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud? Go after crooked bookkeepers. Is that what you would've done? And what happened to Carl? When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks. It was an unusual experience. Oh... different things, prison, movies. In the trunk, yeah? Really? Huh. He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed. Coming to the Okeechobee exit... Isn't that my report you're holding onto? I wanna be on the task force, Daniel. Hello, Daniel. Daniel Burdon, please. Karen Sisco. You don't, huh? You can live or die, it's up to you. If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead. What do you want to bet? Put it down or I'll shoot. I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. Put the gun on the table. I mean, now. Leave it where it is. Wait, I know him --okay? Oh-kay... Hello? Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed. I'll need a last known address. Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter. Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that. Detroit, you must be pretty busy. No, I didn't know that. I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee. Yeah. I saw one of 'em outside. What is it with crack and transsexuals? Who? Quite a mess. How are you, Raymond? You know what I mean. I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you. What're you now, a desperado? Put the guns down. You think I'd shoot you? Come on, Jack -- don't. I'm trying not to. I just wanna know what's gonna happen. You're not dumb. I don't know. Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill. Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade. I want you to know something. I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking. I'm just going to the bathroom. No, you're right. Or Buddy. I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit. Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet. So she did help you? You were going to see her? Where? I couldn't believe it. I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. Like if we could take a time-out... You waved to me in the elevator. What were you gonna do with me? You believe that? He killed a police officer. You kept touching me, feeling my thigh. Remember how talkative you were? In the trunk? Adele said you do that when you're nervous. You really wear that suit. You like taking risks. If I remembered you. I came looking for you. I would've said sure, let's do it. But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team. Why would you trust me? If I had answered, what were you gonna say? Oh, God... Or once. Well, does it make sense to you? It's your game. I've never played this before. Not yet. Don't say anything yet. Okay? No. What do you do for a living, Gary? It smelled. I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it. I don't have a problem with it. What, as a sales rep? I'm a sales rep. I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl. Love it. No, they're all right. I meant, you just got here. Don't leave me. It takes hours to get a drink around here. There's only one waitress. Whatta you mean we'll make it an island? One last score, that the idea? Move to some island. Unless you wanna tell me. Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully? My dad's retired. He was a Private Investigator. Forty years. I used to work for him. Why not? There's a guy here on the task force right now. Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out. Let's see. You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off. Think I could have them back? How do you know? Wait-- you have my wallet. That's my dad. None of your business. How'd you get this number? Yes. Get your hands up and turn around. Now . I mean, romantically. I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick. With Robert Redford, when he was young. You have to be kidding. You'd probably tell me. Nothing. Bleeding on a country road. Peter Finch. <i>Network</i>. Yeah, she was good. Faye Dunaway. It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana. They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving. Bonnie was eating a sandwich. I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers. Did you know he didn't have his shoes on? You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow. You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do. Sure. Uh-huh. You were married? All those falls, I'm surprised you had time. What do you want me to do? Scream? I don't think it would help much. I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up. Of course I am. I don't have to. I don't rob banks. I know the difference. You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there. So basically you've spent half your life in prison. It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor. That's funny. How many was that? Why, are you famous? So, what's your name? It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway. Buddy. That's his given name? Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this. You wouldn't have time anyway. We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to. The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me. I believe it. You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me. In my bag, in the car. For your breath. You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth. If I could have a little more room. I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys. If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead. Look at it that way. Go on. But listen, Glenn. If you're lying to me... You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up. Gee, I wonder why not. But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out? Why's that? And is Foley a part of this? Ripley? You mean the wall street guy? But I thought the whole thing was your idea? What's going on, Glenn? For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for. Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going. Put your hands on the wheel. The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him. You're not? Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right? Glenn, are you trying to steal this car? Glenn, take the exit. Take the next exit. Wait. <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn? At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice. You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on. Or, if you want to play it another way... Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close. Foley's not going to make it. And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him. Do we have a gun in the car? Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice. You're Glenn Michaels. I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled. No, that's not what I'm thinking. You don't remember me, do you? Glenn? I'll send it to you at Glades. Oh... How's it going? He took the week off so we'd have time together. So far he's worked on his boat every day. Dad? Ray Nicolet. Hi, Ray. You wanted to tussle, we tussled. Just a minute. You're not my type. Flyweight. What'd you fight, middleweight? I can tell. You're a fighter? The State Theater? Where do you think I might find Maurice? What did you call it? Your dog was killed? He said he stayed with Maurice. He said he stayed here last November. No, I'm not. Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels? No. I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows. Thanks. That's not Maurice? I'm looking for Maurice. Moselle Miller? He knew what he was doing. Nobody forced him to rob banks. It's possible. Why? None I'd like to share. So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in. Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon. She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address. I didn't have time. I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did. Foley <i>kid</i>napped me. My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity. I couldn't believe it. I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles. Not at all. He's pretty laid back, confident. Hello? Was it Foley? Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break. No, he looks a lot... He doesn't even look like that. The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday. Huh. What'd I say? How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you? I really gotta go. Dad... No thanks. Serving process, a Summons and Complaint. Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights. Can we change the subject? He's about to. Technically. They're separated. He was. Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over. Can't. I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten. Thanks, Dad. --Sig-Sauer .38. I love it. It's beautiful. You fit another Chanel suit in here?I don't know. I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing. Only the stupid ones. Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets. Besides, I'm not IRA no more. You go shoot me if you want, Vincent, but you'll be dead before I hit the ground. Well I don't! I don't know. Of course. Very good. Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid. Leaving... Is that right? Coordinate all you want, but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me. Are we in sync on this, Vincent? I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness. Budweiser? You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence? That's not beer! Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss. Best beer in the world known to man or God. Some places, not all. Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg. Food's not our thing, you see. That's why you were riding with him. And you believed me? But it wasn't my people who did it. And then... Which leads us to... The deal? The deal is we leave for Nice at first light. And who are you? The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show. It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking. No, Seamus. I heard you the first time. You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head... You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix. They're good! Not yet... You lose them! That's him. They're part of the team. One of them's the guy I told you about. Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there? Not to me, you know that. So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it? And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly? When we're done with this, I want to do for that one myself. Come off it, Sam -- if we weren't friends already we wouldn't be here now, would we? Alright? It's bloody fucking freezing in here! Bloody fucking hell... Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself. And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us. I'm a patriate. Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself. I can't believe I misjudged you like I did. That we're too stupid to trace his calls. I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract. Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes. Exactly. Gregor, he was the Russian's man. It was my people came up with the idea for this run, but the Russians who had the capital to finance it. Gregor, he was their insurance, and I was ours. Everybody else was supposed to be neutral. Gregor must've got to Swede... I don't know... Well I don't! It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you. But I do know who we're working for. My people, and the Russian mob. Just business. I better be getting that. Exactly. And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me. I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to. when I was a - Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with. You know: any man who needed setting up. Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed. Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam. To most of the men I with I was always the girl. "Send the girl to do it." "Tell The girl to take care of it." "Have the girl fuck him." But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less. Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again. I probably do. But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it... Nobody's saying they don't. That's right. I still am. I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon. Could you teach me to do that? The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war... You were a soldier, were you? He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker. Don't do it, Sam! That fucking figures... Where's the case? Alright, Gregor, I'm... Next. Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we? What's your job? But would you stake your life, that's the question... You sure about this? Good, because it cost enough. There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it. From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done. You. What do you do and what should we call you? Not likely. Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning. I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it? Well I don't know -- Don't you want it? This whole place? That's great Earl! Well what do you know! An air conditioner. And what happened? You do? Are you hungry? I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent. Did they ever find out who they were? People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details. How's work? Is that the mail? I didn't know you were coming. Hi.You know I do. I don't believe it. Do you wanna tell me what that was all about? Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden... I don't know. My friends... I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else... Can you rely on how much they said you'd get? When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out? I don't know, Booth. How are we going to do all this? A satellite dish? I love you. So do I. It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us. I hate it when you talk like this. Go on. I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer. He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year. I know. It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal. He started digging through my closet, something he never does. I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it. Well, I can't let you down now, can I? And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time. Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me. Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time? He's not, he's... Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over. You got me something? What's the occasion? I'm in here. OK. I love you. Are you sure you're OK? Oh. You coming by tonight? What's wrong? It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official. Heard you had quite a night. Hi. Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours... Has he? He's irresponsible. There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue. What for? Dwayne please calm down! Dwayne - Dwayne put the gun down -- It certainly is... No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out. And do it all over again tomorrow! Whatever... Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner. Don't you want to hear about my day? Just trying to be civil Dwayne. I didn't say that. You did. That hasn't stopped you before. I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand. It was going to be a surprise! I can't hear a word you're saying! What? I don't know...How about a lift home? Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit. We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we? You don't like it? Yeah, if you're Superfly. Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that. It's called a dress. This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find �em. Jesus...what do you want? You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI! You got a lot of guts calling me. Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way. OK. Well...make us proud. And be careful. Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK? They put you in charge? With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about? What's wrong with that? No...what? The Feds?! Last night's as much my fault as yours. If he's gonna put the blame on anybody -- Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours. Where'd you get it? Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.Every word. Thomas Kent! What happened to Sam? No Juliet?! I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will. Nobody knew! You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig! Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming. From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome? A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King! He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona. But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players. No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . . All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all. I am not so well-born. But at the playhouse. Nurse? But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another? Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks. Oh, but they can! And I love poetry above all. I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed Your Majesty Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Write me well. Nor you for me. I don't know. It's a mystery But all ends well. But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?�she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke�Orsino. An excellent beginning Let him be�a duke. And your heroine? The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night. If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier. It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise. A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love. "I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day." "It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die." Will you read it for me? But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified. If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare. You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come. I love you, Will, beyond poetry. Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet. You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed. You lie. You never spoke so well of him. Will! What--? Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday. You cannot, Wessex will kill you You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go. What will you have me do? Marry you instead? Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season. Oh, but it will end well for love? That's my line! Oh, Will! Oh, do not go It is broad day! The rooster tells us so! Oh--no, no! Mr. Henslowe? It was the owl--come to bed Moonlight! You would not leave me? And that was only my first try. Even your play. I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play. I do not know how to undress a man. Then kiss me again for I am not mistook. Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare? Can you love a player? Oh, not for the world! If they find you here they will kill you. Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart. Oh but why "alas?" Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?! Who is there? He is dead? Mourning? Who is dead, my lord? It is to be expected on a Sunday. I am going to church. It is not my riding day, my lord. I mean�Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can Good morning, my lord! I will do my duty, my lord. The Queen has consented? But why me? Virginia?! I do not love you, my lord. Do you intend to marry, my lord? You flatter, my lord. Lord Wessex. You have been waiting. So my lord? I speak with him every day. My lord.Norman, please! Don't! Don't do it! Norman, don't do it! Don't pull it, Norman. It'll start a fire we can't stop. Norman? Don't do it, Norman! That's our reserve air. What was that? Where is it? What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there? But you've tested it? High Voltage? What do we use for defense? What if it attacks? What was that? Nice work, Captain sir. I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it. But she's -- Forgive me. I've never read the Navy manual. I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures. Yeah. I heard you. Two and a half days? How long will that be? Norman! I am not leaving without him. Do you hear me? We come down as a team, we leave as a team. Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts. How about I just press the button? Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up? Hold on -- Would you wait a minute? Wait a minute -- There's heat coming the door. In basic English, what does all this mean? How big is this spacecraft? How's that? Would it work? Get away -- Get away from me! You hear that? What is that? What are you doing? Top shelf, is it? Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth can get you? Some more chicken, perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge. Don't tell me about me. I already know too much. Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now. You can't stop it, Norman. You can't fight me. Leave me alone, Norman. It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it. From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it. Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not me. Don't you know? You're frightened, aren't you, Norman? I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself. Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else. You want to blame Beth. Because you hate Beth. This is what I'm talking about, Norman. Don't you see? It's in you. This vindictiveness. This rage. You think I care? You think I care if I die? Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself? Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time? I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you. Your safety. Protecting you from your own self. It's your choice. Because it's not safe for you to be awake. To be walking around. To be thinking about things. It's either this... or I kill you. You think I'd belive you? Believe anything you might say now? After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past. About my problems. My problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine. Promise what, Norman? Tell me! But I have to, Norman. "It's not me, Beth. It's not me. It can't be. I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle. I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you? When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? Do you know? "I can't get Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears? You never really saw what it was, did you? No, it isn't. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name? The one who was stung when you were younger. The one that died. The one you couldn't save. What was his name? "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman. I'm scared." "C'mon, Harry , it'll be fine, it'll be fun." You heartless fuck. That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it? Is it? You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened? That's right. But you can't remember going inside, can you? No, of course not. Harry couldn't either, could he? "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said. You don't remember you did. But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you? You remember that. Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane? Did I? Or was that you? When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you? Terrified. Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. You did that, Norman. One lonely, terrifying sea snake. And the snakes? You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn't you? When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified. Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure I'm lying? Then explain to me about the jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see jellyfish? Harry doesn't fear jellyfish. You do. They're your fear, aren't they? C'mon -- what? Yes, someone did. But it wasn't me, Norman. It was you. You manifested the snakes. You think I manifested the snakes? No, he can't. No, he isn't. Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself. What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"? If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I? Don't you? You tell me. Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good. Snakes? What do you mean, exactly? I did do that, didn't I? You don't think I put something in it, do you? It's getting cold. Are you? What's wrong, Norman? Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot. What was that? I couldn't hear you. How's Harry? What do you mean, different? In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why? What is it, Norman? You're not sorry. You're scared. You're a psychologist, Norman. You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth. And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore. For what? Only lab rats. Here. You ever given an injection before. Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place. To be on the safe side. I mean -- It's an idea. What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour? And he can fight it off? We can't afford that. How fast does it take effect? I'll just boost the doses. How long does it last? "... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... " Causes sleep. It's a soporific. How do you spell it? Antibiotic. Antihistamine. For bites. "... and may also cause bizarre halucinations". Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness. Nothing about drowsiness. A synthetic opium analogue. Ulcers. It's for motion sickness. Something for burns. Why would Harry go back to using a code? And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested. His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you? But why is he doing it? Which I told Barnes was attacking -- How can the sphere do that? But how? You think, in the sphere -- What do you mean, a part of Harry? What? Manifested? Squids? What? Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't you get it? There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it. Why can't you believe me? You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't? Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up. You don't believe me. No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier. He must've hid it. None of this was here before. Wait a second -- That wasn't in there before. The refridgerator. Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that? What's Harry doing with your suit in there? You get it straightened out? Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me. Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad. ... what do you mean? I'm in the ship. Still clear. You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time. Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous. What's the matter? Still clear. The sub's a 100 feet in front of you. You see it? You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman... You don't trust me? I fixed your suit. I don't trust Harry to do it. You should know how it works. Just in case. Maybe you should go. To the sub. Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle. We can't. The storm. The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. And we have four days of decompression when we get up top. You, me and Harry. He's asleep. It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people. And there's only three of us left now. Don't bother me, Norman. I have to reset the sub. No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm. Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman. You bastard. You did, didn't you? You told him about me? You said something to him, didn't you? Don't tell me to calm down! He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon. In Edmunds' things. "Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft. Signed, Barnes, USN." Fuck you, Norman! It's right here... So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody. Yeah, he told you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out. ... He lied to us. He left us down here. Eggs. Norman. She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mean... Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that? What?... Wait. Don't... why are you -- I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they -- What? Why... Yeah, why? What? They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach. Normally, I'd say no. Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity. Makes sense. But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish. What about you? What happened to you? My gosh, Norman. A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this. The library. It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas. Norman! Good theory, Ted. Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless. You're next, Norman. Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson? Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that? Don't jeopardize this. Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this? Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography. What do you expect? For them to bring it up here? To the spacecraft. To investigate. Because when we get down there -- Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you listening? Don't tell anyone what you just told me. That's quite a secret. I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant. I love secrets. Who says it's a he? Norman? Where's Norman? I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts. I don't get it. Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine. What's that -- mistake number two, Norman? We can refuse to talk. No I'm not. I'm not star-- Like what? I'm not -- Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack. What? Just in time, too. I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue. Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't I? Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there -- Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that. When he woke up, he said we were out of food. He told me to get some from the ship. Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty... What are you looking for? Then what is it? It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this? For whoever's in that thing. All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.They never used to send a Navy car. Was it a military crash? There's a U.S. Navy car outside, Norman. How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus? Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume. Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment -- In the closet. I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you? There's nothing on the news about a crash. Did he say what airline? What kind of a crash was it?She's dying and Rache is your mother now! So what's up? Who's marrying who this time? Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol... Ben! What's wrong? I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me! I can put myself to bed. I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk. I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie! I'll miss you so much. Yes. Until he's old enough to read. I'm not. I don't want to say goodbye. And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh? You cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on Earth !! Mom? What's wrong? Maybe twenty. This'll work, huh? This is a joke, right? I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame. Not with my mouth open. ...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some really clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings. Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen ... Great. A debate. Man's inhumanity to woman. He's pro women. I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted. She is only the Princess of Cool. Mommy is the Queen! He wouldn't know. I saw her in the shower! I said... THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON! Where's Rache? It's Thursday , we get to be with Rache ! You lied. If you lied then , maybe you're lying now . I can never belive you again ! And don't tell her I told you. Actually. She's kind of cool, when you get to know her. She knows every neat junk food place. ...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself. Are you kidding ? It is so much better than the one Rachel showed me! Wow. Who's that for? I'll be there for you. Like how? No I'm not. I don't care. Why should I care? I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced. Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother. Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh... Or blush. You look pale. But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates... Then why are you putting on mascara? What are you gonna talk about? I like talking about it. At least, to you. Because it feels really incredibly good. Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh... I live. In the same country. During sex. Why does Rachel scream? Sex. Of course. I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen... I'm gonna call him. Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now. What happens when he loves Rachel more than us? It just slipped out. Like who? I'm not upset. Why would I be upset? Mass hysteria. I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen? I didn't say that. Why would I say that? I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up. I hate when you say that. I don't care. But Rache... In high school. Uh. What is it? No. But they stand out, a little. Like this. Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not. Not use my words, please! And Mom says anger never, never solves anything. It makes every- thing worse . No, his mother's always on time. I did what she said. I used my words, I told him what I felt , and they... IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT !! Suits me fine ! You're just a stepmother . So stop bossing , cos nobody's listening ! You think this is funny? That doesn't bother me. Annabelle pick up the phone. Why don't you say hello? Here's weak ...Mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and Brad's parents !! Can you believe the humiliation ??? You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now ? In front of the whole world ? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!! I killed my math quiz, A-minus. It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm way too young. It's just for play. MOMMY! Now could she just... forget me! What if he's kidnapped? I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up. But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven! Just where I wanna be all Saturd... And this is my room so get out! This is my daddy's house -- I don't have to listen to you! You're not my mother. Don't touch me! I'm allergic to you! You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did you remember my egg carton? I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today. I'm gonna beep daddy at work. Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch. No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter. You lost Ben?! You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today. Cos she loves you. There's worse things. YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, TOO ? You owe me a quarter. No they're not. Don't take my picture! I hate her. I really hate her. Ice cold water.Good. That's very good. Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad. Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going. Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until he's old enough to not open them all at once. Let me be the judge of that. Thank God. I got to see you. Grown up. Don't. Take me with you. No, that never solves anything. You talk like the big girl you are. About what you feel. And how he's hurt you. You know? You tell the truth. I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk... Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem? And I think it's time we move to Plan B... Nothing sweetheart. Annabelle...wake up honey... How many devilled eggs can you eat? Oh, yeh. He's not even there. You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys. You have to ignore him. And what do you do wh... Good girl. You wouldn't kiss him, huh? You don't like his friends. Actually. I could only help him. I could help with the debate. What's Thursd... She is but an arriviste. And...? ...I'm not deaf, y'know. I can't hear you. We make mistakes. And we forgive each other. Because we love each other, very m... I know how scared I get when you're sick. So I waited to tell you. Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr... Secret's safe with me. I bet. Like a big sister. I hope it's the right kind. Well. It's for you. That happens. To families. Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us. But we do have a choice. To make it better. Instead of worse. Daddy and I tried hard. We really did. Look she's upset -- Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara... I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up. Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual... Because it's quiet. And he wants to talk. Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime... So why are you asking me? ...why do you think? How would you know sh... Scream. Well, not exactly s... Daddy was washing Rachel. In the shower. What did you think that was about? Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values. Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always. You can call him after dinner but... That will never happen. It happens. Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty. Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face. You wind up looking like... Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in. Well you're telling your teachers and your friends -- Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen. Excellent point. Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. Terrible name for a planet. Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. Use your words. I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family. ...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple. No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we? Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in here . You'll know. What I'm saying. Right here. Right here. Inside the magician. Shhhh. The world. Thinks I'm gone. But only the magician. Knows better. Half. Of him. If a soldier loses his legs in a war. Is he the same guy? Sure he is. So what do you think we're gonna talk about? Well, don't make him disappear before I see him. Find the bird cage? I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie. And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar... Okay. These are good. Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day. Ben. God doesn't like visitors. Ben where do you have to get to? Where Ben? Ben! Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing! Ben listen to me... Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born. In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight... I'm still sick, but I'm better. Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds. Hers was very bad. I have cancer. Do you know what that is? Mommy's sick, guys. Pray. We never find out. ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IN THERE!!! Thursday's fine... I'm fine, ba... That I do. Always will. Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup. Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what. I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what? Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller. You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden. Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti. What honey? Yes...if you like big hair... People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money. Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don't get paid. No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job. Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright? Thank you Ben. Annabelle! Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it. Lava's hateable. I never thought of that. I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. Hate . I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches? Why would his worry? Or my children's worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the sit... I have to get dressed. My ex-husband has asked me to dinner. God knows why, he was very mysteri... That's necessary, huh? So we'll...radiate some more? People beat it, don't they? All the time. I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller. I live or I die. Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'. I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you. Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him? Boy, kids go wild for that. Never stand between that kid and a meatball. It's temporary. Stop. You're making me insecure. And we all went through that together? The great thing about life is that things keep changing. No. You think this is going to help the kids then you do it. You're on your own. WE are over. You can't be an 'us' just when you want to. You can't play that card when it's convenient. To make it easier for them or you? Just not to me. Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago? The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting. Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it. And I'm supposed to care. Slugs . Have faster learning curves. Trees , even. You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war. But I'm doing this for their well-being. Called him. We set an ap... We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke? I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer. Not to me. Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been... ...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her? At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know. I said I'd get 'em back tonight... Just outside the big top, we're almo... Easy enough. Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend... ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. I'm worried. You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes... It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her. Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up -- They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father. We're not discussing your age. Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- Something's up wi... Because you don't really seem here. Are you here? Remarried. There is no move. Just sit me up. Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first. Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes. I have their past. You'll learn. You're the hip and fresh. What do I have that you don't? Why didn't I? He only remembers I found him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you. I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you. I lost him. I was panicked. Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back? Is scary. But you want it. Gimme some truth here. No, there isn't. What's this about? Because we fought ? She likes a Stolie, no ice. Thanks for coming out. You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back. And there will come another moment. When the stakes are really there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was. Well, that's what parenting is about , little girl. They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her. Doing the right thing. Knowing who you are , inside. Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course... Shut the fuck up. I didn't go behind your back. See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some real growth. Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'. You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think I couldn't figure out some low blows? You taught my child that I am some limp dick loser . Who didn't care about her pain. So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck. You had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model ! You put filth in my child's mouth. You are defending what you did? Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother. Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b... Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'? And I'm going to win. Now we're going to have a fight, you and I. He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad? Who in the world is he? Is that what he told you? Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world. Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. He loves to hear that story, over and over. How he was born a magician. Feeling the pressure? That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy. I know you, huh? The car pools, he measles, the PTA. It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. You have to think long term. Yes. I made the choice that was right for me. And I don't regret it. But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible. And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough. Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge. You mean, after I'm dead? Do what you've worked your whole life to do? I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out? ...go to the park. In the worst way. It's covered , okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her? Thanks, but it's under control. How's she doing with Brad? Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there? What else? Keep on keepin' on. He's relentless. A major asshole. The primo stuff is great for pain. You try to center on the big issues, y'know. What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the really big issues keep swamping y... Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there. I really look like shit. It's promising, this one. We're upbeat. It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back. And you said...? She's devastated. Oh, my God. ...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once. Moi? She hasn't mentioned this. You're a cross-dresser. Small world. Ironic, huh? I have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years ! They came out of my body ! You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth . Who I have loved from my heart for twelve years ! How would you know anything ? How the hell would you know? Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope. Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups? Then let him talks to me. We don't need you to solve our prob... Did I hear the word... Bi-coastal parenting. Happens every day. Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and... Nobody likes a snoop. Don't flatter yourself. You WHAT? My boss. I don't know wh... Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay? ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight. ...thinking of going back to Random House. On a part-time basis. Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know. Yes? She was angry at herself. Anxiety. Hey. At least it's not an editing machine. It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there. Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish? Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...? Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms... Fine, forget it. However many. It's not enough. I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park. So why did y... Those are my children you're practicing on. They deserve first- rate care. Every minute. Of every night. And every day. You're not terribly good at taking care of h... I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite... I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but... A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children! Ever again ! Do you HEAR that? I am not here to make it easier for you. These are my children. They don't want to be with you. You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children. Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. Think twice. Before you ever pull that again. Of all the cheap excuses. To break a child's heart. Machines do not EAT message. You got to hell! Get out! Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother. You mean for you. A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out. Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards? I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers. ...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own. But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with... What did you do? What happened with Annabelle? Has nothing I said gotten through to you? Annabelle, how's your video rep... We don't have any coffee. Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't you have a mother? How do you hold down a job? It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.A suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on Monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an escort service! The guy I see is in the eighth grade at Prep School, and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you. He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you walk away, then whip around... Oh. It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to. But it's real. Does he have an older brother? Great. Big ears, too? Help me here... No, baby. You're gonna use my words. And you don't tell her. What you're going to say. That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be. Now, just this once... Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking heart out! ...laughed, yeh. They laughed real hard. Oh, baby, I'm so sor... June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad. And then I will be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th... No. I think it's ugly. You think this is funny? That doesn't bother me. Annabelle pick up the phone. Annabelle, I know you miss your mother. So why don't you say hello. Honey, she won't d... That's so weak. She still packing for her trip? See, I... Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency? And she called me. And we switched days. Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and... C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom... He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN? GODDAMMIT! Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom? It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon. Hold lunch! The timing was off -- I need this light. This is my house too! What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom. You don't need another one. But when you're at this house -- Thank God for that! I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi... Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything. He's badgering a witness. Eat. I'm almost done making it. Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH! Here. Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!! I didn't forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That's your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother. IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP. 'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man... Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad... How could I be? We learned some magic... That's nice Ben. &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; &quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben! Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad. &quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot; Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams. Annabelle let's get something clear. ...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat -- We are late. We are seriously late. Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed -- Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door... Ben! Knock it off! It's gonna go beautifully... Damn it Ben -- Alright starve. Then have a donut -- Fine. Fine! Eat in the cupboard. Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're late. You're really late. Now get out here and have some cereal. Sure. I was just doin' my nails. And when did that pass? You say that like I don't know that. Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow... No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep , not a job that's hard to lose , can't be both. Duncan. I've got an even better idea... They're losing one mother. They can't lose two. Which part of no don't you understand? I've got it. It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th... It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab... Duncan. My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again. Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing -- You know, there's nothing you have to say. Because they know your heart. You don't have t... Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds. You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know. You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you , every moment... You ride with Annabelle... Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate... With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is. Uh. You hate my guts? Ben never mentioned it. You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds , you could find him from a coma , there is no WAY! You're lying. Maybe I was wrong on that one. Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh? You die young, you always look golden. Perfect. The memory kind of burnishes the image, and... I never wanted to be a mom. Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life... And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it. I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love... Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line. Double. Neutral ground. What's up? That's what it is. And that's all it is. And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done. She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering yours . Oh please. You weren't passing 'em out. That's not wh... She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni... Worked. Like a charm. Aw. Right down to the ground. Let's get to it. Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA? Give 'em my number. It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h... Don't be too sure. Are we. Looks nice enough to m... You really didn't have to come, you know. I'd have brought them straight t... He won't discuss it. Just calls it history. That thing you said before. Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood... And her...? My advice to you? Don't die. I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or... It's the same choice you made. Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n... It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others. It's just not the right time t... No. Hon, maybe your mom would like t... Yah? Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever. Needs to know when to find a Plan B. Cos Plan A is not and will n... Can I say one thing? I mean, the last thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b... Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti... And you said... I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.' Brad Kovitsky. You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough. So. Hopeful. Can I look at the pictures? Beats me. Ask your mom. Doesn't begin to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, this is serious. Right. Which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date. Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.' As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually go to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're... Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks. She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it. That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky. So I have to tell you something in confidence... Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes. Okay, I'm undeserving. See, I know that. And cigarettes. I smoke, too. I don't, but... You bet you are. You're not dying. I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too. ...it's my problem, too. Luke. Can't live like that. We can't live like that. But I came here to... And I know checking into your life was inexcusable... Look, you've never liked me... You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco. You're not working at Random House, I talked to them. I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets. And the note. From your new boss. Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki... Hey, any help you need, we'll cover. Wowie. How wonderful! You feeling all right? When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you... Jackie? Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell -- What about obsessively picking her split ends? No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens... I'm sorry, I just... Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's. Not personally. Why not just bring the whole toilet? I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me. What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors? I did it for her. I need practice. She already hates me. You've seen to that. I didn't do it for you. Believe me. I have a snoop. I don't recall inviting you. ...in. Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y... Jackie, if I thought for one moment... I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration. I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb... Yeh? Look, I... But it's not on the schedule! Maybe the problem is your kids . Maybe they're spoiled, coddled brats ! You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead! I have a life! No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her -- I was in there in him. Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking. Forgiveness? For what , exactly? She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only... Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you... Maybe you could back off just a little bit -- What is this? The Betty Ford Center? Can I please have a cup of coffee? This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here... I'm gonna get me a drink. How about the promises we make to our kids? About their future. Do we shrug those off, just that easily? Because you've changed so much. 'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?' No, here's ugly. 'I love you , babe. It's just our life together I'm not so sure about...' No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman. Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...' By way of saying you were unhappy. Let me put it this way. Hell, no. What do you call it? You told her you had doubts. ...while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer. But she said... You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another. Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner? Just like to make sure. That your past. And my future. Are real different. Hold your applause. We're not having fun, here. No problem. I know that. Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish? Are you hungry? You could make us something? It's just an assignment. It's no biggie. What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think. Everything's gonna work out. The kids and I...we're going to love each other. Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing? I think so too... Oh my God. Are you serious? You haven't done one goddam thing to make any of this easier... Why are you taking this out on him ? Our weekend. At that sweet little B &amp; B. Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo... Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again. You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it -- I just don't get it. Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand... Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes. And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work -- Look. I know they hate me. I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman. But? But what? You don't trust me to be alone with them. Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't. I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around -- For what? Jesus. So I'll have to order in? You'd rather spoil our walk home. Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve haff to ta... The way you cook. If you could make love, I'd marry you. Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it! Boiling down half a ton of bones... Okay, if they're going to have a sauce, put something in it besides flour and chicken broth... Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three... No. I'm doing it behind her back. Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.--Truman, you're gonna be late! Truman, stop it! You're the one talking to the walls! Do something... You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening. I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best. Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners-- That's not true. Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well. So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this. So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans? Truman, what about that sign? Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath! There's been an accident, Truman. Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own! Truman, that was our house! You blaming me for the traffic? Truman, I think I'm going to throw up. So why do you want to go? You hate gambling. What?! You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it? --we need more charcoal. I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me-- Put some butter on it--or ice? I don't know-- Oh, my God! Surgery. The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night. Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors. Non-union contractors. Monsters. We're starting with an amputation. I'm sorry, I'm late. See you in a minute, sweetheart. I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while? Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough? I made macaroni. Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that. I know. What're you doing down here? This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed. I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure? We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations? And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager. Every time you and Marlon-- Oh, God. Where have you been? Did something happen today? I was hoping we could have a special evening. A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on. Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe. Well, what do you think? It's a surprise. Truman, you're gonna be late!Because his mother got sick - very sick. He couldn't leave her. He's a kind boy, maybe too kind. Shhh! They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory. Things always do--when you look back. Hold on a minute, dear. Here's us at Mount Rushmore. You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive. You slept all the way there. You know he was an only child, like you. I know how bad you feel about what happened--sailing into that storm. But I don't blame you, Truman. I never have. --Darling-- About time they started cleaning up the trash Downtown. We don't want to end up like the rest of the country. It doesn't sound insane, Truman. I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces. I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday. I feel certain my condition runs in the family. Can't this wait, dear? You look very pale, Truman. Are you taking your vitamin D's? You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear. Oh, just so. Well, I made it through another night.Well, we're FBI agents. I think you better tell us. You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? Do you live around here? No, they don't. What is it you find incredible? Agent Mulder. I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence -- Nothing completely conclusive -- Yes. I know. That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained -- Yes. I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me -- I can't go any farther. Where are we? Cold... I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance. No -- it's -- ...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat. Something's wrong... I'm having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. My... motor functions are being affected. I'm... I think... something stung me. Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down. You don't Mulder -- you've never needed me. I've only held you back. I've got to go. I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers -- I have. I did. It's done. You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me -- I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew -- I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation. Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately. Where'd they go? What are you doing? Yeah...? I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe. Cool in here. Temperature's being regulated. Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert? This is weird, Mulder. What do you think it is? Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end -- I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this. Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder. Mulder -- What do you mean by haul? What are you not telling me here? They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks. -- of what exactly?! I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks. This is great. This is fitting. I don't know why I think they went right. We've got two choices. One of them is wrong. About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction. That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them. I don't know, Mulder. All the equipment is brand new. It looks pretty green for this climate. No. It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests -- The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it. I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain. He didn't mention a park. That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat. Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now. The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body. I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen. Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here -- I've got a hearing tomorrow -- Mulder -- I don't know. Evidence of a massive infection. I can't really talk right now. Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here. I'm in serious violation of medical ethics. You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what? You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here. I don't know what killed this man. I'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either. And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam. There's some kind of cellular breakdown. It's completely edematous. And you're looking for? This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? Mulder -- what are you doing? Go home, Mulder. It's late. I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting. Is that before or after you got the idea to come here? Are you drunk, Mulder? No. There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore. Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too. They're not doing this, Mulder. I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done. Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that. I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993. I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment... They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up. All I told them was the truth. -- Mulder! Get in the car! Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it. Hang on. I'm gonna get you out of there. Mulder? Tell me this is a joke. Nice try, Mulder. Where are you, Mulder? Scully... Something sweet. I just did. You're buying. I saw your face, Mulder. There was a moment of panic. Oh yeah. Had you big time. Had you. Now what? You've got to quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed the X-Files. There's procedure to be followed here. Protocol. I know you're bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now. Jesus, Mulder... Mulder...? Mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. If we don't act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. Lives could be lost -- I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street. I've just climbed twelve floors. I'm hot and thirsty and I'm wondering, to be honest, what I'm doing here. No. I haven't. I'm on the roof. Mulder -- it's me --Tomorrow. We are getting married tomorrow. So where's that leave us? Well, oh... What does that mean? Money? My god. Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?! You put him down or don't bother coming back. If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over. You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too. Move the bodies. The only proof is those bodies. Like how? What does that mean? I told Boyd two fucking minutes! No buts. I've waited twenty-seven years, twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle. I will not be derailed! I will not be embarrassed! I will not be denied! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell or high fucking water! No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses. Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned. You left a dead prostitute out in the desert? Alone? My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she? Call the police. You killed a prostitute. You fucked a prostitute? Who's dead? What are you talking about? What kind of stupid question is that? What? Don't even. Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay. It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama. No. Yeah. You. I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow. I won't even discuss it. We're not canceling. Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got... No way. Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?! Are they fighting? Now? Well, can you come back inside? After the wedding, which we're paying for ourselves, and this house... "At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..." Then you'd better work on it in the car. We gotta go see the Judge. What's the word on the chairs? You sound funny. Did you do cocaine? The chairs. What okay? What about the chairs? How late? Where are you? Hello. Go have fun. Not too much. Yeah. Nesting. Just a bit of organizing. Well you should. That's sweet. Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation? Hi. Are you calling from jail? Hello. Have a nice bachelor party. Just call and let me know that your okay. Do you love me? Will you please call the chair people? Maybe. Take care of those chairs. Do you love me? I need your help. I need your help. Go down to the seat place and straighten this out. You go down there. Not padded ones. We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded. Keith do not trivialize this. Seating problems. We've got problems here. Kiss me...? How much? Do you love me? I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?! I've seen it on television. It's vile! You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them. He's weird. And I expect more from you. Why? What's his problem? He's weird. He's weird. I just don't see him in the big picture. It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here. Charles Moore for instants. I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships... I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself. Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality? David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas. He's a moron. I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this. Right before the wedding? Well it's bad timing. It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas. I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes. I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks. You know how important this is to my mother. You know that. Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't... Don't you dare. I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith. What else have you forgot? You can't play around with these tent people. Why did you forget the tent check? Why? You forgot the tent? Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge... Caterer? Florist? Photographer? The wedding cake check? What do you mean, you think so? Did you send in all of the deposit checks? Why is this Kid staring at me? Can't we do it on the phone? Why can't we do it through the mail? This is ridiculous. I do. You know, Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me. Honey, sing it for Judge Tower. "You Send Me." We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic. We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out. I kind of like "till death do us part." I mean, this is forever. In sickness and in health, through good times and bad. Honey, what do you think? A mutant species. The stone age. ...embarrassing, shameful... That's our plan. We will. We're in no hurry. I think we'll take some time to enjoy each other, enjoy our freedom before we surrender ourselves to kids. I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.I'm fine. Nice TV. So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half- sisters. Suzie. Then you're not her grandmother... And the child... Was there ever any kind of investigation... She still work there? Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway? Try, Kelly. You mean he withdrew... Then what? Did you try to fight him? He was large? That's okay, Kelly. You're doing fine. But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt. Was this the first time a man was inside you? Was there penetration? Did he put himself inside you? I understand. Take your time. I know you do. How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute? Suzie? You could tell me where you were last night. Ray thinks she was murdered. She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket. Suzie Toller is missing. Weren't you a little worried about her...? Did you call anyone? Did you call her house to see if she got home? Did you call the Masons? And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car? I'd like that. It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it. I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track... He's leaving the country. And I don't give a shit. I'm tired, Ray. I'm going home. And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up? Ray, you heard him... We don't know that, Ray... Her grandmother said she'd been threatening to run away. And I found the car at the Miami bus terminal. Where's the body? Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth. If you want company... You have someplace to be? Ray. We don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere... We all have... You could say that. Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life. Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway? Eliminate the competition. This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it? So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father... Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing... Unless what? Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial. Lombardo's settlement? That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile. It's a pretty dismal place. You mean Camp Sixty-Nine. The skinny brunette. You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark. You know what you get? More bark. And more bark. There's no core. Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water. And now they can't get rid of them. They've tried poisons. Nothing works. They don't die. All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van Ryan push us too hard, we're going to wind up looking stupid. We failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw Kelly go into the house, so he can't say how long she was in there. Same with the kids. They saw her running down the street, but that's it. With no physical evidence, what do we have? Her word against his. Same as him. They saw her come. They saw her go. They saw him follow. Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do. We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary. All I'm saying is, I think we should go slow here. Back to the land of grownups. What was that? At that point were you able to fight him off? Did he come in with you? So you were alone. And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there? He dropped Jimmy off first? We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride? Why is that? That bothers you? You know what that will mean for Lombardo. I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years. We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers. That doesn't make him a child rapist. There's something else. This girl's had some problems. Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars. Ran away... I think she's acting. I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her. I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...I know one thing he said. It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up. He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that. He said, "No little girl can ever make me come." Not at first. He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything... He said we had this secret. And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that. I don't know. It's hard to remember, exactly. He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen." Then he just stopped. I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.' No. I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated. But this hurt... like, he was built... you know... Yes. I said stop. I screamed. I mean that's how it sounded in my head. He hurt me... He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something. I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor. They were in me. Both places... you know. The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind. His fingers... his fingers... I just want to get it over with. My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it. Shit. I think we just need to get wasted. Nothing. Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain? Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp... Oh, for Christ's sake. You can trust me. I can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you? Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit. Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him. Get off my property. Police -- God -- get a life. You're out of your mind. Excuse me? About what? How to improve your breast stroke? Is there some reason why you're here? A friend of mine bought a boat. Don't bother. I'm taking a trip. You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me... Yes. God, Mom... I was raped. By Sam Lombardo. No you don't. I miss Dad. No thanks to you. My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash. You notice my new jumper? Which one of your "bodyguards" is that? Hi, Mon. Um-huh. And guess what else? I have toys. I'm running away. No little girl can ever make me come. Say you love me. That never seemed to worry you at the Glades. Okay. I love you too. But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber... I don't know. I want to see you... I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit... I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something... I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me. God, I've been calling you. Hello? There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb... I'm here. You know what it takes. Why can't you come... Yes. Stick? Do it to ourselves? Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party. Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom. How much? So you got my mom's money. Drop dead... You know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? She's trying to break my trust. How do you like that? I can't touch it until she's dead and she won't give me a dime and now she's trying to break it to pay you... Mr. Lombardo. We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons? You could give me a ride when you find the ticket. Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo. Aren't you forgetting something? Your coupon. We gotta have it. Where's the hose? We can set up. Look, he forgot. I knew it. Don't forget the car wash. Deal. You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?He said, "No little bitch can ever make me come." He did say something. No. He stopped by himself. Okay? That's all. Let me go. I guess. Yes. No. Yeah. About a year ago. You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news. Yeah, maybe, a little. He was my friend at first. Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me. I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares? You wanna know something? When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette. Now they're gonna get screwed. This wasn't my idea. I said he did. Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen. And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp. He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt. Okay! He did. He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me. Now, can I go home? Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway... I wanna go home now. Yeah... okay... he did I wanna live at the beach someday. I thought we were goin' to a movie. What are you looking at? What brain? You are. You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you? I'm scared, that's what. I'm scared there's no one to trust. Man, I wanna smoke a joint. Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me... Hey, Ray. Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's? Shoulda, coulda, woulda... Get him in the water. Davy. Shut up. Get away from me. I don't mean who you're thinking. I have other friends... I don't have to listen to this. And you can't shove me around. I have friends now... Is this supposed to mean something to me? What triangle? About what? That's cop bullshit. You got something against cigarettes? Then he'll be back at Blue Balls? Will they? It's Celine. He's okay. He had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are. I did. At Blue Balls. Walter. He's been aimin' that Brownie through knotholes for years. I saw these, I knew he'd finally struck gold. I can't decide which came out better, that little straw Kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you've got up her ass. What do you think, Mr. Lombardo? Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo charm, not that you'd have to do anything you haven't done already. I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it. What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back? Trust me, the guy's dirty. He'll like it. Especially the part about offing me. Now get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend. Seems to like some of the same places you do. Funny you never met. Fuck the winch. I wanna drive. What? But then it is better this way, don't you think? No loose ends. The guy was history when he killed Kelly. You knew that. Are you mad at me? Yeah, right. But I.. Sam... How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
