They do not! I hope so. Let's go. Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie. I'm kidding. You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"? And you don't know how to quit? Like my fear of wearing pastels? What good stuff? Me. This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself. do you listen to this crap? Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210." But Well, no... I was? Tons You know Chastity? Hi. Who knows? All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes. Lesbian? No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't. Not unless my sister goes. Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment. You're sweet. I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date? Where? How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing? Forget French. I don't want to know how to say that though. I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are. How much does champagne cost? Stuff like Chat. I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone. C'esc ma tete. This is my head Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... Unsolved mystery. She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser. My sister. I can't date until she does. No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- You're asking me out. That's so cute. What's your name again? Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part. Please. Can we make this quick? Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad. Again. I did. I have to be home in twenty minutes. Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know? Combination. I don't know -- I thought he'd be different. More of a gentleman... He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation. Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron? Joey. Where did he go? He was just here. You might wanna think about it Did you change your hair? You know the deal. I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go -- Hi, Joey. Neat... Queen Harry? Hopefully. Expensive? Patrick -- is that- a. Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me? No! I just wanted I just wanted -- Let go! You looked beautiful last night, you know. I guess I'll never know, will I? God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes. No. you didn't! If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage. Why didn't you tell me? But You did what? As in... But you hate Joey Why? What? I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t. Like you care. I don't get you. You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here. I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now. You are so completely unbalanced. Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend. I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too. Like I'm supposed to know what that even means. Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched? Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that. You're ruining my life' Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal. I think you're a freak. I think you do this to torture me. And I think you suck. Oh, I thought you might have a date I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night? Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal? Can you at least start wearing a bra? Nowhere... Hi, Daddy. I have a date, Daddy. And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know. Fine. I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house. I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession! He's not a "hot rod". Whatever that is. No, but Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night -- Why? Daddy, no! It's just a party. Daddy. Daddy, people expect me to be there! It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going -- If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends. Daddy, I -- But she doesn't want to date. But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy! What if she never starts dating? Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...Perm? It's just you. What? To completely damage me? To send me to therapy forever? What? You set me up. So did you Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to. I guess I thought I was protecting you. That's not I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him. After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it. And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display -- Just once. Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore. I wasn't ready. He got pissed. Then he broke up with me. He said everyone was doing it. So I did it. Now I do. Back then, was a different story. He was, like, a total babe In 9th. For a month Joey never told you we went out, did he? I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s . Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School. You're welcome. Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- Can we go now? It's Shakespeare. Maybe you've heard of him? At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig. What's normal? What do you think? It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going. I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. Where've you been? Leave my sister alone. Away. Hey -- do you mind? Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow. Tough break. Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations. Who? You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective. We're making a statement. Listen to you! You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica. Can you even imagine? Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess? I got drunk. I puked. I got rejected. It was big fun. I did Bianca a favor and it backfired. I didn't have a choice. Who cares? No fear. If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious. Don't forget your tiara." I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. Do you mind? Neither has his heterosexuality. William didn't even go to high school So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. The people at this school are so incredibly foul. I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions. You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy. What's this? Mandella, eat. Starving yourself is a very slow way to die. Block E? I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting. Patrick Verona Random skid. Oh, Bianca? Can you get me my freshman yearbook? Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill? Is that right? A Fender Strat. You bought this? Really? What was it like? A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me? You were paid to take me out! By -- the one person I truly hate. I knew it was a set-up! That ' s completely adorable! What? Look, I'm -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives. I was wrong. It's just something I had. You know How'd you get a tux at the last minute? Answer the question, Patrick You tell me. Create a little drama? Start a new rumor? What? Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition. No, I won't go with you No. Is that a request or a command? You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that? What? No -- something real. Something no one else knows. Tell me something true. I know the porn career's a lie. The duck? State trooper? For. . . ? How? Something like that I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change. Acting the way we do. Yeah, well, don't let it get out I dazzled him with my wit Good call. The Partridge Family? You want me to climb up and show you how to get down? Put your right foot there -- C'mon. It's not that bad He left! I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me. Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing. Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties. Unwelcome. You 're so -- What are you doing here? BIANCA He just wants me to be someone I'm not. Oh, so now you think you know me? My father wouldn't approve of that that This. I should do this. Why'd you lie? No, you weren't Were you in jail? When you were gone last year -- where were you? But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them. I saw you there. What? You know what they say Hey man. . . You don ' t think I can be "cool"? You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else? I hate him. Who? Just let me sit down. Like you could find one Why? You don't care if I die Why 're you doing this? This is so patronizing. I know, just let me sleep I just need to lie down for awhile I'm fine. I'm Funny, you're the only one "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party? You know who The Raincoats are? That's what you want, isn't it? Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy. Hi Are you following me? You -- covered in my vomit. And why would I do that? I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion. Like where? The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? Oh, right. Friday. My mission in life. Sweating like a pig, actually. And yourself? When I go? What's the matter? Upset that I rubbed off on her? The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy. Parts of it. No, Daddy. Yeah. She left with some bikers Big ones. Full of sperm. I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices. I want -- So what I want doesn't matter? Because you're making decisions for me. I thought you were punishing me. Then tell them I had a seizure. This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips? You decided. I know. Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now? Or do I have some time to think about it? Tempestuous? I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls. I was merely a spectator. Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.William - he asked me to meet him here. Have you seen him? Oh, good. Something new and different for us. Okay, okay, we won't go. It's not like I have a dress anyway Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates . You didn't You didn't have a choice? Where's Kat and what have you done with her? You went to the party? I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity. What'd he say? You think this'll work? Does it matter? That's never been proven William would never have gone to a state school. You could always go with me. I'm sure William has some friends. But imagine the things he'd say during sex. An attempted slit. Just a little. He always look so That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies. Who's that? Yeah... Right. You think? Yeah. I guess. Hi.Just smack her now. No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often. The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ... Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild. By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested. Katarina Stratford. My, my. You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again. You're completely demented. You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? I'm at a loss, then. What should we talk about? Your year of absence? I don't understand, Patrick. You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? With the teeth of your zipper? It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.She died in her sleep three days ago. It was in the paper... Tom... she's dead. What? Who are you calling? What was I supposed to think happened to you?! You're killing me... Look where we are. Look at yourself. You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through... You should have. No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything! You couldn't? You owe me an explanation. You can't treat me like this. You're sorry? What was I supposed to think? Why haven't you called? Why don't you answer your phone? Tom... What's going on, Tom? What happened? What happened to you? ... What's going on? What's wrong? Are you alright? Tom? Where have you been... ? Hello? Why the gun? I know. I understand. Betty's out of town so we're playing next week. You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it? You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend? I love you. You better not be smoking, that's all I can say. How's the detective business? Okay, I believe you. I'm not accusing you... Your clothing reeks of it. What's this... have you been smoking... ? Welcome home.We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work! No. ...I do. Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise. Hi, Adam. This is, uh.... Neat. Goodnight! Really? Okay! My pleasure. That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi? I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab. Uh-huh. Adam? Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before? Sing it to me. Is that what you call it? There. Well, you had better!! Look! I'm limping! How attractive is that?! What if this is for life?! Goodnight! Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck! What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!! Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!! And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit! This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous! I'm leaving, too. I don't blame you! Adam?! I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to! You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?! Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself. You're not from Alaska! Where'd you learn to dance like that?! And there are no starving people, are there?! Did you? What? Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be. Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me. Maybe. But that's how it works. Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals! Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it. Because we're bitches! Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails. Please! Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what "bitch" means, don't you? No way. What have you ordered? And don't be so obvious! Not that one! Quit showing off! We're here on business! Yes! No! Not crazy! Look unimpressed. Well...yeah. Okay. Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something-- Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean... Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think? Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight? Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?" He's going to kill himself. Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way! What about holding your right arm up like that all the time? Yeah. That's boring! Wazoo! Try to listen. Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash? So, what are you seeing? Uh...yeah. No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in the house. It's in there. Sure. He's gone to check your answers on his computer. Yeah, right! That's where you'd go to find girls! Nome. He's gay, by the way. You live in...Alaska. The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife! I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot? Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay? I thought only hookers drank those things. Here you go. One champagne cocktail. What?! He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months. And yes, I'll admit it. I've still kind of got a thing for him. That's what you wanted to know, isn't it? Yes! I was wrong!! Never drive again! You almost got us killed! Stop that ma'am crap! Now, get out!! Get out! Thank you. Could we talk about that a little later? Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time. When do you need her by? No dogs, huh? Okay. I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for? Everybody's divorced. Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad. Sure. The big one! You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites! Why?! What for? A wife? Think of me as your genie. Just ask. No, no! I'm sorry! What is it? Oh, I'm sure it will! Name it. Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat. Adam? Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay? Thank you. No problem. We'll just sell another baseball card. It's your life. And, by the way, it's a dandy. Night! Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning. Well, another day, another dollar. Stop staring at me!! What? Very funny, smart ass. Who are these people? Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper? Sure. I've got to make at least a thousand a week. What's the pay? How long would you need me? Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people? Doing what? It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is. Why?! Who the hell knows?! What? See, ya. Hey, no kidding? In color? The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow, it never works out. Okay? Not that you even need to know that! You look like crap, by the way. What have you been doing? Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know you like me. I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me. Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair. Or some combination of the above. No. Okay! Damn! I knew this would happen! You're like a lost puppy! Please don't follow me. Don't do it! Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit. Why are you doing that? Take it. damn it! Okay, down boy. I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it. Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase. I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked! I know a short-cut. You are one scary son-of-a-gun. Over this? How's that? Okay, okay! Take it easy! Perry? What is it?! Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM. So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway? Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in. I don't have to take a physical in your space ship? And that's it? So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel? Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars! Rogers Hornsby?!? Get away from me!! Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!! I mean it!! You don't? I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car. Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on. See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?! Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn? I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again? Yes, I'm right? Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far? Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing. Why doesn't that surprise me? Here, pick these up! What's wrong with you? A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead. Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead. You're lost? We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college. Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner. No, you get out of here. Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here-- --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self. Are you French? I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is... You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone. No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs-- No! Not the police! Don't call them! Oh, my God! Stop it, you two! Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel. So where is your roommate, the model? Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be. This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff. You came back for these? Your stuff? Let me see that. What are you doing here? Stop! Adam!! Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? I want to go home. Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop? Come on. What?! You didn't stop anywhere else?! Then what? Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?! He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that. Was it ever? Have him committed. I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn! We'll find him. Give it back to him. Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you? Gay. Oh, no! Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?! Coward! You're goddamn right I am! Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!! What?!! Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that. So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible. Where did he get all that information? Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is. What? Or have perfect table manners. Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean! And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!! In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days. What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn minute! To bed? Where are you going? Those sluts! I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he? Who did he leave with? What's that mean? He go back to the hotel? Go to the bathroom. It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are unpredictable. Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal. Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that?! For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us. Just be yourself. That water's freezing! No. I think...it...works. I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins. Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren? And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you? Well, that's blunt! What's that supposed to mean? Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo. Exactly. You understand that, don't you? You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that. Give me your hand. I even guessed his hotel, didn't I? Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs. Out-of-town. That's all he'll say. I knew you'd like him.No. Well, where are you -- This is your bedroom? No, wait! At least stay for dinner! What? A psychiatrist?! Are you in trouble, son?! Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do. Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything. Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer. Yes? I just hope this is still good up there. I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing. You're my brave boy. I'm afraid you've got to. He seems to be doing all right now. I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we need supplies and I've got to stay with him. Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom. You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president. Elbows, Son. Oh. A nice one, I hope. What can I offer you, Eve? Well, please excuse us! We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um... Well, that's...considerably shorter than before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the radiation is gone and... How long will you set it for this time? Amen. Yes, dear, I know. And the ocean! A mountain range! I want him to at least see the sky! No, Calvin. We're not going to make do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it's terrible! For how long? We've just about run out of everything! Excuse me. We do? Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now? I don't believe it! No. Mutants?! Yes! That's right! Yes, yes it is! Just open the door. Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work. Would you excuse me? Yes... Let's eat our cake. Calvin Webber! What a thing to say! Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family! What did you wish for, Adam? No kidding. Who else would have done it? Get the presents and do the lights. Calvin! Hi. Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept. Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school. Watch this! Very nice. Unless it caved in, too. Why? We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here? Calvin?! If I...you know... And I was wondering...if...if I could have a... What shall we call him? No, Calvin. Babies cry. Uh, oh. Now it's time. Oh, no. You have tranquilizers? No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me! Maybe I've just got the creeps. No, Calvin, you're favorite. I'm not hungry. All our friends... No. To go up. It's safe. Thirty -five years! The locks? What's that noise? To you maybe. As long as we've got that straight. Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers. But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time. Days?? How long will we have to stay down here? Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that? Cheese is particularly troublesome. Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates. Yes. I never know anymore. Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever. Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have-- We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat? Well, put it down and come in! For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got guests!Sure. Your mom was a dancer? You're kidding! We work on Rodeo Drive. But we're both professional dancers. He's really funny! This is my new friend... Bravo! Oh, now, that's a great one! Yes?I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway. Buy it from me? I'm selling this place. I want out of this hell hole! I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you? I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore! I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!Are ya ready? I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry. My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN! Well listen, I know how my boys take ta scrappin' when they take ta drinkin'. What did you do, Connor? Lord's name. All right, I suppose you have the right ta know. Still bickerin' over that, huh? Well, there's my boys. Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'. What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one! Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us. BLAME... I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger. I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor. It's all your fault. Both you little bastards. I was a fool to believe you would bring me any peace. The day your Da left us when you were almost too young to remember, he said the two of you would do me right and make me proud, but he was wrong and I got nothin' ta live for. Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this. Connor, is that you? Promise me boys. But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl. It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil. Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now. I... I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.Dr. Homer Wells. Wilbur, he picked them for us himself... These credentials are against the law! You invented him! You've completely made his up! This is your life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates! It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur. Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes. Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man. He'll need clothes... some money... They just want you to hire some new help. It was just the ether, Wilbur... Then I wasn't beautiful. You weren't dreaming about me. Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office. It claims to restore monthly regularity. Only if you can afford it.Good night, Daddy. Daddy, please ... Good night, Daddy. Wally said to say, "Hello." Daddy, it's a letter to me . It's time somebody ate them . No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry. I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter... This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot. Do you think she'll be all right? You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally! Please don't... Please... that's enough. I loved you, too--you know I did. Please don't make me say it again. What do you want me to do ? He's paralyzed ! For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down! Stop it! Just cut it out! If you're trying to be funny, Homer... Please don't move, don't go anywhere. No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want... No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too. Nothing. We've got to keep her away from that bastard! He's the father ! He's her baby's father! You don't understand! It's her father... She won't go to St. Cloud's! Well, we have to help her! We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there... It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it? No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I know I do. I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him. Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just teasing you? Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally? Olive told me. You might have told me yourself. We have to wait and see. I think that, for everything in life, you have to wait and see. It will be okay. I know this was right. Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges. Not with the right girl you wouldn't. You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't come here to watch the movie. The speaker . For the movie sound. Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally. Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies. Just a little privacy. But you had so much responsibility . You don't miss it? At least you were never lonely. What are you so crazy about the movies for? Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie. You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this. Well, she was in a weakened condition... I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible? She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart. She did love him! How many women have you known? But you looked as if you liked it. You've seen only one movie? Which one? When they watched at all. Do you like movies? Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout. I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you. You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then. When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I... ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet. So. Not bored yet? I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything. I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay. I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back! Burma! He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him! Really? No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman. Two. Candy. Candy Kendall. You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's Muddy ! Is it Muddy? Why? I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you... Yes, I have ! Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this. I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me. Hi... Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places... He thinks people like to get whacked by branches. You've been giving him a flying lesson! I know what you've been doing. I love you, Wally. There! You said it was boring. You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying." Wally thinks apples are boring. No--keep it down. I want to feel the air. I'm okay--I can walk. So many children. Are they all orphans?I fail to see how a little Christianity could hurt anyone here! You can't think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow -- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is? I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here. Do you know him?No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just... I can't go nowhere. You ain't been through what I been through, Candy. I don't need no more clothes, thank you. Hi... How is that Wally doing? It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been wonderin' about it! That's it ? Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself! You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going nowhere . Happy ! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby. Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business. Not yet. What do you know about it? I guess you must like watchin' me be sick... Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer? Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is. You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope. I can't read. Nobody taught me. So what? What you got a picture of your heart for? What's that? Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber? That's right, Homer. This ain't your business. I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go. You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please... You just stay out of trouble, Homer! Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off him was his clothes! We should drown that damn Jack in the vat! That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer. What's lucky about that? Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes every night.Jeremiah... what's gotten into you? Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah. If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you. He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it. What?! Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you. What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less! I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot. You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome. Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences? Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis. It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags. You're going to be late if you don't hurry up and change soon. Jeremiah, what are you doing? NOW!I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer. I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess! I gotta work with these women. Loretta, don't do that. Airport Ho-Jo! There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh! I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons! It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God! Ah! It's from State! Oh my God! I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time. Okay. Really? I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this. ...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me. I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer... Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over. Loretta, never have kids. My mom wanted me to have this? Really, Loretta? Oh-yah. No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him. Oh my God. I'm so dead... So, what do I say? Oh God, I'm dead... I -- I'm quittin' the pageant. Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse! Where is she?! Is Mom okay? Yah? Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't. Your parents'd kill you. "Here," wh-wh-what? I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete. But, you -- I mean... It's not my fault. I -- I... Please? I didn't do anything wrong... I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight. Mrs. Leeman? I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent. Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys." I'm gonna need more caps. No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head. -- red nose and ears. I know, I know. Sorry. I just thought she might not wanna meet her Maker lookin' like a cheap whore. It's okay. Bye mom. I love you much. God I hope that's you and not your concussion talkin'. That's it, I'm goin'... Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary. Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again. Ow! Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant. Mom! Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant. Oh, Mom, it's so ugly. They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie. That's my mom. I'll get 'em in a sec. ...Yah -- 1963. Her beauty worked against her when she started as a reporter in Louisville, her hometown. Those were different times. Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany! This, this... This is bullshit! But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule? Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on? I hate her! No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it? Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone. Bitch! Oh, I'll "get it." I'll "get it" all right. I might even take seconds. Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on. I just did. You heard me. Where is it? What're you doin' here? Yes, Leslie! Yes... Yeah... Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy. Here, I didn't get any. Bye. Yah-sure, fine... fine. I know. Then it must be Wednesday. Here, I'll take it. It's my job. Hi.We was robbed. C'mere. I love you so much. It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber. Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you... Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day. You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels. Would yous boys excuse us a second? Loretta, you too. What?! I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails. Go on! Get out! Ruined a brand-new pair of Lee Press- ons. Well, I sat down for a beer and KA- BLEWEY! Next thing I know, somethin' blows through my kitchen window. Next thing I know, I'm ass up in Loretta's flower bed. Oh... How quickly they grow up. Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first. Oh shit! Hey, Amber, y'get my smokes? They told me to practice. We was robbed. Oh-Jesus-Mary-n-Joseph, she's pregnant! If you are -- come back, sweetie. Mommy wants to talk, then KILL YOU! Go on home, Loretta. Come on. Go on, the party's over. Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down. You don't know where this is gonna... They're makin' a movie, here, goddamn it. I'll be right back. See ya later. "Most smartest?" Oh, that's good, Loretta. Make sure you get a picture of that. "Most smartest." We're cuttin you off and sendin' you home. Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta. Shut it up, Loretta. Loretta, shut it. This here's Loretta. It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em. Hi. You could be quiet. Oh, Jesus H. Christ!What a surprise. Gladys Leeman's finally gonna go to State. And she'll probably ride on Becky's ass all the way to Nationals, too. Yeah. Girls check in, but they don't check out. Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win. ...Oh, yeah-right. I ain't gonna be in no goddamn pageant! Look what happened to that dork-ass farm girl.Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out! Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go. I'm sorry. They're just starin'. I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a... All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo." Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber... What? For chrissakes, spit it out. This came for you, sweetie. Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'. No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float. You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people. What is wrong with you? Thank God for bunge cords. Well God-love-ya for thinkin' I still could. Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep. You-betcha. That was your mom. She wanted you to have this. "Once a carnie, always a carnie." Hell-no, she ain't quittin'. Yeah, you betcha... Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie. I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart! You're what?! Don't let that worry you, Annette! She's right over there. She's alive, sweetie. Annette, just use your hand. Okay. Take her purse. Annette, why don't you just see if there's any beer left in that can and relax a bit. Anyone? So? Be real easy. I got a hairdo. All right, they're makin' a movie. Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here. Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know... She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest... Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber. Oh, Christ, it's true. Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need. Say, yous boys been to the Leeman's? I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall." You guys want a beer? Oh, naw. Hi. Hi. Are we on "Cops" again? What do you mean, they take out her butt?I wonder how she's gonna fix that one. Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health. This pageant's like a roach motel. Tammy Curry?He always has to make the big entrance. No I didn't. What? Down there. Those blue things ate everybody here? I don't know. Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children... Alex? Where are you going? FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE! The ships are gaining... Shit! I'm doing it! I'm repeating the damn computer! All this from watching the.. historical records? I don't know... It just wasn't like him. You could order something in. Why didn't you stop at the market? Alex you can't -just leave. Oh Alex, get away from that thing... The guy is terminally selfish! All systems are working, Commander. All systems are working, Commander. No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere. We need another one. It's fractured... Computer, what about our engines? Why don't we have power? The enemy is matching velocity. Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!... I never get tired of that joke. What's the weather like outside? I just can't believe it. Any of it! Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven. Oh and wait, wait, listen to this! Computer? We're getting major structural damage. How the hell is Fred supposed to project a hologram? Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy. Oh, they're so cute. Where are the miners? Guy, you HAVE a last name. We just don't KNOW it. The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document. THAT'S why you built this ship? You... know us? Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement. never doubted you for a second. He's accelerating to Mark 6. Well forget it! I'm not going. This episode was badly written! We shouldn't have to DO this! It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE? What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.' Wait... Jason, Here!... Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either. So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor? Jason?... I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak... Turn on the translation circuit. Nothing. Hold please. Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there. Thank God. Are you okay? Jason.. Can you hear me? Clenched jaw... How does the rolling help, actually? Why does this sound so familiar? You're playing your good side. I could have held on to YOU! ... Self control? That's funny coming from the guy that slept with every Moon Princess and Terrakian slave girl on the show!... Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard? Computer, can it be repaired? No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but... Something is. Oh my god. I don't think that's a cloud... I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is??? JASON... Jason.. There's nobody here. Jason... We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW. We have no right to do this. They deserve to know. Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING. Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING... Well you have to tell them. What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff! Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED? Wait. When are you going to tell them? On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built. Only answers to me. One minute I'm - Hey, I'm dressing.' You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?... What? How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing? Tommy, look! Those lights... What are you doing? What are thev doino? Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now? Wait, Fred, what about your thing, you know... "Digitize me, Sergeant Chen!" We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals! Teb, reset the pod, we're going back. Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod! I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT? I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre! Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it. You gotta admit, they do love him. Unbelievable. You're kidding. When for? This is great! They're going to start eating each other out there.Yes, baby? Alright, we'll do that tomorrow. That remote control thing? I'm cooking pasta primavera. How about you? Do you want more rice? ...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after... Yes... Jeffrey. I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry... That's for food. Use the bathroom. Please don't wash your hands in the sink. An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry. ...taping? What are you taping? I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you... No, thank you. What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house? Why? Who said? I don't understand. Why did you take your stuff from the office? Right now? What do you need at the store? Uh, what are those boxes? I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...? Yes, it's on the stove... Don't you have to be at the office?You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it. No, you do not. Get some perspective, Lowell. So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else. Jeffrey Wigand... Oh, baby... What are you and Mike going to do? What?! What's wrong? I have to take a shower. ...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from? Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow. Hello? Yeah... No classes this morning? It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City..."There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc? -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass. I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it -- He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. He liked to acquire things. It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I? We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon. It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened. Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written." -- The argument had nothing to do with it. Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids. I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday. Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm. They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that? It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me. Why are they ganging up against me? What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.Well, come on in. You do? Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise. It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees. I'd better get in there. I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... Oh? Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love. Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes. Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing. Yes, you do, you damn well do. I want to give you something. Will you let me? Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal. I don't want you to be mad at Skip... Doc. Doc... ...so accomplished. It's a pleasure to meet you. You're on your own today, honey. They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour. No gentleman caller, Doc. Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening. Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park. It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20. And the Brocketts? Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place? Doc. Ainge... Not sure. Let me think about it. So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret? You know who that is, don't you? You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down. Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined. How long you been in this town? You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything. Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is. I think it's like... inquisitive. Who was that? You're early... it's not ready. What happened?It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister. What kind of doctor are you? Do you think that's a good idea? What's happening here? Mumford... like the town? Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter. No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling. Just who is here, can you tell me? Well, look who's here... Take a hike, Dr. Quack! -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl. Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it. I think you do. I think you know what I mean. Finally, some common sense... What? What'd you want? Oh... not a real doctor.He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage. I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune. I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines. ...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus. First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see -- He said -- "Which we already knew!" ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded." No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo. There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer... This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial? I don't think you know what you're talking about. These appointments were not my idea, remember. What are you talking about? I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew. What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing... Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous. Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look. It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something... I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew... Have women found you attractive? Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew! The point is, you have a lot of the signs. Fuck the community. There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating. Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly? The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that? Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing. Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff? In maybe three or four issues. ...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.Mother... go away! Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway. We're going for a walk. Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford. Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast. We're only talking about six weeks. You got off easy. What is your name? ...but first, you have to tell me something... Oh. I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood. What? But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done. I am irate! You deserve it. You feel violated? ...How violated I feel? Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called. Which show was that? Mother... I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- Hello? Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... ...that I am in love with you. Transference! I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well. The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean? I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings. Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way. First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you. All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you? No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- Why? Is there something I should have heard about you? How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me. Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford. It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship. I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in? Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. Not one who's treating me, of course. And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence. You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you. Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. -- you've been a tremendous help to me. I bet I know what changed your mind... ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me. My brother said you were about to fire me. Why'd you come to the house the other night? Which thing? When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down. And this is legitimate therapy? It's all right. I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old? And he's where? So whose route is this? No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so. And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing That was really bad, wasn't it? ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me. You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard... Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second? I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way. Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip. You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage? Is that like a party trick? No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache. I don't know if I mentioned the headaches. Where? Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused. Uh-huh. Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble. My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?... I'm embarrassed. The list is so long. 'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach. Is this the treatment? No. You've got a funny idea of funny. What? Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"... We don't discuss it. Is that the technical description of what I've got? She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about. Mom's such a cutie. Oh boy... this should be interesting. I'm not making any promises. Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed? Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down. You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny? I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying. I don't know. I barely made it today. What would you do? Even if you don't think it's real? Hmm? Is that a professional opinion? No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite. That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true. I saw it. I saw it in your eyes. You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you? About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit. Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve. I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.Intestines. Oh yes, always. What just happened? That's one way of putting it. Exactly -- I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life -- In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me. And you think this justifies killing innocent people!? What is he doing here? See the cartouche there, it's the official royal seal of Seti the First, I'm sure of it. You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library. I'm sorry, it was an accident. Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years. What are you doing here? Twenty. Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent. I would never! Three hundred pounds! Two hundred pounds. I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life. I am an English woman. Where are they taking him? And what did he say? And what is he in prison for? Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them. I have no choice. Got it! I think you were jealous You called me your girl? The creature!? Are you sure!? I'm staying. That's what I am to you? A contract? It's everybody's problem! According to that Book, once this creature has been reborn, his curse will spread, and as he grows in strength, so will his curse grow, infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed. Then we'll have to find some immortal ones. Alright then, Me, I,... I read the book, I woke him up and I intend to stop him. No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him. No, we are not. Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one. It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book. Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt. According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed. Very slowly. No. I've never seen a mummy look like this. He's, he's still... Oh my god, I've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl. No... Why?... Should I? Why would I do that? I'm not? I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell. I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am. Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this? No. I believe if I can see it and I can touch it, then it's real. That's what I believe. You two! How? A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about. Quarried granite with a cobalt lining. They didn't, they buried him at the foot of Anubis. He was either someone of great importance. Or he did something very naughty. Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus. You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys. For entering the afterlife. Oh my god, It's a preparation room. Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see. According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living. That "thing" gets me excited. For what? Are you sure? Well of course I can swim, if the occasion calls for it. Oh that's comforting. You know your history. I don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, The Book Of The Living. It's what first interested me in Egypt as a child. It's why I came here, sort of a life's pursuit. Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually. Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there? Did I miss something? Are we going into battle? If you call that a kiss. The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners. Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more. Yes. Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location? What did you find? What did you see? No, I mean -- You swear? Yes, well... I know my brother. You were actually at Hamunaptra? How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra? No? We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it. Broad?! Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus! What's it look like!? Finish the inscription, idiot! Read the inscription on the cover! Shut-up and get me off of here! Yes. He's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing. Well neither do I, thank you. I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk. What do you suppose killed him? It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this According to my calculations, we should be right under the statue. We'll come up right between his legs. Oh my. After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet. Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit. Do you really think he'll show up? But he's just a filthy criminal? You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?! I'm your sister. You lied to me! You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes! All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C. Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt. He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all. I think you found something. Jonathan? Oh no, not another worthless trinket, Jonathan, if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you. Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours. Have you no respect for the dead? You...! YOU...!Stay away! Who? What? I'd better go. Curiosity. I'm not that kind of girl. Who's the artist? How 'bout giving me "the tour"? Just wanted to... powder my nose. Hi. Sure -- I guess. Really? Just a waitress. Really? Bye. Roy... We might never see each other again, so I'd better tell you now... I think you're wonderful. Then at least I will have died trying, right? Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you -- Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing. I'm going inside. At the Frankenstein Center. It's me. That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy. You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him. You don't seem very angry right now. Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does. I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but... Yeah. Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart. Have you always lived here? What's your real name? I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress. Who wouldn't? Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people. Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish. I admire you. That was easy. I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home? Date? Alone tonight? Not tonight. I guess... Are you always so angry? Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero stuff and join Kiwanis or something. Here you go. So what can I get you? Really? Wow. So you're like... struggling superheroes? Are you famous? Really? Like Captain Amazing? You guys going to a costume party?Ever since you were a little boy... Come with me. I always knew that you were special. Jeffrey... this is wonderful. But... the silverware? And why are you wearing that silly costume? Jeffrey, YOU THIEF! It's on the television. What are you doing in the silver drawer? Jeffrey!What did you use? What are you going to do to him? I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build. How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction? Pollution? I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going. Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb? No, thank you. You can't mean that. But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it. No. If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself. Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation. Make me? How? You think he's going to torture me? You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him? You're afraid of him. Nigel, can't you see he's using you? Is that what Argon told you? Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you? There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that? Opportunity? I don't believe this is happening... Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now. The replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown. You were never invited to my house. What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested. I hope you're right. I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care. This day just keeps going from bad to worse. The replicators? They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing. Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man. They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element. Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs? I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it. Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school. This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time. What? Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I was just thinking... Things do change. Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place. God, what a fight that was. God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that? Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you? How about 'infantile dementia'? You're not going after Argon! Daniel, just forget Argon. Let's get out of here. We'll find another way to stop the waste. The same thing I suppose. Yes. It's too late. Argon injected it. Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower. You don't have to say anything, Daniel. I'm a scientist. I know what's happening. I recognize the classic symptoms. Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body... Did you think I could just leave you...? Run, Daniel! Get out of here! Argon's private lab. Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot! I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you. I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God. You're not going back to jail. All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon -- Oh no. They're trying to blame you for the accident. That means they must not have been able to control the replicators. Who is he? Did you go? Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers. Like a glove. It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent. That's pretty good. I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids. I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza. Something else I want to try. I'm going to go out for a while. I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need. How far can you stretch? The nanobot... it's not here... Daniel, I didn't hear you come down... No problem. Probably the caffeine. I'm glad you came to me for help. Just like old times. Come on, I don't see you living in a cave! And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world! You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress! Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved! You have no one to blame but yourself. What's that supposed to mean? I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. It's got to mean something. The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong? What about it! What? What's wrong? Is something wrong? Lungs sound fine. You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you? Allergies? Infections? I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you. That's right. With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else. Three days ago it was. The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize. The problem is the by-product created by the process. The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being. To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level. The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste. If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically. The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those. Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom. What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry. We don't have time for hysterics. Daniel! Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure. Yes. It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment. I don't know. My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse. ... just like the mouse. The nanobot. Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist. Daniel, what are you doing here? Daniel, give him the Trix. You're insane. I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig -- We've had this conversation already, Daniel. God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange. We'll see? What does that mean? And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole. It's really wonderful. Nothing really worthwhile. Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going. It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all. And for cleaning up oil spills. It already is. I guess I should be flattered. Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals. The big house? Is that so? Same old Daniel. Really? What have you been doing? When did you...? Daniel... Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with. Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off! You won't. That's why you're whispering. Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job? Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority -- Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger. If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement -- I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations. Can I help you, Mrs. Argon? What in the hell? Yes, he might be. Yes, that is what I was thinking. It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money. Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella. We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere. Of being found out. Of not being a genius You're just scared.

The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander-- You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything? Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special. I did my best but, well, you know me When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star. He needs me here. I can't And attractive in a hammy sort of way. Mr. Welles certainly is a caution It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle? With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks. That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me. God, these parties are the worst And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice! I don't want you to-- I just want to understand-- Fuck you, Mr. Kane. Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this-- You will not walk out on me But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?! There's a different between want and Did you need it? Did you need any of it? I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake. That -- did you need that? How much did that cost? You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything-- You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it-- You gotta wake up now. Pops. I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it. A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?! Then you explain it to me?! I am not that woman. Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her! Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore. Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh How does one get 125 million dollars in debt? We're 125 million dollars in debt? How much? How much? Pops How bad is it? Don't You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all. Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w... will. There. That's right. This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself-- There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you! Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life! As I said I have some j-j-j-j- that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate-- Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to-- Thank you- Yes. I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--Good for you. J. C. Penny's? Chuck E. who? It's our pleasure.Cole, please stop. Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that. What? I would never think that about you... ever... Got it? ...I don't know. They talk to you? You see ghosts, Cole? Dead people? They? Cole, you're scaring me. Where is she? You can see her? Oh my God. They did? Yeah. Communicate? I'd give anything to have been there. There's only two of us. Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer? Is that what happened? So who moved it? You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again? Did you move the bumble bee pendant? That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart? It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be. Lots of things. They're right here. I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say. I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school. Cheese. It's a kid's place. The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out. ...He doesn't get invited places.Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose -- It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys. If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together. Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open. Oh, it was. Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks. Oh darling -- is that for me? It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee. I don't like you. No, I like him. Okay, darling. It's vile. I'll come down. Hi Tom. I don't get it. What? What? I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini. Shut up! Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed. Yes, Tom Ripley's here. Well, we ate everything without you. You just woke up! Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink. You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie? How do you do. I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. Such as? I just don't believe that! Where's Mr MacCarron? I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you. Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day? What are you going to do now, Tom? I don't believe a single word you've said. I don't believe you. Why? When? Why do you have Dickie's rings? I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra. He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day -- I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring. You've got Dickie's rings. I found Dickie's rings. Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent. Tom? Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap. Did Dickie's Dad go? Very. To the manner born. He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared. Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him. Tom. Hello Peter, so good to see you. Perhaps I shouldn't go either. Where does Dickie live? What? Dickie? I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face? Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? Did he kill Freddie? He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home. Dickie was at the Opera last night. You were going to Venice. Is he really not here? Is he here? Are you with Dickie? Oh my God. Tom. He hates being confronted. How long's he staying for? Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited... Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone? What does that mean? Ha. Did he say why? Where's Dickie? Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks. Tom, you startled me! You're back. I'll go. Dickie! Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms. Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way. He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times... The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold. Are you okay? You really should go in, it's marvelous. Frances? Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday. Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life. Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man. I never said that! Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? What's going on? How would you know that? I told you! I knew it! Dickie? Do you know Dickie? No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you. A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched. This is spectacular. Golly. Who's paying for this? Is this you? He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him. So you found Peter... I hope so. Do you know Tom? I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people. No glasses.He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it? Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you. You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie. Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him. So -- are you travelling under R? You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible. You're kidding. When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. Hardly. I couldn't be less alone. What? I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you... Dickie, my God! I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps? Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight... Beating you away. No, I absolutely understand. Of course. Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. Okay then, you're crazy. You're crazy! It's freezing out there. I thought you were enjoying yourself? Show me the other one again. I like them both. I've never admitted that to anyone. The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it. Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -- Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R. Everybody knows Freddie Miles. At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -- But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you? Right. As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too. The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue. Which is? So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there. You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's? Hello. I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall. No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating. What's your secret?Then don't. Hmm. You know that's really a shitty middle name! Well, that's what your friends call you. I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend. Oz, it's okay, I know. This isn't any better, Chris. This isn't the best way to proposition me. What's that? You're missing the game for us?! What about the game?! ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. You can't sing at the competition. ...yeah. So we're gonna be close next year? Sure. Yeah. You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know. And they're like, "You'll figure it out." Yeah? When? Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one. Yeah. So wow, you've got it figured out. Oh, yeah. So what're you gonna major in? What? Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern. I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was? So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it. That's nice. Really? Cool. Tell him his subs are great. Well...I needed to find you. We are gonna have to practice that song. Stifler told me. Hi... Yeah? Well you can't fake your way through this. You better practice. Why are you doing this? Give me a break, you're so full of it. I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies. Oh, please. I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with. But you are just a jock. No wait. You're a jerk. No, I like the car. By the way, though, about prom? That was like a bad idea. Sorry I invited you. I'm glad you think so. Yeah, me too, okay, cool. Okay. So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone -- Come on! I won't tell. What's your middle name? Do I have to? Um...Chris -- Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience. You like, "kicked butt." Oh...well that's okay. Cool. Well the same things you do. Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever. What do you think I do? You? You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss." Of course, I didn't -- Okay. I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something? Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there. Not bad, Chris.Sure. Are you kidding? You've never double- clicked your mouse? Well that's a no. No wonder you're not psyched about sex. You've never even had one manually? Of course he does. What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period? Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex. So did you do the physics write-up? What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for? Milk and cookies? Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet. Yeah right. Duh. Of course. Naturally, I embellished a little bit. Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman? Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now. That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera." So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed. So he did, and I did. Are you kidding? No. Thanks. It was my idea. No comment. Well it's up to you. The Big L, or the Big O. Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her. That's how I was duped. Do you love her? Do you? No. No you haven't. You got it, stud. I'll give you a hint. "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!" Comprende? Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you. What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons. You gotta give her what she's never had.Okay! Don't you want me to? Come on. I saw you on the net. Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing! Now, I have two rubbers. Wear them both, it'll desensitize you. I don't want you coming so damn early. What, you think I don't know how to get myself off? Hell, that's what half of band camp is! Sex ed! Oh! And then this one time? At band camp? I stuck a flute in my pussy. Yes! And he was such a dork! And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care? Because it was so funny! Well, this one time? At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it? But it's called spin the bottle? And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips? And... You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual. That is a nasty story! Are they gross or something, like guy stuff? Tell me. It reminds me of this one time -- Hey, can I ask you a question? How come you don't have any stories? I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any. You know, at band camp? We have dances like this. Only they're way funner. Don't you think prom is just highly overrated? Cool! We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp... Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards? That would be so cool. Really? You seriously want to go with me? Michelle. I thought so. Because, one time? I was at this -- Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.I had no idea you'd be this good! Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me? Aged eighteen years. Why don't you get the glasses. Behind the bar. All right, I got some scotch. I believe the kegs are upstairs. Pardon me? I'm so happy for you. Takes the edge off, doesn't it? And where might your date be? As if there were any alternative in the matter. Are you enjoying yourself?Jessica, can you drive me home? ...I've never tried it. I think I've had one. He likes it. Please. Jessica! He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready. It's got to be completely perfect. I want the right place, the right time, the right moment. That's not why we're going out. What? We both have cars. Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M. Your little pact. Jessica told me all about it. Way to go, Kev! I know. Let's go. Don't you have something to tell your friends? No, Kevin -- That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing. That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything. Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it. Yeah, the time went by so fast. Yeah. I love you. I want to hear you say it. Okay. I don't know. How do you? Okay. Did you bring a condom? Yeah. You sure you're comfortable? Yeah, are you? Wow, Kev...it's perfect. No...I know the perfect time... Kevin... I want to have sex with you. And I want to make things perfect for you. You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special. So have I. And I know you want to make things perfect for me. And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it. Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville? Okay. Kevin...you're not your dad. The two of us, we're not your parents. But you don't love me. Kevin? Do you not love me? Yes -- I think you're so right, Kevin. Like how? Yeah, we have. You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five. It's everyone's trick, Kevin. But I did pick it up from you. No, I'm not. I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems. Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April. Oh Kevin -- don't stop! Oh...ungghhhhh! How? I think "shithead" really says it. Not for you. Let me know. Tonight? Oh, Kev. Kevin, this is serious! You think so?Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly. I know. People make mistakes. I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle. You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you? Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside. It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way. A better friend. The monkey. It's Elijah. I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question. My God! You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man. I need a shower. Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before. You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway. You fell in love with her first. Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head. What's that? It'll never happen, fuckface. What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously. You bastard. Suck my dick! I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head? Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship. I'm sorry. That was nasty. Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with. Me and John. We love her, Craig. I'm sorry. Yes. Fuck Maxine. Us, of course. I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus. You've always hated the animals. I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me. I'm getting rid of the fucking animals. Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history. What are you doing? Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it. It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We�ll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away. You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture. Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man. Don't crowd me, Craig. I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly. Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery. I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing? Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her? I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig. I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was. I have to go back now. I have to go back. I'm scared. Now? I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours. I want to try. Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain. 'kay. No thanks. I'm going to turn in. I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed. The iguana. Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected. I was worried. Did you eat? Hi. She's very beautiful. Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh? They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach. Seven-ish Isn't that cute? I just taught her that. Why, Craig. why? Why'd you do it, Craig? Is the trial date set? The monkey. Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning. Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor? Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around. Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something. Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing. I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak. Hush, sweetheart. Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who? I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it? That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich. Why not? I need to get in there! It's Craig in there, I can tell. You bastard! No. No, I didn't know that. No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine... Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester. But now we've lost access to Craig. I blew it, Dr. Lester. But why, Son of Malkovich? I'm getting divorced. Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom? Yes, of course, Dr. Lester. But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved. Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him! We have to meet. I have to see you. Maxine... Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart. Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly. I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over? After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy. I've never been looked at like this by a woman. Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig. Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet? Yes, Hi.J.M. Inc. Be all that someone... How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major. Let him try. Lotte? Is that you? Lotte, this is so good... A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution. Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig. You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin. I've fallen in love. You're late. So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein. Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me. Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc. I'll protect you, Dollface. Sure. It'd be fun. Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me. Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop. Good. We'll sell tickets. Is this Malkovich fellow appealing? What's he been in? Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich? It better be. No. You might want to check those tarot cards one more time. Yikes. You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls. So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy. Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Not a chance. I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene. You're a fag or a liar. Don�t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off. Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time. My tits? The usual, Barry. You married? Just. I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated. Somebody told you. Who told you? Who told you? Why not? Yeah. What? You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo. And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants. Yes, well... I wouldn't know. How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog! Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?. Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors. Two hundred dollars, please. You can be John Malkovich. No. Don't be an ass. No. I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken. Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon. One hour. Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers. J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be. I love you, Lotte. When? Yes? Ah. And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me. Let her go, Craig. I mean �him." Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..." Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife? Whatever. Yeah what?! Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. You've got to be kidding. Bad dream, darling? Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us? This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen. Vegas. It's okay, my sweet. Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant! No one would ever have to know its not him. Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally. Stay in him forever? You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people! That was incredible. You're brilliant! I'd love to see your work. Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey. You still there, sweets? I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it. Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now. Lotte called me. Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there? I can explain about the portal, darling. Darling! Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold. Oh, Lotte... Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte. Do you mind? So, do you enjoy being an actor? Thanks so much for coming over. Whatever you're having. It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and... You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours. Mr. Malkovich?Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable? I am not asking for alms, but rather the ear of a kind man with a noble heart. I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions. Captain Mertin?Count me in. Do we get to wear a crown? You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?Come on up. Who is it? This is not a good time. No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough. I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up. OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it. Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him. I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad. Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has. What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself. You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me? No, no. Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault. I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time. Promise you won't go inside. I shouldn't have asked you to come. No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend. If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go. I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M. Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick. I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up. I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this. Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this? You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times. Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen? How long you been doing this? You married? Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ? On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school? Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood? Not as good as Nino's. My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ... Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean? He's better, though, right? You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist. Okay. You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you. Sleeping. I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom. I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders. I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice. He's better, isn't he? I'll be right down. Yes? I'd take her, but then who would stay here? My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance. Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean? It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me. Did you see my father? I think this place stinks. He's dead, huh? That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he? That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside. You shouldn't smoke. That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home. Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father. I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say. I mean if he was dead, I could handle that. It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door. It's my first cigarette in over a year. It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water. Is there any chance? I know him. That's Noel. Is he going to be alright? John, play the Sinatra. What?I know. Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride? His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there. I have his journal. Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian. You heard me. Oh cut the shit, Kathryn. Thank you. I'll be fine. That's right. You might say that. I don't think so. Annette Harrison. Okay... You promise not to say anything? Forever. I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy. I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him. What do you mean? No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him? Nothing. Really? I thought he said it all the time. But you knew this was important to me. You don't know how to love. Why are you trying to hurt me? I love you. What are you saying? Yeah, me neither. Would you like a tour? Hi. I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. Was it -- Hi. Please don't go. How am I a hypocrite? Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms. I think that's for the best. Where are you going? It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please. You really want to know? That's not fair. I have feelings for you. I thought you said we were going to be friends. Why are you doing this? Bonjour Monsieur Philipe. Who's Monsieur Philipe? Not at all. Have a seat. No? Oh dear, are you actually laughing? Fine. Lighten up. It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously. No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me. That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person. You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady. You must take me for a real idiot. "I actually feel good about myself?" Oh please. Okay. You? Volunteer? I don't think so. I'm doing some volunteer work. Sure. Have a good night. You're not gonna start that again. Somerset Maugham. What are you reading? What are you doing? Wait, don't hang up. It wasn't a date. He's just a friend. I'm... I'm alright. No, not at all. It's not about being happy. You and I can't - If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends. Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York. And you promise to abide by it? You truly want to do something to make me happy? That's also none of your business. I'm busy. That's none of your business. I can't. I'm seeing a friend. Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual. You don't even know me. I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior. And that's a bad thing? I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends. It was fine. I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me. Give it up. No thank you. That's repulsive. You're naked. I'm sorry, but you're not my type. I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends. Because you act like a pig. Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work. Shut up. Thank you. Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time. I never said that. About what? How's the water? The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. I sincerely doubt it. This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. Give me a minute. I'll be right down. Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse. At this hour? I don't think so. You need help. Romantic? He rapes her. You've read The Fountainhead? The Fountainhead. Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read. Excuse me. Excuse me! Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot. Why are you being so dramatic? It's not really important. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question. A friend wrote me. Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it? I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions. That's a first. Most people praised me for it. You did? Are you often this offensive on a first encounter? No. I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies. No. Junior. German. Ben Schwarz. My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time. My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick. It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.I'll see you tomorrow. Doctor King is my favorite. Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera. Oh, I suck. I suck. Okay. I'm in the bath, mom. Those are my letters! Where did you find those? What are the boys like? Cool. It's like a secret society. But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it? I don't love him. I love Ronald. I am? I did? Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one. What do I do then? If that's what you call it. No. Well... not exactly. I don't know. If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night. It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me. I... I don't think you want to know. Something awful happened last night. Who is it? Best friends. You'd do that for me? Why? Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room. Okay. I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him. I don't know. No. Is it that obvious? What are you saying? That was cool. Okay. It was nothing. I guess. It still sounds gross. Are you for real? Eww. No. That's gross. Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do? You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared. What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend. He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July. Thanks. Nice meeting you. What was that? Prude. Want a blow job? Need any company? Where are you going? Is it me? I'm sorry. I like it better when I'm on top. Am I suppose to be this sore? Want to join me? But - What are you doing? Just a kiss, right? And then I can go home? Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom. My mom? Don't call my mom. I want to go home. I want to go home. I look terrible. What are you doing? You think he'll like it? But I thought high school is only four years. What year are you in? My father just took me on a trip to Australia.Would you please leave. Good luck, Sebastian. Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s. My daughter, Rachel. I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble. No it doesn't. I see right through you. You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian. This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you. No. This is going to be our last session. I think that's all the time we have for today. Don't you want to change that? But you said you have the worst reputation. And you haven't made an ounce of progress. Jesus. We've been at this for six months. Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid? Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle. Who told you? Honey, is something wrong?You can't do this to me. It could ruin me. You didn't show it to anybody? You what? Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he - Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect. Excuse me? Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but - Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine. Are you okay? I'm sure you're going to love it there. Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood. Did you know Sebastian well? Have we met? I'm Kathryn. That's one way of looking at it. Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it. So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible. Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you. I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman. Cecile, you had an orgasm. Well did you like it? Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did. Well what then? He made you give him a blow job. So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you. Why didn't you do something? Does your mother know? Cecile, you have to tell me. What do you mean?! Calm down. Tell me what's wrong. It's Kathryn. Of course I would. We're friends, right? Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house. I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me. Did you hide the letters? Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never. Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me. Well do you like him? That's so romantic. Have you responded? Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you. Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime. Eyes closed. Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is. See that wasn't so bad. Do you want to learn or not? It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me. Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends? What are you scared of? That's great. Really? Bulimic headcase. So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice. I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum. I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language. Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and -- I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to. It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me. And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got... I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over. It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind. No. It's Kathryn. Ronald? What do you do? Tell her you love her. Likewise I'm sure. I think you have your answer. And if I don't? Get out! Didn't you hear what I said? I accept. Now get out. Fine! Get off me! Get off me! I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers. You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers. Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you. To my triumph, of course. Well done. Not that it's any of your business but yes. I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company. Well done. Annette? Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room? A little melodramatic, don't you think. I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance. How have you dumped girls in the past? Why so nervous? Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away. Is that what you think? Not anymore you don't. It's obvious. At first it was, but now it's become something bigger. I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore. P-whipped, p-whipped. Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped. I want to fuck. And that's why you're leaving? Excuse me? Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping. No, tell me. Oh come on. For her first time? Tell me all the details. You didn't? Kind of. She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again. You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago. If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her. You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump. So what went wrong? She shot you down. Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus? So? How'd it go last night? Morning! Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride? And that's why you're losing your bet? She's really getting to you, isn't she? What's your problem? Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book. That her? Who are you spying on? I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems. Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out? What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience. I'm aware. Cecile. Well, let me know when you do. Until then. Have you succeeded in your task? I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny. Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good. I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo. Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder. The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher. No. Interesting. What's wrong with you? Shhh. Call me later. Loser. Fuck her yet? It would feel so yummy. You can put it anywhere. Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you. In English. I'll fuck your brains out. I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married. If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine. Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer? I'll think about it... You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league. B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy. Jesus Christ, is she for real? I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge? Why not? She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie. I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery. Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered. I don't find this very funny, In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent. Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you. Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid. I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing. Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall. Oh please. I can't have you do that. You will be discreet about this? I know. She's so young and he's so - It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher. Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and... It's Cecile. I hope I didn't keep you from something. Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples. I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works. You're too kind. I'll do my best.Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs. Rosemond's before lunch. Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now. Margarita found them while cleaning your room. Cecile, is that the best you can do? You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never been in a co-educational atmosphere before. It's the least I can do. Let me get that for you. Absolutely. I can't thank you enough. Black. Ronald? That's crazy. Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it? What about her? Not at all. What's wrong? I got your message and came as quick as I could. Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse. That's beautiful. How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. Where do you get your strength? I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her. Oh don't give me any of that racist crap. My husband and I gave money to Colin Powell. Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?! Is that so? I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child. Who the hell do you think you are?!I understand. Good night. I'll do that. Young man, I already told you she's not here. Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so - She's out. She's not here. What do you want? I'll do that. I've already told you, she's not home. You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.Oh... no thank you... Excuse me? I did? We played backgammon? I did? Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -I don't think so. Yeah? Well I'm not starting now. Ed -- Ed -- Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off -- Pursued, not harassed. Give it some space. Can I tell you something -- as a friend? My sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child For what it's worth. Leave her be. Ed, do you want my advice? Great line. Yeah. That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month. We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month! A woman wants to be pursued. Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari? Uh-huh? How you doing, Ed? Good idea. Could you all leave us alone for a few minutes? Yes, Ed. I do. I bet my career on you. You'd better be good. Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you? That has my work number, my home number, my pager number. I sleep three hours a night. Call me whenever you want to talk. Off the air, on the air, whenever. Okay? I want you to take this. Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you. Ed, can I see you a second. What did you study? I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here. Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go! Good luck. I'm telling you, it's peaked. Ed TV is an over-inflated balloon. Get it off before it explodes all over us. Take him off the air. I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable. He's who we want to go with.I'm a whore! Your bathrooms are filthy! I'm a tramp Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us! Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore! Ed! How did you know I was here? Don't tell Al. He doesn't know. Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex. One thing led to another. He was my husband once. Oh my god! On TV! To you? In front of him? With the... What? Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him -- It was horrible. He called me up. St. Joseph's. He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart. I'm at the hospital. Eddie... Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia. Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie. And what did he come back now for? He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al. This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone. What's the difference? She had white shoes. She could've been a nurse. He... apologized, he begged me. He can be very... charming when it suits his purpose. All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay? I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television! He had girlfriends! Both. Yes. I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts. I can't believe you're taking his side. Oh my God!! Oh my God! Mm. I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"... I know you. This Shari is a passing fancy. No. Maybe he's watching. Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl. He made a mistake. Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend. No. It's a mess. No. Send him away. Are the TV people with you? Eddie? ...So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number. What do we have to do? My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut. You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner. It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship. This is going right up your ass. Everybody's someone. What? The what? No... Could you? No. It's your fault. ...yeah? Yeah... I saw that girl come on to you at the TV show. Are you all right? Okay. I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone. Where? I'm sorry. So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita. I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City. Ed? There's a list. Twenty-nine. A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no." They hate me! Page three of the Post. Look at this. Everybody hates me! I have no privacy. Even now! I'm crying and I can't stop and they won't go away. And now it's going to be another month! Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other. ... yeah, then, but... I really like you too... I know, I ... I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away. Um... Why? That's lucky. Oh yeah. The what? You should see the one we wear when it rains. Yeah, well... What are you doing? Oh God, this is so weird. Me too. I mean I'm going out with Ray and I'm... thinking about you. Really? Go! Leave. Go. I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television! Oh my God. Really? I mean bad. I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him. Ha! Don't defend that horse's ass to me. What do you want?! Right. Dynamite is dangerous. So? Cream rinse? Why do it? Are you sure about this? Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me. Yeah... By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X. What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this? By the X. Sign here, please.I love you! 1 want to marry you! Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph. Who's Shari? Ray, where do you keep the glasses? Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude. Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out. That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.Okay, Jim. I understand. Walt needs to see you. Uh, Jim?El/ella - Tu Yo --I was lonely. You took advantage We made a mistake. Let's not make it worse. Don't say that. You know it's not true. Yeah. I'm here. What do you want, Jim? Three twenty-five. Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter. Take me to that motel. Like you wanted. Hey Yeah? Yep. All his life. He's tried everything. Did you know Dave's a bed wetter? Dave. Oh. Should we get a what? You sure? I can't afford this stuff right now. More this way. Could you get this? I can't Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows. Thank you. What do you mean? What kind of person am I? No, I'm not. I'm just really busy. what? One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults. I hope so I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college. Take as much room as you want Would you sign it for me? I just have to get something. I'll be right back. I want you to do something for me. My house. I've got an idea. Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think? Doing what? Yes? That sounds good. Uh-huh. Yeah. Where to? Sporty. Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice. My mother's buying me a new car for college. I'm looking at new cars. Hello, Mr. M. Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor. I told you! I told you! You're going to pay for my banner! What do you mean? Yes? And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present. I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay. Why are you lecturing me? well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that. I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this. I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30. Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications. I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down. Did I do that too? Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious. I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked! If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty. Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him! These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one. Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures. You're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore. Fuck me, Mr. McAllister Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure. You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you? Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one. I can't wait to start campaigning. Thanks for everything. I thought you were supposed to keep them. Aren't you supposed to keep them? Could you approve them now? I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning. Here they are. I got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need! ...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a... Ethics are... I know. Thanks, Mr. M. You know what they say about the early bird. Good morning, Mr. McAllister. Thanks. You too. It was great working with you. Yes, Paul? Can I sign yours too? Paul, will you sign my yearbook? Yeah. Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you. Good luck to you too, Paul. Yeah. Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on. So Mr. McAllister asked you to run. Thought what? You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president? Who put you up to this? Who put you up to this?I'm going to get him, I promise you. Too late now. He's on to something bigger. I'm in the middle. I'll send you a postcard. Got to go. Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing. You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead. I don't know, but close. We're getting close. This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone. And a target guaranteed to catch his interest. I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor. I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot. It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it. We've got to catch him in the act. Yeah. Me. They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now? You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not. Mac's signature. Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them. Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake. Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao. He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor. Bingo. Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm. Through a window. I don't recall asking your permission. I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers? There are times when you don't answer the phone. You gave them the eight billion. He looks familiar. --You're a cop. My god-- What about you? But-- What's wrong. I'm not leaving without you. No, you can't. Hang on. No way. Jesus. The door's the only way out! We can't help it, we...we've gotta... MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F... We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!! FUCKING THING!!! Jesus God, it's going through. China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight... The sign of our partnership. I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too. I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do. Not for me. That's because you grew up rich. Four billion dollars. So what are you going to do with your share? Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention. But would you--would you-- It was wrong to deceive you. You have something in mind? Can't break tradition. It's bad luck. No. You'll see when we get inside. Surgically attached. Parachute. Pulse detectors. Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank. Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour... How do I look? Feeling old? Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times. I've covered everything. And you're the best, so-- There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises. That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us. We're doing it tonight. That's where the Mask comes in. Got it. The oscilloscope's already programmed. Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it. Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6. Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it. It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change. Peoples China Bank. Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them. The eight billion. From them to us. Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer. You're being useless. I'm making us rich. My job, my rules. Oh my god, I thought-- Do you know what you've done!? Do you know? The Mask. Where is it? There's food in the fridge. I won't be long. Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets. I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue. I'll need the Rembrandt now. Everything. I always knew you'd do the job. Hold the record. Alone. My eighty, your twenty, smart guy-- Okay, 80-20-- I like banks. That's where the money is. You don't know the half of it. Your share. A billion dollars. The big job. STOP! You're making...mistake. Yes. Yes. No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you. What? We did it. Shut up. Duh. They moved it. Got it. Ready. You can't be too careful. Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance. One, two, three... It's a party. In eye of that painting. Bookshelf. Sensors-- And-- Something like that. He wasn't. My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me. I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay. Terrified. Still am. When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this. To us. To the Mask. Aren't we early? I've got something for you. Won't take any time. No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village. Thank you. You bought this for me? It's---beautiful. That's it. We're ready. Charged. Receiver? Got it. A dozen times. Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve. I didn't mean to get personal. All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like. Hmmm. Did I hear a car? Let's do it again. Why don't we take oxygen? Oh, I think you can do it. Probably. Let's just see how we do. Without the Mask it doesn't matter. We get the Mask I'll tell you. No. It's a down payment. This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy. I'll need that. Someone was expecting that. It was perfect. You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me. I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass. That's because I wanted them to! No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt! You don't have any idea how lucky you are! Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one. You don't get the Mask code unless I go. We're doing this together. We're partners. We go underwater? They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan. In a week. As I recall, you've robbed it before. Nice spot. And good morning. I'm dressed. Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms? Nothing? You don't even lock the door? I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing. I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house. What's my problem? You want a list? I don't believe this. That's entrapment. Where's my bag? You stole my luggage? You-- Those are my clothes. What about your bags? We're going to die, aren't we... It's one way. Motorcycle. You what--? What the hell was that? What the hell do I do now? Not funny. He says they turned the card down. A film case. I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake. But-- It's a fake. How much am I paying? Fine. What do I do? It's a test. I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask. You want me to pick up a painting? Not a word. Maybe I should drive this time. We going somewhere? It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code. You can't. But Roki said-- I know. I suspected it might be worthy of your interest. Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on. The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China. I'm sorry. This just means so much to me. Well, no...but... We were, we are, but this is perfect for you. I've got something for you. No. Why would I be? You...you can't. So alive. I didn't expect you to be so... You're not taking me seriously. I've got something... Excuse me? Like I would have art in my suitcase. Yes. But they don't have a clue. Why would anyone steal my luggage? I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen. That's good. Terrific. Are you...okay? You disappeared. I'll call an ambulance. Uh, yes. Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate... I have a proposal for you. I don't want to waste your time. I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win. Mr. MacDougal. How about if I try humility. It's sold. No you can't. Uh. I'm showing off. Who am I? Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask. You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC. We need to make the trade tomorrow.Who did this to you? My God, you're shot... What happened... ? I'm not paying this back. I consider it "asshole tax." Why are you doing this? Tyler... Leave me alone! I don't ever want to see you again! Let go of me! What?! You're sorry? I don't believe that for a minute. There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore. I just can't. This is killing me... No, no, shut up! I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried... You are an insane person. What? Whatever. I'll take my food to go... What? Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass. You got about thirty seconds. Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie. I've done you enough favors. Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here. I don't want to hear anything you've got to say. Here comes an avalanche of bullshit. The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable. Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm. Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there... What... ? What is wrong with you? You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler? Is that what you're calling it? You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love? Is this a trick? What kind of stupid question is that?! Yeah? What? Can I come in? You're afraid to say. Why would you get bent if I asked? Guy or girl? What is this? Who did this? That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there? Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject? Hear what? What do you get out of it? It was the smart move on her part. Do you care? Chloe's dead. Whatever. Well... thanks, anyway. I could check your prostate. I wish I could return the favor. Well, that's a relief. Thank you. You feel nothing? Make sure. Feel anything? Here. Here. Good. Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any? Please. Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor. You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up. Don't worry, I'm leaving. Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape. I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar. What... ? Do you want to wait to hear me describe death? This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things. Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much. I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people? Like testicular cancer? Really? You haven't been going to yours. The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups. Where have you been the last few weeks? I suppose. Should we? Looks like this is goodbye. Deal. That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh? So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer. So far, you have four and I only have two! I want that. I want brain parasites. I'll take the parasites. I don't know -- am I? Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls. You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all. Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem. Really? -- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. A year? How'd you manage that? It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee. Go ahead. I'll expose you. Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped... ? "... Mr. Taylor." And I saw you practicing this... What? Sure.Okay: this may sound crazy, but -- But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it! -- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger. -- the whole thing is falling apart! -- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now -- So we don't even know if she's alive or dead -- -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr? So what stopped her? -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger -- -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!" And what's Steven's status? You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then. No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do. Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth. We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce. Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me. Steven?? No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house <b>IS</b> haunted. -- wit...nesses -- -- what...are...you...going...to -- Steven -- Funky little house, ain't it? Friends, your hostess is now going to retire for what's left of the night. If you need me, I'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need: the door'll be locked, I'll be trying to sleep, and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole, I'm gonna empty this thing into their fucking head. Thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have. Question answered. -- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table! -- oh, for chrissake, that's a given; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here -- -- and who's next on your list? I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch -- Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr? Stalking the wild poltergeist. Fine with me. Just somebody then better go and round up Melissa Marr. And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies? So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby? Must be getting old, Stevie -- you're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the Son-Of-Sam Hunt back in '94. Girlie, open up that casket there and see what you find. -- the sadistic prick -- Really? Well, let it rip. Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once. My guests were shredded. It's your sick little scene now, Steven: enjoy. I'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me, and then I'm calling a cab. You're hurting me. Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men? All accidents until proven otherwise. It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds. What are you talking about? You think I invited them? Then who are they? I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win. I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they? Could we have a word? Haven't they already? I'm not laughing, Steven. Don't touch me! Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --C'mon. -- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me. More the merrier. Yeah...something. -- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself? Looks like we're it. What? I don't do groups. Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones. Run. All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down. No. It's just trying to frighten us. The opening's still too small, we'll never get through! -- was that?? We're safe? He's dead...? He's gotta still be down here. It'll have to do. What about that other guy? Or an on-line computer. Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us... Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here! Cheery looking bunch. Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work. Let's try down here... Back where? -- listen to the man -- -- where the hell were you? I was upstairs with Eddie -- You're starting to sound like Pritchett. -- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there -- It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop! We can do it... No -- keep pulling, it's moving! An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping. Hey, if everybody's gonna kill each other, could you do it in another room? I'm trying to get something accomplished here. No...not air -- There's always exceptions. Why not? I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of -- What? Deep down inside? You need to get out more. Thanks. This whole place can't be wired to just one circuit -- Three steps forward -- I want to get up there. Don't push it. And you're not really as large and useless as you seem. Is she...alright? ...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ? What? No, no, it's just -- I was in the middle of -- Messenger just dropped it off. No return address. I don't know, Ms. Jenzen. Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price. Don't think so. Stay the fuck back. -- no more -- -- confirming everything we already know -- I'll take my chances. Well, I don't. Fascinated. If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now. I never saw you -- -- the window and door grates -- I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body. What is it?? Good way to get your head blown off. This is all maybe getting a little too strange -- Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures. What're you talking about? Yeah. Why's there five checks? There's only four of us. -- hey! -- How, he's supposed to be dead! Pritchett: what is going on? Price! Excuse me? You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn? Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"? There is something very not normal going on here! And you think it's in there? Ghosts killed your father? You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives. Well, that leaves you with two options then, doesn't it: either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it's spend-the-night-sleep-tight. No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <b>reverse</b> on this thing and floor it. Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place? Uh, excuse me? Don't think I'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that's your marriage -- but this isn't what I had in mind... I want to know that we can get out of here if we need to. Why not? Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone? What's going on? Of course he did, for God's sake. Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett? -- guess we know where Mr. Price is now. But the million bucks each, that's for real? -- I'm coming -- Keep talking, I'll find you! Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you? Melissa...? -- Eddie!!Yeah. Thanks to you. Yeah, you got bit. I'm gonna fix it. You're gonna be okay. You're not okay, your leg's a mess. And how would we neutralize him? They could try to tranq him on land. What? Can I tell them you won't go back in the water? No. Oh, bullshit. I'm no psychiatrist. But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than-- Excuse me? Hector. What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on. Did you want to be killed by it? Jack ! Scales were oval. It was an Asian crocodile. He was an Indo-pacific. What? Oh as if I'm interested. I'm just saying last resort. You should take a flax pole. U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation. None of us actually saw anything. I realize this Sir, but something flipped us over, I doubt very much it was a mink. Hector . But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway. I never had sex with you! Hector. The big one has no sense of humor. And since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self. Good thinking. Probably not. You think? No. Different worlds, Jack. Likewise. But we do. Hey, we'll always have Maine. Yeah. No, I actually want to stay for a little while. Well... He heeds a tourniquet. He's through fighting. Look at him. We gotta get to Hector!! Hector!! Watch out!! He's mooing. He's floating. Take it home. He has been going after everything. It could work. But this is not a happy cow. Well... Good idea. Okay. Alright, Jack! What? You calm down! No . I keep getting hit with heads! That is it !! I'm not mushing it . I'm not mushing it. Thing we can lift it? What? I'm gonna get ticks. I know it. They're drawn to me. I got a thing about ticks. We seem to say goodnight a lot. Night. Maybe. I've always read about what's happened. I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening. What? Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would... Does it show? Keep it dry. No swimming. Father's a surgeon. I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here. Just gotta pull it a little tighter. It's okay. I wonder if he's some kind of mutant. That bear had to be surprised. Yeah. I got some stuff for your cut. Why he's that big , I don't know. Why he's here ... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving. Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans. A man just died, you're hitting on me with science. You did , you-- Nice? Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good. Gee, that was so poetic, Jack. I'm all moist. What are you talking about? Excuse me? Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness. Um... y'know... Yeah. That's probably good. Yeah. Nobody saw anything ? Good luck. They respond pretty quick. I'll wait till you get down before I turn it on. In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. He's a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits. Good. That was an awful thing to say to me. I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of-- I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows-- I am not staying on shore. I beg your pardon? Skipping stones. Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one. I'd be able to see something. Because they just consult their little indigenous charts. Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there... Something's in that water. There have been Northern sightings. But not this North. Hector Cyr. He's a rich kook mythology professor. He's done some work with our museum. He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles. If this is who I think it is. It is . Oh my God. I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks. I'm not making it up. So I don't like tents, why-- How would you know, what-- I told you. I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene. I never believed it. It really is beautiful, isn't it? And they're sure he didn't get tangled under the outboard somehow? How big do the bears get? Excuse me. One other thing, it's a small point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by him , but you seemed quick to join in. Yes, it did seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck. Not that it worked , obviously. It probably somehow got lodged into his body. Are we all museum bigots in Maine? Kelly Scott. I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch? Wait. Did you get him? Such a simple idea and it's working. What does that tell you? If he gets close, you go up , Hector, don't you endanger that cow. Look ten feet into the water. What is she doing now ? Mother of God . Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Hank! Are you okay? Hank? I think. My hair. Where's Hector?! Where is he? What was that? That was a bust. Well. He's probably rugged handsome I guess. Yeah. What is this? Well Hector's a giant cracker. What ? I don't even know the guy. He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes. He may be a kook but he's also been all over the world with them. He even swam in the Grimetti with killer Niles all around him, he never got nipped. I asked you to be nice to him. I'm sorry. It's to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter. You hurt his feelings. I think you should go apologize. Thank you, it's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you Fucker. Crocodiles. He's an expert on them. And if he's here ... then he must think that's what's in this lake. You threw it at me!! It looks like a branch. What? Yes, camp , I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets? We're staying in tents ? Gee. What is with this lake? It looks black and... there are no waves or anything. Sheriff. We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick? It's just that-- And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia? What is that ? Ever even been in one? You have a thing against museums? What? What kind of backup do we have? You talk to the married couple? Okay. And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit? And this is how he came to the boat? This... how long did this attack go on for? I can look at dead things. Well. At wakes. I'm fine, thank you. Um. No, no. Let's go. Is the dead guy in there? There ? That's the morgue. And you didn't see anything ? Did he say anything? I am not going to Maine . That's ridiculous. I never do field work and even if I did, Maine , to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something-- This was Myra's idea, wasn't it? Get me out of the office for a few days, until-- I'm not even a field person. I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street-- Are you on drugs? This is what we do? Sorry? Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else? A tooth? Kevin. How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out. Yes, well... famished. Oh ... No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm... I actually have an early lunch, so... Oh. Oh. That's okay. Well. This uh... this probably wasn't meant to be, y'know. I mean, I'm... God, I gotta be ten years younger and you, you ... you're y'know... Yeah, that part. There's... somebody who's um... Kevin, as long as we... What was that last part? I was working for you when "us" started, what's-- That's not what you came to say. Me too. Absolutely. Kevin, hey. I really... I should get back. Myra. No. I'm not upset, Myra, okay. I just never thought of you as a y'know... You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words. You and Kevin. You ? You ? Really? I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else? I don't like to be scared, Myra, I have a thing about fright, don't ever scare me. Well you shouldn't have. How did you even know where I was. What do you expect, mugging me from behind?GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. GET OUT. YOU BURN IN BELL. You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT. I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby -- FUCK YOU. YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT. GET THE FUCK OUT. Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house -- I'M NOT CRAZY. You're the one. You're the one who's wrong. You're the one -- I'M NOT CRAZY. Don't you tell me I'm crazy. Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE? Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore? I don't wanna talk to you. Don't sit down. What the fuck do you want? Wanna call me a slut now, something? He's not my boyfriend. What do you want? Why are you here? ...what the fuck is this...? just let me walk out, ok? Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please. Just say no. ....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again? Wanna kiss me, Jim? Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck. I've got troubles. You don't know how crazy I am. You don't how fuckin' stupid I am. That was so great what you just said. Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so -- What? You're a police officer. You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems. I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon. That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me -- Can I tell you something? That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do. ok. I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just -- I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes -- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know -- I'm sorry -- What? Ok. I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people.... To not do that. To not do that that we've maybe done -- before -- What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something... You wanna make a deal with me? And I bet you say that to all the girls -- Why not? So you've done it -- Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything -- Great, bye. It's my favorite place -- Billingsley's? Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good. Should I get dressed up or -- ? Eight o'clock? Do you wanna go tonight? I mean, are you working? I thought you were flirting with me a little. Really? Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do? Well...is that illegal? You wanna go on a date with me? What is it? Did you forget something? Good bye. yeah, good, ok. Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you Officer Jim. I'm sorry. If you're not here for a 422 -- We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started. Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched -- --- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically. Thank you. Ok, ok. I'm back. I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick. You won't. You won't have to. It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over. Really. It's not. He won't came back. It's not -- what's a 422? -- is not my boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. Yeah. You take cream or sugar? I don't know how fresh it's gonna be -- -- do you wanna cup? Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit -- I don't have a boyfriend. Yeah. Yeah. About two years ago. ok. What are you lookin' for? It's fine. I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know -- No. No. Yes. I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left. I'm sorry. No. Yeah. I didn't realize it was that loud. No. Yeah, but I don't know -- What? Wilson. I'm sorry. For what? Yes. I'm sorry, I had to get dressed. I'm coming! uh...uh...What is it? ...Hello...?Yep. Yeah. You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here. No. I think you have the wrong number. Hello?Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms? Kind of. They wouldn't? Ok. That's why. I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment -- And "Frank?" It's not your given name, right? Where does that name come from? And you went to Van Nuys High, right? In five years? Do you have your masters? Psychology major? And you ended up at UC Berkely -- I wouldn'tve asked -- I'm sorry. And your father? What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy." Are you close? Does you mother still work? Why does that sound silly? And what did your parents do? the valley? Where are you from originally?You're hurting a lot of people, Frank -- So you sat it out, that's what you did? Yeah. C'mon, Frank. What are you doing? I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980. I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young -- No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question -- She lived in Tarzana. She does. From when you were a boy. Do you remember a Miss Simms? We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand -- It's not like I'm trying to attack you -- It's all important -- I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are -- Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become -- Are you asking me that? This isn't meant -- I would just want to clear some things up: -- just to clarify -- I'm confused about your past is the thing. -- let's talk more about your background -- It's fine. I can bleep it out. Let's talk about -- -- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley -- Ok. So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start -- I'm gonna start rolling -- All it takes is one second? If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs -- That's fine. It's nice to meet you.-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- I need to sit down. I'm listening. I'm getting better. -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts -- Yeah. He has Phil right now. I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me practical things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then What? -- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down? Shut the fuck up. I have to go. Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it. -- that can't happen. Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things. What does that mean? Where will the money go? I can't. This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around. I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done.. I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going. No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand? I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments... I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then? -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to --- Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing -- If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand? No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things -- Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know. listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand? y'know? I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just... BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM. You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of my family. this is the family , me and him do you understand? You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. That man, his son does not exist. HE IS DEAD. HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT? PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP. Hang up the phone. What are you doing?

THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM. THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE! THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM. WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE -- I don't have to do a god damn thing. I didn't hear anything. It's ten o'clock in the morning -- No. No. Mischief? What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief? It's a free country, you can think anything you want. I went out last night. I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around -- I don't know a loud crash. I didn't do anything. I preffer to stand. Marcie. No I Said. I live alone. No. I said that. You're here. What does it look like? I don't have to answer your questions. I AM CALM. You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't -- There's no disturbance. There's no disturbance. I am calm. You're just come in -- You can't just come in here. What? What? What now?Total is $15.29. Thirty minutes or less. Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ? yeah, I said.

You deserve to die alone for what you've done. Yes you do....you do and you won't say. But you can't say.... ...Jimmy... Jimmy, did you touch her? Did you ever touch her? I'm asking you. I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me. ...say it, Jimmy... I think that you know. Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy? I'm not through asking my questions. I'm not mad. I am, but I'm not. Y'know? Do you feel better now that you've said this? Well maybe. Do you have any children with anyone? Is it over 'cause you're sick? What about now? How long with Paula? How long with Ellen? No one else that I know? hey. Who? Was there anyone that I know? I don't hate you, Jimmy. But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask.... How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say... Yeah. The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me? ...No...I don't hate you. Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy? You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins? Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble -- No. No. You're my handsome man. We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess... It'll take the pain away. Bye. I love you. Did you tell her? -- did she talk to you? Come home soon after the show. Slowly or quickly? How you doing?You're NOT DYING! How can you be so casual??! Have you told your family? Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it? Andy... there is no real you. Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated. I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate. It's me. Then stop treating me like a fucking prop. Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble?? No! YOU get in the kitchen. I'm gonna make you dry my dishes! And all this will be for real? Why Memphis? Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married? I'm here, ain't I? You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television. Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. Andy, the theater's that way! No thanks. Hi... am I late? Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you. Andy, the theater's that way! No thanks. Hi... am I late? Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole. Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.You're going to have to make a final choice. In one hand, you will have Morpheus' life. In the other hand, you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one, will be up to you. Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise. He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours. I know. Poor Morpheus. Without him we are lost. We will never find the One. What's funny? Your next life, maybe. Who knows. That's how these things go. Sorry, kid. You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something. But you already know what I'm going to tell you. Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say -- So? What do you think? You think you're the One? Not too bright though. You're cuter than I thought. I see why she likes you. I said don't worry about it. I'll get one of my kids to fix it. That vase. I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway. And don't worry about the vase. Bingo. Not quite what you were expecting, right? I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip. Almost done. Smell good, don't they? I know. You're Neo. Be right with you.... yes. Goddamn you, Cypher! But you're out, Cypher. You can't go back. The Matrix isn't real! My God. Morpheus. You gave them Morpheus. You killed them. An accident?! Cypher? Where's Tank? Morpheus will take him when he's ready. Don't tell me you're a believer now? Are you sure this line is clean? Did you hear that? If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus. I... it doesn't matter what I believe. Morpheus believes he is the One. Don't be ridiculous. I know but I felt like taking a shift. You can't use that until Neo is out! How long? What is he doing? They'll be able to track it. What if he isn't the One, Morpheus? How can you be so sure? I got a fibrillation! All right -- Goddamnit! Are they any agent? Not yet. Are you all right? You moved like they moved. I've never seen anyone move that fast. Neo, how did you do that? No one has ever done anything like this. No? Let me tell you what I believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else. I'm coming with you. What? Because... No, Neo. That's not true. It can't be true. No, you... have to be. What? Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out! There's no way you're going back in! You can't! What are you doing? What choice? Goddamnit! Goddamnit! What happened? Is Morpheus still alive, Tank? We have to! Go! A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something. How much like it? Was it the same cat? What happened? What did you see? What did you just say? Are you all right? She told me... Yes. No. Are you worried? That's different. That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are. What? It disables any electrical system in the blast radius. It's the only weapon we have against the machines. Easy, Neo. Easy. It's going into replication. We think you're bugged. Try to relax. And I know that's not where you want to be. Because you've been down there, Neo. You already know that road. You know exactly where it ends. Neo, please, you have to trust me. From you. It's necessary, Neo. For our protection. When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it. It's the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did. It is a hacker's question. Please. Just listen. I know why you're here, Neo. I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city. You're looking for him. They're watching you, Neo. Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you. No. It's safe here and I don't have much time. Most guys do. What? That was a long time ago. My name is Trinity. I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time. Hello, Neo. Hurry, Neo. What just happened? An Agent! You have to send me back! Neo! Tank, I need a pilot program for a military M-109 helicopter. You're going to kill him? Kill Morpheus?! Dozer? Tank, you're hurt. Got it. Cypher, I thought -- We need an exit! He's alive. Tank, it's me.It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it. Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried. I'm late for lab. Remember, that poet that we liked � the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets. No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you. Hey, where's your sweatshirt? Exactly. Yes, it's lame. Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame. I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die? Sometimes I wonder what they talk about. That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group. This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique-- Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge. NASA. Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other. How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year. Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus? Sure. No problem. Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974. Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist. I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table. Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know. : Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat? Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot. Nice. Well, do you? guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now- When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase. Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.Nope. Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help? You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you. Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation. Gus, have you ever been in love? YOU KNIT? Oh, man! Who told? Well excuse me. OH! How about "Under the Sea?" Right. Right. I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over already. If you say so. Well. I like a man who gets to the point. It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you. You need my help? Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you? Hi! Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast! And we're going to have to do something about your hair. Cuuuute! I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady. Bridgework? So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one. Now this is cute. Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation. Okay. That's bad. Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes. So, you were a geek. Big deal. Senorita Josie. Jos, that's not what we're -- No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin! Jos - Maybe you should turn it down. Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear. Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion. Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy� If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye. Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?! I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date? You stood for like a month. Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it? And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can? Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure. Who told! Guess who I did it with last night...Well I'm so glad that you guys are. Oh. I forgot. What? Right. 7:30. � uhh, must have forgotten- Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around? It is? Have you ever wanted to go to The Court? Yeah, I know. What's that? Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once. What is with this school and prom? College? Petty good. Thanks. So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be? Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom. Oh I know. Yeah. Let's do that. Why do they listen to Guy? How long will they watch us for? Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse." What? Never mind. That is so awful that they hide your cars. Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat. I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name. Wow. It's packed. No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own. Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do. Anita! 'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing. How about this? Very romantic. What'd you feel when you kissed him? That is lingerie. At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool. The girls threw them at me in the locker room. Anita, remember espadrilles? And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles? Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs? Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this. You don't think I can do it. My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller". I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing-- When I finally get kissed, I'll know. The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him. Anita! I'm concentrating on my career right now. Forget it. Yeah. Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex. You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him." Roger in Op/Ed. I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus. Wings? What is this? George! What are you doing here? Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare? Betty. Do I want to be crunched? Why? Transitioned? Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft. That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day. Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story. You already pitched this to Rigfort?! There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me. He's my teacher! You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No. What if I say no? Gus? Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural. They hid my car-- Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this. Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session-- Uhh, no. Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go. Kristen got a quote? Oh. Right. Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf-- It's an expose on cafeteria food. It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too. But I don't want it straightened out. Hey--I can be out of control. You don't think I can grab bulls' balls? A--flack jacket. They don't have to be in the office Christmas show? You've done five of my ideas. Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good. Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk? Five-- Six-- Well, excuse me for caring about words. It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings. You said that already. Oh. Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". What about you? What are you thinking about? Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her. You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo. Yes. I'll go. Yes. Maybe we should go in a different room? Hey. There. Rob's? Oh my god. Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes! Hey Rob, what's going on? You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives. Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person. Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas. I- wasn't even thinking about- Really? Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought-- Thanks. And what are - Rufus? She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal. Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen. Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day. You're twenty-three years old! Are you crazy?! You can't do this. I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare. Better than I... Yes, desperately. Is that true? Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular? Rob. Please focus. Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South. Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible. I can't do this. Good. Are mom and dad here? Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God. Josie Grossie. It was a long time ago - What!? I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school. I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre. It's just for a couple of months. For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life! How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills? This--this is a luau that sells packing material! I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and-- Better person than I. Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal. Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do. Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you. That is so--weird that you name your car. I finally found my story. Please. Please don't walk away. I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again. I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person! But now you don't have to-- Wait, I was going to tell you-- You were attracted to me? No, surprise, I thought you'd be-- Yeah, I have. It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you? Well, are you here with anybody? Thanks. So do you. Wow. You believe in me that much-- Oh--yikes! What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college-- Do you think you'll find her? To put us back together again when we fall. That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us-- But Humpty Dumpty was alone. Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee? When are you going to open your eyes? You have to say that. You're my teacher. That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to-- Why do you do that? I know. I don't have to say that. You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom. That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher. Don't look down! Of course. I remember everything from your class. Oh right. The Spiderman incident. You're afraid of the Ferris wheel. Are you--scared? Thank you. Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear. Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. We just go right into sheep herding. College. Haven't really thought about it. Thank you. Oh I don't think so. Well, I'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late-- Sure, why? But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right? I love the way she writes. Dorothy Parker-- Sorry. Forgetful. I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie. The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom. Why? What?Lovely to meet you. I'm a vegetarian. I wonder if you could tell me where the...? Hi. Night, night, Honey. You're right. I told you I was bad at acting. And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. That was such a great evening. Well... a shot at it. Wait a minute. What about me? Oh... no one... no one. Just some... guy from the past. I don't know what he's doing here. Bit of an awkward situation. And then I... right. So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...? I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet. I'm not listening. We have to. I've got to be in New York on Thursday. Fifteen million dollars. Films mainly. Well, they can be. I'm an actress. Yes, I'm pretty sure I would. I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't. Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision. I see. That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it? ... Yes, that's fine. Of course. I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you. That's fine. There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict. You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England? Yes. The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again. I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice. So it's been just sitting in the hotel. But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ... No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed. I thought I'd give it to you. Oh no. It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is... Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and... Well... how have you been? You disappeared. Hi. Drink tea -- there's lots of tea. But... wait... there are things to say. It's not going very well -- and it's our last day. I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to... This is certainly... ah... You really don't get it. This story gets filed. Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos. Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. Excuse me? You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes. Our perspectives are different. And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner. Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal. I don't want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to go home. Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott. You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into will know. 'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.' As far as they're concerned I do. And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu. This is such a mess. I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again. For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. Really? The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is. She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.' And then you go out in your goddamn underwear. I do. Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was. How do you think I'm doing? Jesus. Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed like that? What? Damn, I forgot the jam. Can I stay a bit longer? Oh. Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me? Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that? But... they're odd-looking. They're for milk. Your mum's got them. You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about? No seriously. I mean, they're just breasts. Every second person in the world has got them... What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them? You and every person in this country. What? Okay. Right. Today has ben a good day. Which under the circumstances is... unexpected. Both. Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he? It's delicious. Definitely. Ths is important stuff. I could have a stunt bottom, yes. Definitely. 'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.' The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses. Big feet -- large shoes. You know what they say about men with big feet? You've got big feet. Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat. I do. It feels like how being in love should be. Floating through a dark blue sky. Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.' You think I should do Henry James instead? What do you think? Well, get a message through to him too. My son's name is Johnny? 'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.' Damn. 'And Wainwright...' 'Thank you.' How many mistake did I make? 'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives. I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster. Would you? It's all talk, talk, talk. Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday. Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster. I have thought about you. I don't know. It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you... and love? I'm really sorry about last time. He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again. A bath would be great. These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like... Thank you. I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. I don't know where to go. The hotel is surrounded. Hi. Can I come in? I'm sorry... I don't know what to say. Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room. You've got to go. There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come up? Here we are. Do you want to come up? I don't know either. I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you? I shouldn't have done that. I shouldn't have done that. No, that's fine. I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same. Uh-oh. That's not good. Why? So who left who? Step aside. There's no 'unless.' No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets. You said 'whoopsidaisies.' Yes, you did. What did you say? You abide by rules like that? Let's go in. I was. Busy tomorrow? Too complicated. And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? Why is she in a wheelchair? Floppy, huh? Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade. I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this... Okay. If that's all right. No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date. Okay -- fine. Ahm. That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more. I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice. Yes. And what happens next in the dream? No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I seriously don't know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space. No, it's a stupid privacy thing. I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi. Hello. Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try. Four o'clock could be good. Oh -- Okay. You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call. Hi. Bye. Probably best not tell anyone about this. Don't worry about it. I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint. Thanks. Well... I forgot my bag. Thank you. No. I better be going. Thanks for your help. No. Really, no. No. No thanks. Okay. So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards. No thank you. I need to get my car back. Oh Jesus. No, that's fine. I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see. Thanks. I'll think about it. Really? No, thanks. I'll just look around. I haven't decided. Nice surprise. Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job. Yes... Tempting but... no, thank you. Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.' What's your name? Yes. Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.' I can't say I know Patrick all that well. Is that right?Di Caprio. Working with Leonardo. No -- it's my 22nd.Yes. Right. I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic. I'm not running. You don't understand this guy. At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me? Bob -- are you making friends with this man? What is he up to now? Of course. Of course. I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian. Weird. Like after all those years you would remem-- God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm... Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next. Good one! Thanks. And what did you say? What did he ask? What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest? He's here!... He's here! It's hurting. Eight is good... "V" could be Victory. Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully. I borrowed it from this guy I know. So? "I guarantee that we'll have tough times. I guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me". I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part. And I've been practicing it. Ready? They're mine. I'm turning in my running shoes to you. I didn't. And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that. I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me. I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things. It's something I've always wanted to do. I've been making friends with your cat. Is it okay that I'm here? So, we'll... I'm okay with that. And the church. Yes, you! To who? Are you asking me? I love you, too. Me, either. Okay. So... what, uh... What just happened? Just now? Jus then? In there? Really? About a minute...? I kissed him back. Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect. Hey. No. No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor. Yes I do! That's called changing your mind. What!? Lost! Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand. Brian told you that? I already explained about that. That was very interesting research George was doing! It's fun! It's high. I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me. You humiliated me! Yes. Excuse me? Where did you disappear to? Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything. Yeah. It's kind of nice. Wrenches. My dad's gonna love that one. First I have to find some tools. I need a half and a nine-six-tenth. Your filter's clogged. This takes unleaded. Watch your leg, Dad. I'm so tired of this. No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible. No. You take it. It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust. Ike... Hi, Grandma. You know, there's no... What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm? I'll have the same. Fine. The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine. Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress. Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that? You don't know. Now that's romantic. A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong? So? Is that what you said to her? What do you mean? It was incredibly romantic! It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. Cal Ripken even applauded. He's an entomologist! I thought it was very unique. Still sweet. What an incredible chauvinistic observation. No, I'm not afraid. Just... Maybe someday. Maybe someday. I think so. It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in. Six-fifty. Seven-fifty. Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing. Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical? Actually, I meant you. You probably got severance or expenses or both. I'll take your check. No credit cards. My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth. You're welcome. Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction. Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud. How do I do it? I'm not that beautiful. You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? He is not! Give me that! Grandma made me the cutest outfit. I can't wait to show it to you. We think so. Without oxygen... Twice... Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose. And I have no intention of doing it again. I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work. I still have my job. You're going to be very disappointed. Did something happen to make you care about reality? You have one? Yes. Nervous? Not at all! No. I've never been more certain in my life. Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams. Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it. Excellent. I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered. Thank you. You still think that he was.... What are you talking about? No, I'm just going to head home. I'm just finishing up, too. No sauntering down the aisle. Just make time. Let's just get there. You and your lucky geese. You always see geese. He's not coming. Watch. He's not coming. Grandma! ... I don't even want to talk about the luau. What's this? Yep. I want him to be front and center and to watch everything. I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was. Lighten up, what? Thanks. Will you fix my hair? It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore. I think you're right. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you? Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness. But I'm weird. But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious! Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out". I'm going to kill myself. On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move? Thank you. Do you think I flirt with Cory? Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things. There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg. Ya think? That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot. Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me. She's the boss. Reporter? I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid. Yes, I've seen it. And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me! No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room. No. It's my life. Just stop it. Don't say another word like that. Thank you, Dad. His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady. I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady. Not this one. This one's on me.It's okay. There's no microphone. You're no fun. Tootaloo. Oh, I will. I'm not sure. Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't. He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her. I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say. It's her fourth time to the altar, you know. Not seven like they said. Excuse me, sir. I have an actual fact for you. Maybe she hasn't read the paper... You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet. No, no. You're her best friend. You tell Maggie. "And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance. So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground" Holy moly.Oh, come on. You're practically family. You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick. Your two cinnamon rolls. -- The luau for Maggie. Betty Trout. Five dollars.Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate. His hair... any color. "Never say die." "Make the shot." Don't be nervous, Maggie. Let us visualize. Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball." Bob is making her visualize the ceremony. Oh, sure. That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men... This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know. Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"? No, she's talking about your hair. Yep. Maggie -- Someone to see you. And you are? Peggy Phleming. Not the ice skater. No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired. It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie. Are you a reporter? Quick. Very quick. Wedding. Wedding. You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row. Okay. Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something? You okay? I'm closing. Let's go. Not eight... No, no. I saw eight geese flying in a "V". See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it. It's for the bell. What happened at the luau? He's going to be the pastor? Would it? This party is for you and Bob. Get your mind off the reporter. Lighten up, wahine. You're right. It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up. Something that brings warmth to my heart. Duckbill platypus. I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one. No. You're quirky. Quirky and weird are two different things. No. I'm weird. Weird and mysterious are two different things. No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery. Why? I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves. Yes. Good morning to you, too. You look good. He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man. Where? Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky! It's probably because you got him fired. For what reason? Some personal satisfaction? Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut. Yup! Stop it. When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me. You're a goddess! So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh? Yeah. No. No, you tell her. "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them. She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.I... I can't do this. Quickly, close it. Ichabod... What was that? The church. Where are we going? Speak the words, Constable. What is stopping you? What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality? Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out. If you think I am behind this, say it. Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them. I have not been able to face him yet. He did not do these things. If you knew him, you would realize... When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it. I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself. I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry. I found it too fascinating to resist. I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity. Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said. What is so urgent? I'm drawing bad blood from the wound. The skull is gone. My God... what has happened? What are you doing? What did you say? But, I am not alone, am I? I only wished to see what you were up to, and... To thank you. I apologize if I worried you. It is only me. If you want me to go, I will. Do you want me to leave? She died. Her lungs were diseased... two years ago. What is this about? No, but... why do you ask that? What? What has happened? The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them. What troubles you? You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it. Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it. But, why? Tell me why. Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane. He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand. But, what do you want? What is it then? Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest? And this gives worth to butchery? Must I hear this? What are you on about? I have misjudged you I think. I did not imagine you were so cruel. Why would you do such a thing? Won't they still have that justice? Or, was it a vain promise? People have put their trust in you. You promised justice. That would be a pity. Those words might show you something you've never seen before. I insist that you have it. Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny. Oh, you are hopeless. May I keep it at least? Don't you see why? Look closely a moment. Put your intellect aside. Can't you see what is inexplicable? You made this, and the drawings? Yes, he does. May I try? It would be interesting to find out. These scars. How did you get them? You pay great attention to small things. I hide these as I hide all my books. Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible. You do not disturb me. Please stay. Having trouble sleeping? You are funny. Really? Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop? To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black. Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons. Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute. And, still others believe none of it. I've read a great deal about your New York City. Do be a dear and tell me all about it. Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life. He has proposed to me twice. My suitor? Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women? It might have been more. Might have been positively grand talk. Other people? Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. I'll leave you to your business. You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you? Did they tell? It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone. According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day. Forgive me, I didn't know. No one will believe your lies, whore. Father saw you die. You... you are alive. Lay still, Ichabod. Do not move.You're implying th... It seems human. To me. We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake. Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people believe is true. Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder. We discussed that. And decided not to. Yes, and then, what was there to call about? Everything was up in the air. Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong. Closer to eight. We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later. Happy for him. And relieved. I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed. It's not for the. They only get to convict him. Did you write that column? You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There's no half- way. As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go. I'm married, Ishmael. It isn't right for us to be alone. People will t... I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor... I don't mean everyone. Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a newspaper. Look at my face. It's the face of the people who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We're in bad trouble, you have to see that. My father can't get our money from the bank. We have a few dol... I lie to my parents every day. And every night. I can just feel my spirits soar. My mom. Would be the problem. We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword. Easy. Slow is best. He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more.Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much... Eric?! Eric, what is it?! Sure, hon. Goodnight. Yes, hon? Oh. I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh? Goodnight, honey. Eric! Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way! Look, Eric it's your little friends. Eric? Oh, he said rim job. It's when someone licks your ass for- You bastards. What?The Canadians are just mad that we mothers here in South Park have the chutzpah to stand up to them! Like it or not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children are now safe from your Canadian smut! BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!! YOU JUST DON'T CARE! Oh but OF COURSE children are going to see it!! Kyle?! I know what it is! What was that word, young man!? This is it! The time for action is NOW!! <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b> Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases! KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!! Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences. No... The General is right. You boys need help. There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language. Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion. Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU! Do as I say, Kyle! Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you! Shiteater- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals! Wake up, people! We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals? YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!! I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN! I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?! What is 'fisting'? I'm needing lunch. And Bill? Well find out where that signal is coming from! Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost! Not necessary?! Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!! We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers. It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil! What about air strikes? My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada. Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time. Oh God... What have I done... And I thought my mother was the master of guilt. Geez Louise. Oh. Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz! What the hell is going on?! You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school! Yes Principal Victoria. The PTA is impeaching you. Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft? As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code. We must take action on this immediately. Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage. Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children! Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again! The F word?! What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word? I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation. Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization. What do you mean MOST, why not ALL? How is the children's progress? This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!-Or monkey fucker- We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!! Oh Lord, what have we done...? Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children! He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny. Oh dear God...No one could. No one lives any nearer than town. -- no one could. No one lives any nearer than town. No one will come any nearer than that. In the night. In the dark. It's a job. I keep banker's hours. I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six. You can serve yourselves. Breakfast is ready at nine. I don't wait on people. I don't stay after dinner. Not after it begins to get dark. I leave before dark comes. We live in town. Nine miles. So there won't be anyone around if you need help. We couldn't even hear you, in the night. I've seen 'em. Lot to dust. So far. It's make the soup or answer the door. Can't do both.Is this true? I've been hypnotized? Welcome Home Eleanor. Welcome Home? I've never been here. Who did this? Couldn't get the last ones. You? The children. The children Hugh Crain built the house for. The children he never had. I only saw Theo drive up. Well, I... uh... Uh... Nell Vance... Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us. Don't get in the way, please. No -- My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her. Then who called me? But you told me to look in the paper! You told me I'd be perfect! The children want me. They're calling me. They need me. Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! Because that's where their bones are! He killed <i>hundreds</i>. He took them here and he killed them. Their bones are in the fireplace! It's not real? Crain? He's not real? And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them! I don't know. A lullaby I guess. My mother used to hum it to me. And her mother before that, and so on. Hugh Crain, would you care to dance? It doesn't matter. Even if they're tormenting me, someone wants me. What I do with this is up to me. I can be a victim, or I can be a volunteer. And I want to be the volunteer. Why? Sure. Welcome Home. It was a stupid thing to do. Let's say it wasn't you. Who did it? Are you coming to confess? I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study. I got more scared. Yes. I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face. I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom. In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood. It was very specific. That smell... oh, God. Sorry. Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on? All the carvings. Yes, because someone was always keeping me awake. Ever since I was little. That was my job. I took care of my mother and I had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time. And after she died, well, it's been a few months, but I still, I still wake up, it's... a habit. I know we've only known each other a couple of hours, but I'm really glad to be with people who let me talk about this. I'm really happy to be here with you. I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim. You can call me Nell, Dr. Marrow. Why? Yes. Why? Who? Is there something about the house? Why do you need a chain like that? I'm with Dr. Marrow's group. I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house. Is she here? Are you Mister Dudley, the caretaker? Oh! You scared me. No one will come any nearer than that. Why would we -- Well, I've never lived with beauty. You must love working here. They're so beautiful. Aren't they? Mrs. Dudley. Oh, Theo. You know I don't have an apartment. Just had to be sure. They're all in here. All the ones he killed. They're just children! We have to help them! I don't think I want any. -- but the painting! This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there -- the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting! Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed -- Because I don't want to ruin things. Because home is where the heart is. -- What do you think? I think so. I'm trying. Have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it'd ruin things. I don't know, you know... I'll take that as a compliment. In the city, what kind of place do you live in? I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo. Red. What else? I've never had a pedicure before. I don't know what to think anymore. There's hundreds of them. This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said. Why? Theo... Did you? No, it's getting worse. David? David? David Watts? Can you hear us? David! Daviiiiid! What's his first name? How could he have left without his keys? Yes. I feel realy rested, too. Theo? You know it wasn't a joke, Theo. Good night, Theo. Yes. I've missed it. A monster? But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal. I love this house. I really love this house. I know. I don't have anyone. But I do have a little apartment of my own. It has a little flower garden. You can just see the ocean. At night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor. No. Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment. Not really. I'm between jobs right now. My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over. So... And you? That's why we're here. I don't know what you mean. It's all I could afford. Fifteen dollars. This? It's from a thrift shop.Nell! Was sure she'd be in here. Nell -- Will the two of you shut up! God damn it! Maybe the tests were right, Marrow. She's sensitive, she's vulnerable, but I don't think she's suicidal and I didn't have to test her. Maybe she wasn't trying to kill herself. Maybe she was really scared. Maybe she really heard voices. Maybe someday. Yeah. That depends on your definition of ghosts. I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake. We're fucked. We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning. Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you? No. You could have. He must have left. Didn't like the looks of the place or something. Luke. And why didn't Marrow tell us ? Doesn't he trust women? That fuck. The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me. I'm alone. Nobody's talking to me but myself. My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think. But the experiment was a failure. I'm not going back to New York City. I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor. What about you? Oh God, we can't get out! He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him. She thought it was ghosts. Let's go look for him again. She needs help. Yes. But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night. How could you do this to people? It's okay... we're all here... Maybe they're Mary's. Well this is a cozy breakfast. When do we take the tests? No, but Nell's been here longer than I have. Then let's go get you one. What'd you come back for, babe? Come on! Why are we waiting? I do. I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep. And then I'm going to get some brandy. Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up. Nell, what happened? Then who is? Come on, Nell. Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second? Why wouldn't you be afraid? Really afraid. Marrow said the same thing as last night, he says -- -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley. And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney. He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current -- Okay. Are you sure? My place isn't like yours, Nell, it doesn't have a view of sea. It doesn't have a view of anything. What's interesting about the way I live is what goes on inside the walls. Living with me... My boundaries aren't very well defined, Nell. Do you know what I mean? You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me? I have a loft. Me too. Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself. You can be a pretty decent bitch. Well? Just think about one thing right now: What color? Well, it wasn't me. Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and... You said the Good Doctor was with you. Before he painted your name over Mister Crain. That's so sad. I don't know. You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention. Maybe he did it... Maybe you did it yourself. Is it over? Maybe he never came in. If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. Maybe he's outside. David. Watts? Two sets. I don't know. Maybe they're not even his. I guess. Oh, your hair! It looks good. If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him. You, too. Happy tossing and turning. No. The world has missed you. You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you? The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb. Why didn't he tell us? You're okay. Jeez. A blank canvas! I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not. So, you? Husbands? Boyfriends? Girlfriends? Where do you live? My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't. If we could all live together... but... they hate each other. It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party. D'you know what I mean? Don't tell me Boston is different from New York. That depends. What do you do? Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much. Light sleeper. Wait. You're not wearing that ironically? This is really you? That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it! What did it cost? And what you're wearing, that's great, too.Why not? We think? Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time. Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road. I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive. Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person. It must've been a time. A golden moment. I like the colors. Not who, food. Should we get Italian. Italian. Italian? Oh, god. For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience. You demand to be served. A fork fetishist. Like you. Why? What kind of food? It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating? It's not a knock. No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe. Well, you're certainly not a person. I'm loyal to things that make me happy. Is that a problem? Then what good is he? I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house. I used to hate it. Now I like it.I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A. Hard to miss. No, but I know what he means. You just cooking then? Well, those are the breaks. Really. Probably. Uh-huh. Not much -- you? You're just on a higher plane, Wilson. Poor baby. Friends and colleagues . How do you know? What's in Big Sur? I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation. I don't know -- few hours, I guess. Up the coast. She never would have turned you in, not in a million years. Still, you could never ... do what she wanted. She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her. A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick. Minor officials bother you, don't they? Won't he be looking for you about now? I guess you're just habitual. What'd your father do? He alive to see this? What about your grandmother? Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. Yeah, well, you're here now -- -- where h urricanes h ardly ever h appen. Only in the movies. -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck. One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't. Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us. Pushing the legal limit even then. I don't believe it. You have been away. Or is all this just new to you? Overnight. What about just now? Who remembers. I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo. From pursuing your chosen profession. It didn't discourage you, though. You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess. What did you do? To make them take the early 70's away from you. Still, there have been rewards. It's sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits. It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild. You don't know how I've compromised my standards. These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide? This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me. You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes. She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid. But she never turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me. Or coming straight to see me. Who knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive. Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had been -- having some trouble. Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point. There's the phone. You want his number. On what. What makes you so certain. Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type. You don't believe it was a car accident. You fuckin' guys and your dicks. Are you serious. So what's the deal. You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what this is about. -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? Right. I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life. I bet. I see. What line is he in. Who's Mr. Lindgren? -- Your employer? Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure. Do you even know who Terry Valentine is? That's what was estimated. Where you get your bank statements. What's that, like a P.O. box. The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it? Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean? I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why. I should really give him a call. He's a character, isn't he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world. And you've seen Eddie Rama. I might've been away for the weekend. You haven't been lurking outside my building all day. When did you get in? She was happy here. However the two of you might have parted. Don't think she wasn't. She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you. You weren't disappointed in her, then. Modelling. When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look. She never told anyone else. About the convict strain -- or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. Disappointed. Not ashamed. Not embarrassed. I'm sorry. I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. It must've been the bars. Now who's being sarcastic? Three seasons. They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three -- the ingenue. If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie? Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go. Sounds like Beverly Hills. Try calling me again. Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you. And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time? In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel. I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure." That's not what I heard. It's been a while. Been busy, have you. No, why did you come here? Why did you come here? Not her brand. You look alike.I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow... You wouldn�t understand. I don�t know. Everyone�s dead... On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do? My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged... The staff don�t know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldn�t take any more... They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned. No. Not us... Do you think we�d let him get away with the murder of my brother? He... He is dead! MY HUSBAND IS DEAD! Call my parents. They�ll tell you. Call them! What are you doing? You can�t. I... Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That�s when he hit me, and told me he�d killed my brother... �You don�t know what you�ve done,� he said. �We�re in deep trouble,� he said. �We,� he said. �We.� We�d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting... I didn�t intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that you�d been back. That we�d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn�t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see... My husband didn�t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered... You seem to know what you�re talking about. Should I? Simplify and damn. Here we go again. Something like that. Something like that. I didn�t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard! Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright. ...We�re turning in circles. You splendid bastard... You bastard... Why do I feel I needn�t answer that? Good. Think what you like. But don�t presume to understand. I didn�t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? I�ve known for five years. He�s known I�ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn�t speak about... That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No. You�re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he�d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don�t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest... I didn�t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles. Leon could still have hung himself. If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don�t you accuse me of killing my brother? ...You-you spoke to him? Leon hung himself... Leon hung himself... Leon hung himself. My brother hung himself. No! How... When did you... Huh! Don�t you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it. Whatever the reason, I�m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out. You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you�d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you�re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right? Have you finished? Why... I don�t know what you�re talking about. You�re mad... You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I... Sorry? I... If you don�t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There�s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you? I... Well, we�re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it�s late and with the funeral... I�m really sorry you were not called... When did you get back? Mr Lombard... Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes... Paul Lamont...? Yes... You woke me up... It�s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman? ...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet? Just a moment... Go ahead. Mr Lombard? You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard. W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard? Huh! Really? Hotels? Are we understood? I�m impressed. That information could have cost me �20,000. Who is Friedman? You lost my money? Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting. I still don�t buy your story but I figured it can�t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about. Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard? The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard. Laurence! No. You�re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you... Get out of my house. You�re fired, Mr Lombard. No. The question now is how long it�s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard. How dare you... You don�t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard? Oh no. You�ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard. Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he? Excuse me? What... What are you talking about? You... You found that at Leon�s? Disney! How inter... Anything is possible. Can it be that easy? Oh-oh! Touch�, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Don�t. You might get confused speaking of things you don�t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you�ve done what we are paying you for. For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that. I won�t comment on the time but you�ll understand if I don�t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. Perhaps it wasn�t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know. I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard. Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn�t want anyone to interfere with his �Art�! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought. Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn�t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over �1,000 to get rid of him. That depends what you�re looking at. Now you know why you�re here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.Huh! And they say charity�s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ... You cannot walk away from this. You cannot. My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I�m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But he�s a good guy. He�ll listen to you. He won�t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay? ...I�m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that�s who I am. Do you get what I�m fucking saying, Mr Lombard? Damn it! You can�t fucking walk away from this! Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god�s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it? A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I�ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it�ll be too late. That-that won�t do. That�s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that�s the way... We�re both thinking the same thing, right? Italian? The Mafia...? So who... Who�s the man? Where is he? What...? Look, you don�t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn�t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who�s the guy? The Austrian? Have you found your man? Is that where he is? Oh. What... Yeah. Okay. What am I to do with the packages if... Don�t fall asleep with your hair wet. Right... Well, I�ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then. A little too tight, eh? ...They were my son�s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... There�s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you�re hungry. Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn�t I hear you right? Did you not enter this country illegally? It�s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn�t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you? How come you�re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise? Like you�ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round? No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy�s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard? A recent acquisition. We�ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat�s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back. There�ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it�s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee? I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won�t be for a couple of hours. You know where to look for your Austrian, right? There are over 4 million people in this city - why me? Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr... You don�t know why he�s come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his? By your Austrian? Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can�t you go back there? Okay. The woman just can�t walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can�t you go to your Embassy? You... Jesus Christ! I can�t believe this... What�s coming now, eh? If I don�t pay all Hell�s gonna break loose, is that it? Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right? I�m fine standing, thank you. I don�t smoke. If you could get to the point... You�re a long way from home... May I ask where you�re from, Mr Lamont? Shit! Fuck! What�s fucking wrong with people! I�m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! No. You�re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say? Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh! That�s right. Where�s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero? If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed... Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney�s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...Yes. How did... Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of... What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you? Your secretary, huh! Piss off! Well, I�m sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I�ve got the week off and he�s come to stay. No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe it�s there with... Hello there. How�s the flat. I cleaned... I came to feed your fish. I didn�t know... She�s pretty... See you, huh? Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that�s what they do to their employees, isn�t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people�s lives. Thanks for the lift! Oh no. I�m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true? Oh... We split up. So you haven�t seen the film, then? I don�t know. How many famous French film directors can there be? �La collectionoose�. It�s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It�s on TV tonight and as I�m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it�s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director�s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him? Have you heard of a French film called �La Collectionoose�? Yes. But my boss reckons you�d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It�d cost you about �100 but he said it�d be worth it. Of course, you�d need a partner to register. But that�s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right? Must be your lucky day then. I�ve got your accounts - you don�t owe much tax for last year. Fine. How was the match? Did you loose? Hello again, neighbour. I didn�t intrude, did I?Jah... �10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy? My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return. Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate. We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention. The �1,000 is on account. When... I�m told he came here... The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonard�s address, keys and other things you might need. No. And before you ask, no, he�s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious... He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it. Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it. Yesterday. It all looked normal. Then you should not have sought an explanation. I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account. Do what, Mr Lombard? You wouldn�t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now. Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that... What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard! Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard? You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant. Must I speak to you in French? Whatever, you come recommended. We... What if it is? Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it? May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard? Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My husband... My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My son-in-law, Carlos... The gentleman is a business partner of his.Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you. Give it to me! If I don't answer, he'll know something's up. I have to answer him. They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down. That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to-- You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you. Thanks for taking care of this for me. Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you? Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with. In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead. Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you. Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose. I'm the one's got the big stick. Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge. No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps. What if I do? In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around. You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders. Get out of my way. Then step aside. It's a combat action. I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done. He tried to kill us. If not just now, then in the helicopter. That's all the authority I need. We're at war. He's an enemy soldier. You don't know he isn't. That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something. We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position... I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance. He...he could have been watching us. Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold. Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first. I told you; don't push me around. I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us. He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him. You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around. You got no reason to do that! Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own. Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out. You're the one with all the ideas. What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share. Maybe we should split it up now. What about the gold? You ready? Ready when you are. Epps! What am I supposed to do? Missile! And they can't fly around out there forever. Weird they didn't chase us. Where'd they go? Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere. What do you figure it to be? The US Army: Always an adventure. Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now. And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it. We can't just go off and-- We can fight. That's what we're here for: To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds. The soldiers are going to kill those people! Yeah. Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing. What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us. For climbing. Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff. What kind of mine? He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks. Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot. Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either. What are you doing. Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged. We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on! Oh, Jesus, they've stopped. They stopped. What are we going to do!? No, please, not again. I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine. What? Oh, God. You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking? Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time. It's a map, I think that's what it is. What's it say? Paper. Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box. I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school. ...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive. Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war? You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch. When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something. And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis. See how I mean? Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers. The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them. You want to say some words? He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out. I'm not wasting my water on him. All last night he could have been-- Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter. He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands. What the hell are you doing!? What do you see? You down? It's got a bottom. What do you think? Just seems weird they didn't chase us. We make it, or we go back empty handed. You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad. We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people. We have to do something. Is there anything you do know? Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some. I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger. If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself. You want to crawl, crawl. Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more. How long we going to keep this up. Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway. Really? What is that, an order, private ? You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent. Then lets go back while we still can. So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere? We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on? We have to go back. We got to get out of here. I thought we were dead. I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss. Oh, Jesus! Oh, God! This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it. If there's gold. If! How the hell should I know how much? I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold. If! If there's a treasure. Oh, no. We're going to get court martialed, you know that. God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't. You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive. Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter. So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps. It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real. You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know-- You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it. What? Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers? It's a container. Break the seal. The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage. This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it. You ever think about it? You ever worry? You ever think about dying? Jaeger? Why would they do all that if we weren't? We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war. They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting-- That's in two days. You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait. Jaeger? You really think there's a treasure inside? You will. You'll get it. You get it yet? And you're the guy who's going to open it. It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside. He says it's a box. Now you need me. Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble. Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender. I thought it would be good to know. I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia. Come on. You're going to get us in trouble. I'm saying don't do it accidently. People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything. I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally. Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes. Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable. Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.They don't even realize they should be frightened. Here. Mr. Tyler. He claims a certain skill at handling firearms. We'll see. Fine, I'll stop. I try. Please, if you promise to protect me, I'll testify against him. I'll give you an ironclad case. My. It's gotten longer. She's perfectly safe. You've... done... this... before. Would that include me? Thank you. But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it? I'm not so sure Dr. Loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger. Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler? You must excuse the Doctor. No one has ever beaten him at his little game. You most certainly do. Oh, don't worry. I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list. Yes, in a way. I'm the Doctor's social secretary. I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know. Well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests. My... the wild west. Really? I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before. I get that feeling. You know, Mr. Tyler, I'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. But after spying you across the room, I'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.So isn�t it time you unwrapped your present? We can�t. But what if... What kind of bikes did you ride? Do you know what you�re doing? He�s going to insert the plutonium. Is there another way? Zukovsky... The King pipeline. But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe... Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. He�s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub�s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown. What is it? What would she want with weapons grade plutonium? Elektra King? Are you insane? This is her pipeline. Who�s she? What the hell are you talking about? What the hell were you doing? You nearly killed us! It�s a bomb alright. We�re still dead if the trigger charge goes off... The plutonium is missing. They�ve taken the core! When this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens. They won�t get far. Every warhead has a locator card. A Miratom device. Emits a high-pitched signal on Russian emergency frequencies. We can track the bomb. So who are you? He is an impostor. There�s no Davidov at Miratom. The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we weren�t around, they�d have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun. What happened to Len Tashka? Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I�ve heard them all. You new? What class sub does your nephew run? What is this place? Bond! What?Oh James. Know what happens when a man is strangled? It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I�m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather�s name, the glory of my people. It is my oil! Mine and my family�s! He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom. Just like you...only you were even easier. Since I was a child, I�ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn�t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance. Five more turns and your neck will break. Soon she�ll be everywhere. I could have given you the world. You do what you have to do, but I�ve called in M. She�s en route from London even now. You knew. You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike? How dare you! How dare you! That animal!? That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me! So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn�t have to sleep with you to find that out. I don�t know what you�re talking about! Are you saying...Renard is the man who�s trying to kill me? ...what? What are you talking about? What�s wrong with you? Are you crazy? I used my body on the guards. It gave me control. I got to a gun and I took my chance. I�ve never told anyone that. You knew when you first saw me. You knew it would be like this. Surely you believe in living dangerously. Really? You had your chance, James. Now I�m looking for a bigger thrill. Someone wants to kill me, I�d rather die looking him straight in the eye. What are you doing here? Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one? Vodka martini. I don�t want to be safe! Then take me with you. James... What is it? The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I�m a coward. I know. No! It will cave in! I can�t stay here. Oh my God...we�re buried alive... You don�t take no for an answer, do you? I have to check the upper lines. Gabor will drive you back. You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it. That�s every man within a five mile radius. Including you. That�s why you�re here, isn�t it? You think I can�t do it. You think I�m going to screw up. Or get myself killed. If you�ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you. I have two bodyguards, I don�t need a third... Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women? It�s my father�s pin. He wore it everyday of his life. Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask? My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He�s decisive, vigilant. And he makes an excellent omelette. Partially, yes. God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don�t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. I loved him. I�m not sure he knew that. I haven�t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now. I met you at my father�s funeral. Who? Bond? Bond is dead. Now you know how it feels. To be locked away, to wonder if they�re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you. Is nothing. His kingdom he stole from my mother. The kingdom I will rightly take back. Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didn�t think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market. Please. Could...could you come? Everything�s under control up here. Are you ready? No. It is the beginning. The world will never be the same. What do you think? Of course... How would you know? Warm.He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. I intend to finish it for him. He was my father. A word? I�m sure by now he�s engineered a hostile takeover. Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine. Beautiful, isn�t it?
