Is this really happening? Because you're afraid! I should kill you... if it's true you should die... I should kill you now! YOU'RE A LIAR! You're a liar. How... how can... how can you be here and say this? You killed them. Then what? Yes... What? No, I do. It's nothing. It's just a picture. Okay. I speak English.Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now. You do? It wouldn't have changed the way you feel. But you found another choice. I love you, too. Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this. There must be another way! What if it's not who you think it is? Where are you going? -- hang on -- -- it's just him? -- Jesus! -- -- is he back there? -- -- where? - What? -- where's left to go? -- I don't want to move again... I like it here. ...but you're not -- you're not sure... Where -- That's crazy. So... But you're sure? But we were so careful. No... How? One day it will be different. It just takes time. We'll make new memories. You and me. You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over. Sleep. Sleep now. I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it. I worry when you get like this. We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good. -- it hasn't been two years -- You're sure? We should still -- we should write it down. I'll get the book. Where were you, Jason? In the car....it's not in the file... I swear... I know your file... your first job was Geneva!... I swear to God you never worked here!... No... Jason... please... You never worked Berlin... Your first assignment was Geneva. No. You never worked Berlin. What do you mean? He closed down Treadstone -- he took care of me after Paris... Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott -- Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you! And you got to him before we could. It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was. Last week an Agency field officer went to make a buy from a Russian national. What is this, a game? They know! They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know! You hear me? I believed you. I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you... Yes. So? I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him. It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know. Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us. I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway. What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out. These were killers. Conklin had them all jacked up. They were Dobermans. You mean, did I want a date? You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice. If you say so. I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown. Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him. Am I a doctor, no, but... Good luck. Before this? Before Bourne? No. Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --No. You lost your way. No good options left? And Danny Zorn, what was that? And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it. 'Why' would be enough for me. I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you. I'm sorry, Ward. Don't know. Did he say anything to you? They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time. Sorry to wake you. Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission. I want the Berlin police fully briefed and -- -- get this out to all the agencies. So what's he doing? You believe him? Don't you want answers? Hold on -- he said he wants to come in. And you do? From the moment he left Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find him... I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family. What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin! May I finish? Excuse me. ...At the time of his death, Conklin was sitting on a personal account in the amount of seven-hundred and sixty thousand dollars. ...this is Conklin's computer. ...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This... I think I do. We had a deal going down in Berlin last week. During the buy, both our Field Agent and the seller were killed. We pulled a fingerprint from a timing charge that didn't go off. They were killed by Jason Bourne. And Bourne? Where's he now? So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we're cutting the crap... I want to know what happened. Let's talk about Conklin. He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward. I want to know about Treadstone. That's not gonna fly. Treadstone. Why you're alive? You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive. Because we want you back on our side. Sounds like a threat. Do you think you can read? Are you well enough? Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie. Are you disappointed? Careful... Ramstein Air Base, Germany. Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital. Okay, Jason, your move. Who? Okay, how do you want to do it? What do you want? Bourne? What? The tapes? We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes. This stays between you and I. We finally have an edge. I don't want to lose it. Alright... take it down. I want to look at the room. Check it out. -- the hotel -- how far? -- -- uplink all relevant files to Kim -- -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone -- Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with. Who's going? Us? And the Germans can't match it? We need to get in there. I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again. How's that scan? For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price. We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop. That's where we came out. Felt promising. It's a start. Let's give him half an hour. Alright... What do you think? Is he coming in? Is it fresh? And why is that? See, that's a problem for me, Nicky. Whatever he's doing, we need to end it. This isn't the kind of mess you walk away from. Some women like Dobermans -- Did you? You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death? Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story. Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through? So he fooled you. Believed what? Are you an expert in amnesia? I'm curious about Bourne. Your interpretation of his condition. You have specific training in the identification and diagnosis of psychological conditions? You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us. Amnesia? What kind of problems? And what about you, anything? Are we hacking or asking? Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there... By who? Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here? Are we locked up? Anything? What the hell is a "Treadstone?" Do we know what this says?What? Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture? What is it? I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work -- No dances, just tell me. So what did you find. Evan wake up, oh please wake up! How soon?... Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off. Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple. But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have? But you must have something to go on? And the bad news? Why? What for? Anything. Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness... Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition? Just. Like. Jason. How. Did you. Know that? You're. Acting. Like your father. Fix? What does that mean for Evan? Cute, Evan. Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now. I found these. The others are still in storage. I don't know. These things take time. ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient. And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could... I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them... When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past. Why do you ask? Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him. I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes. Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one! Something must've happened! What set him off? Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay? Honey. What were you doing with that? Great. I'll see you soon. That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss. You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him. Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there. I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I? We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him. You know the answer to that. Darn it! Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time. When did you ever care about getting to school on time?Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends. Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine. It's crossed my mind from time to time. When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again. That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother. Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about. Is something the matter? You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie. We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages. Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family. Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act. Sure you don't want your wallet? There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority. There's one major hole in your story. Know what? Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that. Oh? There's proof now? I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit? You're right, Evan, I don't believe you. On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch. Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years. Because you're... different. I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case. What's happened to you? Ha! Where's that? Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious? So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor. Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone. Evan. Stop it. It's not the time. Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him! Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket? I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but... I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same. It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know? Are you okay? My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy. It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids. Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me. It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago. Why are you doing all this for me? I don't know what to say. It's beautiful. I don't understand, where are you taking me? As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me? Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird. Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks? Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out? Those are your clothes, silly. Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed. Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better! Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath. Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood? It was a long time ago. What do you want to know, Evan? Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot. Of course. Me? Are you kidding? Why? She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever. Not if you remember my dad. No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen. They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody. I've stopped a hundred times. No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in. God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been? Hi, Lenny. Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay? He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore. I deserve a lot worse. It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny. Ouch. You really don't remember anything that happened? Oh God... what did we do? We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead. Shut up, Tommy! Oh my God oh my God... I'm sorry. Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already. You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff. Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham! Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it. Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it... Yesterday I had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. Most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this... I was going to show this to the principal, but I wanted to talk to you first. Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name? You did? You liked me? But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car... Okay, I guess. Hi. Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski. What's wrong with me? It's gorgeous. Just my taste. I've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive. I'm so excited. Yay! Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit. Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight! Come up to Boston with me? Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense. I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me. In the room? You rat. Come over after I'm done here? You were not. Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know? What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay. Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess. Okay, I guess. I just wanted to say that. Come by my house. Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill. You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock." We should have sex. It's old hat for us. Says you were constantly calling me a slob. It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think? Doesn't sound like me. Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it. Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man. Says you were jealous and suspicious. A bully? Moi? Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling. Well, you obviously don't know me. I'm nervous, too. Hey, Joel -- That's okay. I -- Oh, um... Make love? Joel, come here. Please. What if? Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year. Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines. When? So you'll call me, right? Bye, Joel. Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one. What if you stay this time? So go. No, it's our house! Just tonight -- -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment. Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet. Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name? I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass. I could see you wanted to come in, Joel. C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off. It's freezing out here. Cool. At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree. Male or female? Oh. Let's move into this neighborhood. I wish we did. You married? Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live. Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live... Yeah, maybe. I think, before. Me too. There's this poem -- Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store. Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova? I'll give you a couple. See what you think. You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance. But my sleeping is really fucked up. No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated. What do we do? This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon. Yeah, like that. Oh God, how horrid. I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken? Yeah, I know. I'm fishing. I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod. I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either. Hi there. Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can. I know. Probably. I had you pegged, didn't I? Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours. So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again. Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me. Well, you're married. Yeah? I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all. Is that what you want? Yes, exactly. Exactly my point. Come up and see me... now. So what. Infatuation is good, too. But you weren't. I could tell. I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure. I'll buy that. Black's always good. Egad, were you horrified? What was I wearing? Naomi, I guess. This is our first "date" date. Yeah. I love it! Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy! Joel! Look at you, cutey! What are we doing? Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried? Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally. But can't you see... I love you, Antoine. Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now. Really? Is he cute? What? -- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do? You remember what happened next? You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over. Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden. I'm right here. Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? And we can hide there till morning. What if you hide me? Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake? Oh? Such a beautiful view. It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real. I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand." Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit? Joely... More? Joel, you're a liar. I want to know you. You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me. You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so -- Would you get me another, Joely? It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with! I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother! You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it! Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it! What?! You're not ready. No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby. I want to have a baby. I'm fucking crawling out of my skin. How can you watch this crap? Fuck you, Joel. Faggot. A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight? Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something. ...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic. Yo ho ho! You didn't say anything about my hair. Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all. When? You'll call me, right? I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that. Okay. You should stay. I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and -- Yeah? Oh, great! I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime. Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know? That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year. Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph. I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. So, I've been seeing this guy... I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat? You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh? Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist? What's the goal, Joel? My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know? And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal? I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy. You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot. Oh. Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have. It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you? But I think I am. I like to think I am. Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right? Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know? Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. I know a man who needs a refill. No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill? I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good. You pick it. Ready for another? Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway. God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off. I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers! Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know? Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back. The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation? This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow. You like that? Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel. Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could -- Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that. Anyway. See Ya. Thanks very much. That was very nice of you. I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. Me. Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..." Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry. The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember? Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way. So you like bookstores, huh? Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really. Wilmont. Near the high school. You know Wilmont? You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that. You're not a stalker or anything, right? Yeah? I don't want to take you out of your way. No, that's okay. Thanks, though. Unless I get that hair-color-naming job. Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then. My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you. I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today. Joel? It's Joel, right? Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on. I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me. Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish. Why wouldn't you think that about me? Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told. Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No? Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts? Huckleberry Hound? No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice. My name's Clementine, by the way. Yeah, I got it. Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you? I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You? My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs. Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it. Purple Haze, Pink Eraser. Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole. Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song? Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering. Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh? I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me. Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead. Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now. Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now. Get out! Me too! What are the odds? Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course. No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to -- Oh. So... It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. Really? Why are you sorry? I just said hi. Why?Here we are. How are you today? Ms. Kruczynski? Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you. May I help you? I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things. "The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts." I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy? Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you? Oh, hey, Patrick. Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo! I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book. They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth. I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that? Then why did you ask me? Nothing. What do you want, Stan? Oh. Thanks, Stan. Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything. And after that? How did I look? And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together? Do you swear you didn't know? Hell no. He's coming? This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan. Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done. Well, what should we do? Where? What? To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away. It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world. Let him go, Stan. I can help. Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important? Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate. Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts. Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something. Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink? It's freezing out. I better do this, Stan. 'kay. Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here. It's just... y'know... I mean... Stan... c'mon... Hi. You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you -- You made me have an abortion. Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you! Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what? What, Howard? No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard. I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids. I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that. Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible? Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all. I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to -- You are such a sweetheart. Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out. There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander. Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know. Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders." Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too. Do you like quotes, Howard? That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. Welcome, Howard. Cole slaw, ice tea? Yes? Howard, your one o'clock.'Night. So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay. Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right. I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny. I'm glad you called. A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy. Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while. Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and -- I'm sorry. So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time? Yeah. Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun! I've got to finish this chapter anyway. Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold. Hi, Rob and Carrie. How was it? Hi. The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems. Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone. Don't say "we" when you mean "you." What? So what's going on, Joel? Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really. Yours?This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- -- It's the truth. And only I know it. Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know. Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --Creasy... Wait. You're lying. I don't believe you. I don't believe you. Planned what? Why are you here? Why didn't you die? Jordan! The traffic takes some getting used to. Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends. It makes it all seem so serious. No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that. You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends. Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy? How are you getting along with Pinta? It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment? Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat. Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need. You've done much of this work before? You're American. The world of our children. How dare they? I'll call you from Detroit, baby. Don't forget your towel. Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby. You do? This is Mr. Creasy. We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked. Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back. Good news. You're going back to school. You should be sleeping, baby. She's young. She'll get over it. He has to go. It's not. Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father. Creasy. He has to go, Samuel. Creasy. Pinta likes him. She likes him. You realize that you've brought a killer into the house. I think it's nice he's American. Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy? Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy. Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed. Our child's safety is at stake. I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter. A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.You got that right. Dyslexic? I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number. I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you. There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained. You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim. Frank. Frankie. You think too much? My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy? I know because I go in your room and check the bottles. You don't drink like you used to. Could I ask you a question? I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free. Why today? And why'd she have to go with him? What's so important in Los Angeles? I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you. The gunshot holds no fear. Are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid you, Creasy. It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you? Where's my mother? You were never late before, I was worried. You're late. Did you used to? Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me. Yes. I don't understand. What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes? So how come you know so much about those countries? [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?] It must be difficult having lots of wives. But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be? It was in a book at school. Concubine. Doesn't matter. I always finish second. It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle. Yes. I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends. The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you? My ankle. Everywhere! It hurts. They can stay for two weeks. I don't care. It's better to be free, right? How do you think he got out? Maybe. Did you hear him? Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him. Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late. I go to school, don't I? I'm not crying. Oh... So you were unhappy? Hmmm? But why not? Not at all? Did you like school, Creasy? We're taking a different way home. There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico? Someone gave him more money than we could. Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit. Potential? I don't understand. Why not? You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you? I know. But which state? Where are you from, Creasy? Creasy... In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy? My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon. That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left. Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside. Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German? Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy? You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead. Bye, Mom. I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick. He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'... I like him, Mom. Yes, mom? Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English. When? I'm trying, mom.[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."] [Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?] [No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.] [She's late, Mr. Creasy.]Well, in that case... No, we're paying for the wine. You are not. That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys. Anything I'd know? Oh yeah? What kind of stuff? Are you a writer too? Highliner, please. Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles. Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message. You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine. Yeah. But you wanted to fuck me first. Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to. Do you know what he's been saying to her? Don't touch me. Just take me home. Were you ever going to say anything? What rehearsal dinner? Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend? About two-thirty. You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today. You too. I had class. Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me. Goodnight, Miles. Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course. Okay. See you around. I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did. You know how to get back to the Windmill, right? Yeah. Like what a fraud he was. I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about. What about me? Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you. Can I ask you a personal question? Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think? Well... I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week. Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it. Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes. Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even. So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...? Oh. You mean... today? What's the title? So what's your novel about? Yeah, weird. But great. It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost. Yeah, same here. You got kids? She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie. Yeah, Siena's a sweetie. I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit. Eighty-eight Sassicaia. I started to get serious about seven years ago. The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion. It might be too late already. What are you waiting for? Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read. You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up... So what gems do you have in your collection? Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want? Hey. Are you all right? I'm having the salmon. I know. I love that. I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time. Twelve months in oak. Try it. A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc. Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack. Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying? Good for you. So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked. Sure. Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today? I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight? Hey, Miles. Good to see you.See you over there, Miles. I'm pregnant. Not me. I'm not drinking. I guess. I am. Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do? So what's happening with your book? So how're you doing? Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate. Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband. Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding. I'm going to hang up now, Miles. Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not. Ken. Miles, don't call me when you're drunk. Where are you? Oh, Miles. You're drunk. Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind? Miles? Hello?Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them. Please. Deputy Director, get out, sir. Serial killer killed. In Ft. Myers. Cut up in his van. And this time we got a witness. We have another one. Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know. Maybe cause he's smart. Just an observer. What happened? How are we going to find him? It's a truck. A refrigerated truck. I... You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going. Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so. All the same killer? It's quite advanced. What's going on? You okay? Tom, you okay? Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer. I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer. Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now. You're putting me in a difficult position. It's okay to be wrong, just don't be dead wrong. I'd be real careful if I were you. Koessler doesn't know any of this? Does one exist? And you're working with him? Slow down a second, you met with Low -- What's going on? This feels like something out of a spy novel. But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low. Suspect Zero. You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you. I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one. Where are you? Everybody's looking for you. Hello? I just need to go a little slow. That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around. And nobody else can do that? You need time to think. About the case, about you and me. Then there's the other issue. There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is. No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me. Maybe we should back off a bit. I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you. Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that. You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable. Not yet. This time they're waiting for you. You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso. They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs. Sue Ann Hanson. We're trying to match them with dump site bodies. This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one -- We did find these, however. No. Cut off while he was still alive, look at his wrists, damn near ripped his hands off trying to get free. Must have been screaming real loud when the killer chain-sawed his throat. Unfortunately, he'd soundproofed his van. Not yet. Not about this, either. Just routine stuff. He's called a couple times. I've been thinking about this. It's a no-no. There are Agency regulations about this. Because you asked him to, stupid. No, Mack, I do not think you're a square and definitely not a nerd. Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me? Huh? Don't be too harsh. He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode. I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better. Me too. Make any headway with "Zorro"? My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae. What's this country coming to? Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good? Sex. And one other thing. I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me. You got a point there. This is some serious shit. "Gone live?" They're all criminals? You want to have dinner? That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff. What about the chat rooms themselves? Don't even go there. What's up? Relax. J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge. It explains a lot. Some kids found you in a garbage dump. A very sexy case. And who kills in the manner of his victim. Doesn't fit. This is a sexy case. Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics. What did you do to piss him off? Not especially. Five months. I love it. I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime. You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right? None taken. Thanks for the ride. I'll be back. Turn around. Stretch your arms over the seat. Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon. I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you. Mack must think Zero has a police band. Sit back. Kulok.Robin. What does that mean? I'm not pretty. I have friends. It's my bird book. See anything interesting? My daddy likes me home before dark. I have to go. Were you watching me? Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too? You should hear the bird. Something like that. It's a bright sound. I can't. It's hard to describe. Their sound is quite musical. You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare. When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here. They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy. I don't like starlings. They're starlings. There's little chicks! You want to see? There's a million birds here. What are you looking at?Will I see you again? Can't I stay a little longer? I don't mind. Do you still want me to sit on your lap? Walter? I don't want to hurt my daddy. How do you know? But will he... ? What will happen if I do? I can't. Ms. Kramer. Yes. My daddy lets me sit on his lap. They sound like finches. Do you want me to sit on your lap? I'm sure. Thank you all the same. No thank you. What? Yes? Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them. It sounds like you were banished. How come? Do you have many friends? I will be in three months. I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world. I'm twelve. Yeah, like the bird.If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her. Have you seen Walter? Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you? Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice. Why's that? What? Not when they fly. Fucking liar. You okay? Do you want to talk about it? What's going on? What's your fucking problem? Do what? Prove it. Don't be scared, Walter. You're such an asshole. Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine. What's it look like? Fine. Guess that makes you pretty special. Who doesn't? Just think about it. I think it's a fucking good idea. Move in with me. We should live together. Neither am I. You're scared. What? Not ever. Are you serious? I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you. I love my brothers. All three -- in chronological order. I got poked around... here and there. Well, most people are stupid. You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds? What odds? I know. What? Bullshit. And what do you tell yourself now? You really believe that? They seduce you? Is it their innocence? Their beauty?... Why young girls, Walter? My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave. My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories. I'm sorry, Walter. You mean the time you're locked away? Yes! I want to know. What was prison like? You don't molest little girls anymore, do you? Walter. Hey, I'm not -- What? I told you I'm not easily shocked. Twelve years in prison? How young? What did you do to them? How many girls did you molest? You're not joking. Molested little girls? So, what did you do? The worst? Because I like you. Hey, there. I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else? Is that all? Did I say something wrong? Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck. I thought I'd stay the night. How about in the morning. Tell me about it. Since you've had sex? Do you? What's the problem? No you're not. I didn't say I didn't enjoy it. Hey, that was... intense. Not tonight. Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex? So? Don't you think I should know before we have sex? So... what's your dark secret? I'm not easily shocked. Something happened to you. You're damaged. I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else. Yeah, they could. What about them? I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two. My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking. Doesn't it get noisy? Is that a school? You plan to drink both those beers? You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything. Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good. Southern light. What do you think? You never spoke to me before. They're all assholes. You don't hang out with the other guys. You're quiet at work. Guess I'm not like most women. What's weird about that? Very weird. Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore? Yeah, you. I'm talking about you. There's something wrong with this picture. It's fucking freezing out here. Want a ride? Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic. What?What about "climbing in?" Even the skylight? You might be right, but Fun is overrated. I need something real. I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set.. Pass! Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet. At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog.. Winning. You can't get away with.. I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three? You people were once heroes. You had ideals. You fought for things. Spooky told me so... How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you? Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table? Tell me! Please tell me who you are; you own me that! You've seen me... I still have one left... Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect? "A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean? It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny.. You do know you're evil, don't you? You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me.. Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina. "Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move! Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but.. Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc? Oh man, come on, what do I look like? I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't... For when the..Uh, yeah, thanks, a little gold piece of...gold. Uh... I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you... You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you.. Whatever you say...Sis. Hello, Spooky. Spooky.Ask me another one-- How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess! I'm a good mother! Did you just say "girls?" You Housewives have no idea what we go through!Trust me, you won't have to. Do you always listen to what your mother says? Selina. Something you choose your life. Sometimes your life chooses you. Save the day.. Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people... I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes... Yes, I'm pretty amazing. You should see this...It came this evening. What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?" Where were you last night? I didn't hear you come in. Because she asked me--and I couldn't very well turn her down. Don't you remember-- of course you don't remember--that "Hag" is the one who brought you to that hospital in Gotham City. For what it's worth-- currently not much--we owe her your life...When I think about a single woman in Gotham City--amnesia is probably the best thing that could happen to a girl like you...Oh, don't forget your visor. Don't sneak up on me... Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late. It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm? Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm? Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you. You're late.I thought you said you weren't a very good liar. In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain... It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy... Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all? A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together. Thank you, Jeff. No-o. You know, questions like that don't help your cause-- Hmm. Not bad. Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God. Uh Brock, today you are without me... At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon. I got home fine. How's the "warehouse." I'm sure. Your warehouse? Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay... Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry. A whip? Now that's going too far! Some of these women have no shame! No it's not. I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten. When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero? Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side. Ooh, she has a dark side." Please. Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me? You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something. You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation. I checked out your stuff at the library. Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again? Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing... You designed Gotham Plaza? The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things... I'm not afraid. Are you? But of course you are. Dinner at Eight. Wouldn't miss it. How heroic of you... You're probably right. Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out.. I wonder.. I don't know. I can't remember. Guilty. I am. I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me. In women? What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel? Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference. Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning. There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it. Can I be frank, Frank? Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it. Stop. "Pre-bicentennial babe?" What's the good news? I'll let you know. Have you seen the Oasisburg Police? They drive golf carts with little red sirens. You know, now that I hear myself tell it, I'm thinking maybe both of you are messing with me. What, you get the Helmet Monday through Thursday, then Brock takes it for the weekend... Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman. Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse." Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason. I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses-- "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.." I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman. You are... I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try. Go together? Sure, why not? Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..." Hey, I thought... I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded... Like you don't know... Nothing. How's your hand? Did you try to kill... Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you? You turned around! Hey, Captain God! Next time, call... Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess... Ah! You scared me! How did you know to come here! Have you been spying.. I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan... But of course you are. Enough. I actually got some memory back last night. Yeah, she's okay. I don't know what came over me. Uh. "Thanks?" "I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers... What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again? But I'm blind. I don't know if I can do it alone. But I'm not a hero. I'm nobody's heroine..I'm nothing. You've said so yourself many times. Mom, not now! I, I don't know what to do.. They're going to attack Frank's Fun Palace! I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same. Mom? Oh Mom, I messed up... It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya. Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you... I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag... Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take.. Maybe. Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me. A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning... Yes, Mother. Dear. Nice breasts. You going to talk all day? The kicks..the rush..you mean, like pulling heists..faking your own deaths..killing innocent bystanders...like Mexican angels. I know you're a woman. Do you? You seem sad, Spooky. What's it like being a superhero? It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together? Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be.. What's a powerful man like you standing all alone for? Dance with me?I won't let him. He belongs to me now. Bye, sweetie. I'm sure he'll be heartbroken. Taking messages. Don't you have children? Do I hear a woman's voice? I'll see that he stays calm. Pack the money up and put it in the trunk. Put those away. We can't have marks on his wrists. I prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location. Once Nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies. With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate. What else did you expect him to say? Do it, Theo -- or give me the gun. He's seen both of us now. We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine. Any minute. Nels? He took it like a man. Toss him in that drainage ditch. Allow me. Lose the hardware now. Nels, don't let that cop pass you. I'm doing fine. Theo wants to deal. I told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ... My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410. Maurice. Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds. I've got ... one last number for you, Theo ... -- The phones, Theo. Don't leave any of them behind. The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you. I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I? Five ... six. Pull over! Pull over someplace. You won't live to see it. Take your hand out of there. Slowly. Local lawyer for Dominican dealers. Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf. Took preparation. That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute. Both hands on your lap. He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't -- That's not good enough. Only one way to find out. Naturally. You're the man with the gun. We can't leave him to repeat anything. He might've heard everything we said in the car. The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive. Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me. We had a backup plan. But I knew you'd come through for me. As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked. That angelic little face wasn't me at all. I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously. I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was. That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you. Why are we stopping? Think you could do a picture of me? They did some great job of reforming you. Any idea where you're going? The money, Nels ... ? I can't hear. Now there's a siren. They must be in an ambulance. What about the money? Nels? Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine. They'll have units blocking us up ahead. Do you think they'll walk away? 259-7881. No, there's a police car way back there. See it, in the distance coming around the turn? The van is blocking it now. Did you hear that? He wants 75 back. I'm still okay. Stop talking like that! You wouldn't -- You could've hit me. I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you. And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face. Naturally you didn't learn your lesson. Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel. I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you. A typical fuck-up. I don't hear him moving around anymore. The one thing you don't want is to attract the police. He seems to be headed for Topanga. Do you have to point that? You won't shoot me. That's not your style. He seems to think he's entitled to it all. There's no way out for you. You have to deal with us. Shit. You couldn't be in much worse shape. Who's in back? Nobody's easier to con than a con man. Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here. I thought it was inspired. As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished. They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday. Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school. The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses. Jack Oberfeld in person. Did you kill him? It belongs to the man you took it from. Or should I saw stole it from? There isn't any such person. The rest of the money is here in the car. Why don't you come and get it? He had a gun. I have it now. Hand me the phone. They put their hands all over me. They tortured us. And you're going to let them have all that money? You're going to let them get away with this? Why didn't you just shoot them? She'll never be the same. None of us will. Rachel was terrified when I left her. I could see it in her eyes. It's locked. Rachel -- Oh my God. I'm sorry. You've thought this out better than I ever could. I'm ready now. All right. Now that you explain it I see that you're right. Why can't it be her? Yes. But I want Rachel to come with me. Yes. I can't do it. I'm not leaving my daughter behind. Not with them. Yes sir. Yes. He's in back. Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying. I never heard Jack cry before -- She's awake but she hasn't spoken. I don't know what they did to her. I don't want to think about it. They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles. Thank you. God bless you for helping us. They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be -- God, if he doesn't come back -- What did you do? They dragged me downstairs. I thought they were going to kill me. Yes? Yes? No. I hear them. They're coming upstairs. They know! Downstairs. There must be an extension. Oh my God -- Yes -- I think so. Another crossed line? No. When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me. And they began beating him. And I watched. And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I? Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to. Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him. So cold and distant. I've let him make her like that. But I guess we haven't really met -- have we? Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met. If it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants. Tufts, you know. It still hasn't grown fully in. The other one is from the islands. Braided hair -- very dark. The front door slammed. Someone went out. There's a different car starting. Don't talk. Don't talk! To hide it from the I.R.S. Oh my God. I heard her scream again. What are they doing to her? Why can't I do anything to stop them? It's not hard to do. I do it all the time. Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago. I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds. Don't say that. Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go. Even if you found us -- what then? I heard someone pulling in behind the house. I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden. I don't know what they did to her. What do you mean? The City National on San Vincente. The one in Brentwood. When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know. It's not your fault, Theo. You tried. Don't say anything. Don't alarm them. Just go! What's happening? No. That's not her. I can hear you again, clearly. Make a right. You can't miss it. I've lost you. You're gone. I can't hear anything. You're breaking up. I can't hear you. Theo? I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself. I wasn't always like that. I don't think I was. I didn't mean to. It's just the way I am. I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you. Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours. I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron. I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist. Our house always needs touching up. What do you do for a living? I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal. And that was the end of it? I didn't mean to open up any old wounds. A woman? Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me? How much time do you have left on it? They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform. Please. Be careful. The man driving the car must have a gun. Forget about us. Just save Rachel. What are you doing now? What about the others? Will you please speak to me! Theo? Why isn't anyone answering me? She would if she heard my voice on the phone. 26th off Wilshire. "Theo?" He's right. You'll get my whole family killed. They don't know you. They won't listen. The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school. Rachel will recognize the car. She'll get right in. They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her. Rachel, my daughter. She's an honor student at Parker. My God, she's only nine. Rachel! They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them. They just walked out. The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound. It's starting to hurt now -- real bad. A throbbing. I can't even take a deep breath. I hear them coming upstairs. I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep. So don't talk. Don't say a word or they'll hear it. Please. No don't. You could lose me for good. Don't go through that tunnel. Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it. Elliot -- our driver. The officer put his gun to the back of Elliot's head and -- fired. It was so quick. He pulled us over as we left the Riviera Tennis Club. Claimed we'd run a stop sign. And when Elliot was reaching for his license -- One of them is a cop. No! No police. They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us. They'll kill us. We've seen their faces. No -- nothing. I have no idea. They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows. The shutters up here are nailed shut. They tortured my husband. Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts. Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us. Then hang up! Do it! Because you know you'll be killing us. You won't disconnect. I realize you don't want to be involved. My name is Lenore Oberfeld. My name is -- I don't believe you. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to do this to you. They gave me pills to make me sleep. They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance -- They're holding my husband downstairs. They smashed the phone. I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection. You may be our only chance. I don't know if I can do this again. I can't talk any louder. They might hear. Will you let me explain! You don't understand. I've been trying to get someone -- anyone. For hours ...Max, I'm scared. Are you sure? Seventh, files section. What should I do? In my office? ...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building... Did you say Dmitri? How do you know about my case? I don't understand... If this is a joke, it's not funny. He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell... Max? Oh... ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling... Max... Thanks for everything, Max. Wow... No, no way, I couldn't take that... How often you go? When was the last time you took one? Just had one. Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning. Most of the time. Yeah. Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor... Bottega. You psychic? Like what? You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...? No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money? Why'd you do that? Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics... Different instrument altogether. You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks. Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments. I used to play this piece back in high school. No. You were right, I was wrong... ...Max. Go ahead, say it. You got a deal. We taking bets? What if you're wrong? Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time. Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day. What? Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park....well, last I checked, you were sleeping with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift... ...oh, bullshit! He was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing... ...everything is not about me, don't make me the villain here. That asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...James. I'd like to go back. James... One of my suitors. I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate? My last lesson's next week. James... my car... I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive? You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours? They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally. Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty... Have you seen his penis? Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car? Do you find him attractive? He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen... Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right? I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her. I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you? How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk. Renata tells me you're going to rent a car. No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her. I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months. Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids. It is? The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive. My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station. Outside in the visitors, car park. He was a chemical engineer with a food company. The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk. Well, yes. You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk. Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you. If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you. Not a lot of action here. There, that's better. Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest. No. What about your camera girl? Did she come? In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.Yes. They felt like traffic accidents. Yes. I didn't plan it that way. The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage. I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show. When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now. That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital. That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment. Yes. We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards. I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case. I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said. It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic. Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me. I work in the immigration department there. I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to. Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy. Haven't I? To the airport, if you could. Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped. They said it was here. They told me this morning. After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one? I'm trying to find Charles's car.That's my problem, Belle. I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive. Lying to you -- Why should I? I didn't. He lied to me again. Thank you, Belle -- No, thank you -- what's your name? Jabez -- ? All right, darling. Daniel! ... You must go to sleep. Daniel, you ought to be in bed. Daniel! ... I've stood just about as much as I can bear! Daniel give me that beanshooter! Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel! Jabez -- Jabez! All right, Jabez ... Oh, Jabez! ... Did you hear, Mr. Webster? -- Now you'll help him, won't you? Jabez! It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all. I don't know, Jabez. Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember? But Jabez, I never said that! My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be. Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more. I am going to lock him up. Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes. Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep -- Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep -- Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day. Hello, Jabez -- Here's your son. Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. Jabez -- once you said we'd never change -- No, no. I don't want to be idle. But Jabez -- the washing has to be done -- It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman. Yes, Mr. Selectman! I'll never get my washing done. Oh -- Jabez. I'll get it, Jabez. Jabez -- Don't take cold, Jabez. Come -- it's warm in here. There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come. You'll never change -- will you? Worried! But I'm glad to be home again -- Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day -- We must go on home, Jabez. What do you think of that, Jabez? I'd love to. It feels fine now, Jabez. Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same. Jabez! No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything. Jabez ... Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf. Jabez! Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange. You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think -- Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead? It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens. Not all of it? Do you think I'm grudging it? We can still use my butter money. That's wonderful language. It would move a stone. Who is it? He's stubborn as a Stone. Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer. Oh, Jabez. Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is. He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too. Jabez -- help! I won't forget. You aren't angry with me? I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind! Worried about me! Well, you just stop it! Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself. Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us. Yes, Ma -- I'm ready -- What mountain? What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --? You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez? I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in. Yes, Jabez -- don't worry. That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma. I guess we won't. Coming, Ma. You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty. She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you. Mr. Webster -- you will help him? Jabez ... Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came! Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ? You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault. Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say. Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that. Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner. Of course not -- No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon? -- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster. It is.Belle. But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill. No. She's gone.Oh, my babies. What's wrong? Please do not talk like this. What sort of plan? We are almost out of water. Paul! Then another voice. Let me go. Children get off. No! Sit down now. No. Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins. A little longer, Paul? Please, please try one more time. I will not leave without the twins. A Volkswagen! I want to know. What sort of car? Tell me what it was. What was the bribe? What am I worth to you? Why? What? Yes. In Ruhengeri? I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this? Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof? You cannot go alone. No, no. Go out! Where? What's the matter? So where is the lamb? What for Paul. Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please. You could leave, Paul. But who is left? What about us? My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children. Please go back, bring the children to us. He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi? No, Odette says he's in shock. No answer. Please send someone to get them, please. It will do just fine. I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room. What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me. Paul, don't let them die. What is it, Paul. Oh, my God! Please, Paul, 'til first light. Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence. They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do? I tried already. The phones do not work. Where are Thomas and Fedens? The president has been murdered. Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste. They do not have your connections. Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor. You could have asked for a favor. Why didn't you call your contacts in the army? We must do something. Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake. Do something. Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy. Of course. He wants your wisdom. Yes, with Fedens and the children. I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
