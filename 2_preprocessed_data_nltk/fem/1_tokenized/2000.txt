puffy did you take valium again sonofabitchwhat a journey youve had it seems more than a person should have to bear this is my home im part of the wallpaper roger got me on i wasnt doing anything and but youre back youre really back i would have come to memphis but theres settled folks and theres nomads youre just not a settled folk you never belonged here im doing fine dont you even think about it oh no the prodigal sons home we bring out the store bought that new roof thats your doing it seemed like she had such a good time last time what happened to your pantsi dont want to see your hospital not today leave me now sir i am tired well we must keep in mind the dower laws one third of everything we have is mine and since our negroes have been interbreeding it would be legally impossible to distinguish them dont condescend to me we have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind some things must never change oh indeed you know very well people are frightened of arming the negroes they beg you to consider the future what good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish virginia is outraged with your order allowing negroes to fight in the army theres a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal they wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests well i wouldnt want to trouble you with this now its an antichristian dogma i can not believe you are so calm about it did you know that jefferson has proposed a law in virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church and have you heard anything from our dear friend sally what with all the rumors getting back to england i thought she might inquire after us but then i believe she always looked down on us thats when sally fairfax was tutoring you when you lived with the fairfaxes youre no fool george you never have been and what prize do you see what could we possible gain have you been reading what minister jefferson has to say if he had his way all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome and that would destroy us as surely as a british victory i can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated to be destroyed well a very real expectation is the british will hang you theyll burn mount vernon and theyll hang you our marriage is a business just as surely as my god what but to go to war over trade over money surely theres still time for a compromise war no i did not when you said compromise was possible i believed it was probable theres no middle ground at all were the kings children my god these people mean to go to war they really mean itmankind is born free but everywhere he is in chains well i remember a philosopher who said something that i used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements but which i now see means us all you remember george when we were studying the great philosophers now that is a lie see how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet when you break off your engagement to martha curtis ill divorce william do you hear you get what you want from this world then throw it all away on love is it william says now you have requested a british commission why not colonial ill clear it up for you sir because as a british officer you can lord over colonial yokels more than that it will even get you into polite society your dream come true george the only dream that really matters to you and what is this then been off to fight the french because you are a patriot or is this you gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war george you know i only love you but is that the truth well we cant carry on like animals any longer well the widow curtis will bring you riches position land even halfgrown children you wont have to do anything at all you shant have to do another thing to prove yourself think what the play means william perhaps these words have a place in the real world except for that quite like home england that is oh but you must not mind my talking about you in fact william says my main job here at belvoir is to civilize you to make an honest english gentleman out of you so you are williams wild young neighbor or should i say brother william claims you as a member of his family i have heard so many unflattering tales about you and i understand that except for you this family is quite cultivated voltaire of course remember george it is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong and dost thou live to ask it ive been surprised in an unguarded hour but must not now go back the love that lay half smothered in my breast has broke through all its weak restraints and burns in its full lustre i can not if i would conceal it from thee those people i doubt theyd think of this ooo youre wonderful this color why juba was an african and you want to look the part hold still lets get you darker i dont laugh at you george i like you i like you because you will never ever make it as an aristocrat and thats because youre completely incompetent at hiding your feelings and to think i am teaching you to become one of them is it well im scared of what weve become in our freedom do you when i saw those men yesterday in the field and the women and children in those hovels im not so sure if america is as far from england as id hoped the place to want to be is america every english child dreams of it i dreamt it perhaps you best ask why you wish it you asked william to teach you manners philosophy decorum as i said its completely stupid its stupid of course thats just my interpretation actually its a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners you see walk in a gently z there are four distinct movements in the minuet george every movement is significant like the strut of cranes the word minuet finds its source in minitus which is latin meaning small or orderly capture them well ive never seen anything like it so of course im curious africa thats so far how do they get here where do those men come from georgeyou would have had a full scale revolt on your hands do you want posters too not yet dear brother you want control of the crowd you cant get it by killing their hero you cant do that listen to the mood of the crowd by the emperor of rome this writer asks between a senate that debates truth until they choke an emperor who has the birth sign of a woman is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without encased in the armor of a demigod narcissus the good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast if i ever loved narcissus it wasnt like you want what are you talking about the fans of narcissus they were on vigil outside the school of proximo they believe hes dying why are you so surly youve won brother the people have bread and the city is quiet taking my pleasure do i need to clear my lovers with you youre coming back you cant do that you came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you why not do it in the colosseum if i may be so bold commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father except that he cant heave out his ghost those are priceless sculptures no one in rome has ever heard of him do you want to remind those few in the senate who have the whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with forget about him im sure i dont know if you get me pregnant with a boy hell be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne maybe you should get married pick one of your cousins it would demonstrate a profound stability dont you think you should at least wave and caesar lets not forget to serve caesar i was suddenly thinking about going to bed im tired of being stuck in that wagon thats what you told me two days ago where are we now commodus can you see the camp my gods the air is turning into ice hidden where my brother can not place hands on them he didnt have the guts to watch them die so i took care of it all the sooner he is put out of our misery the sooner will they be safe narcissus i have your family theyre alive all of them marcus would have lived but was poisoned by his son you can not die if you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads but do you remember your epictetus that little homily we recited when we were children the one that was supposed to remind us we were romans for the sake of the gods youre not leading these men how like my father you are you believe i guess thats why youre still alive but you do exist narcissus hero of the battle of the danube i came here to see that you stay alive the people need a living breathing alternative to commodus a hero its my brothers neck you want not mine of course i know who do you think is paying for it the emperor himself didnt you know why do you think commodus came rushing up to the front burning patriotism filial love he wants to be sure when he takes over theres enough cash left in the treasury to play emperor watch out for him narcissus hes inexperienced but be careful how do you know i am playing well the clown is always harmless isnt that right and how did you ever get to know me so well the last we spent any time together i was fourteen i think you know me better than my father hes going to die isnt he why do you keep playing at being so humble its a little embarrassing without him hed be weeping if he overheard that well the idea of you as my adopted brother is very exciting i thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities you know our two most senior senators gaius cantus and falco verus narcissus terrified you the only thing hes scared of is meyou teach them your daughters need more than some vapors they need you i dont want you to die narcissus youre not going you have to stay with us no i dont even want to imagine the things youve seen i never knew a more idealistic man than you let him trust quintus we dont need your help were doing great on our own who else im the one who runs the estates while youre here risking everything we have for the glory of rome or for the glory of you ive been overseeing production myself for the past three years youll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become the battle is over the war is over youve won you need to come home theyre studying with cynics athenians well you wanted the girls to have the best teachers isnt the helmet magnificenti beg your pardon thats right kevin shes mrs kevin bannister she lives in australia i hate to quibble with you rob but she married her first boyfriend kevin bannister really i dont knowwould you really wow i could have deejay rob gordon play in my own home and the new label and the kinky wizards okay dance music for old people music for old people what does that mean whats his name nice friend thats five so why did you decide to deejay again well i wouldnt mind a quick chat if you got the time fine thats great look if you cant think of anything it doesnt matter ill do one my five favorite from the old days at the dodger well if one of them is this sin city thing nevermind any five so four more is there a difference your desert island topfive yeah well lets see what are youre alltime top five records right so you must have an enormous record collection so is now a good time i thought i would ask you a few questions if thats okay well i used to go to the dodger on your nights and i saw youre doing it again and that your putting out a record and its sort of a thenand now story against the backdrop of the chicago music scene with the emphasis on now im caroline fortis from the reader i want to do a story on you im looking for deejay rob gordonwhat are you talking about wheres rob hey barry no no mom wants you to come to the funeral its on friday nothing to resolve ian lets get a drink mmmm no not a good idea im upset but im fine yeah im fine im off the phone i am fine i got ta go goodbye its gon na be fine these people are ready for anything well youve asked i mean maybe youre right but were you really expecting me to say yes ive changed my mind thats the most romantic thing ive ever heard i do i will about what so no i dont think so im just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days fair enough very persuasive dont sulk what brought all this on no probably not well forgive me if i dont think of you as the worlds safest bet im sorry but two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for the reader werent you i know ha ha ha hoo hoo hoo what are you going to talk to me about right are you going to talk to me or shall i get my paper out are you worried about tomorrow night thats okay you seem pissed off all the time though we took care of that theyll go on early nobody will even be there yet and i told them they cant play for more than a half hour yeah his band is playing a set barry said its done what do you ever do that cant be cancelled i had that idea when i was living with ian and it was such a good idea that i was annoyed we werent together anymore it might even be why i came back just local of course yeah and he said its a good way to break out a record especially for what he said and i quote would be a highly anticipated event locally he helped me put out a press release i called dan koretzky because he i tricked you into meeting some people youd think were great i thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a tina turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way i know but youve never met it just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him at paul and mirandas paul from work wan na go to dinner hi what are you doing all im saying is you have to allow for things to happen to people most of all to yourself otherwise whats the use how what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice yeah youre alright but youre certainly not happy so what happens if you get happy and yes i know thats the title of an elvis costello album i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention should we split up because im used to you being miserable what happens if you i dont know start youre own record label and its a success time for a new girlfriend less neurotic are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life more confident maybe i cant go to work with my hair dyed pink and i can afford to go shopping more now and ive met a couple people i like over the last year or so you havent changed so much as a pair of socks in the years ive known you if weve grown apart then im the one whos done the growing and all ive done is change jobs but what because im not allowed to i still do after work so what should we just break up is that what youre saying because if you are im going to run out of patience how how were we the same people money does not matter i do not care how much you earn id just like you to be a little happier in your work but beyond that you can do what you like ill pay for you even though you owe me money we have to do something with the money i earn i need to i deserve it you can just think of it as winning the lottery like mexico or jamaica or new york even look rob if great sex was as important as you think it is and if i was having great sex with him then we wouldnt be lying here now and that is my last word on the subject okay to make you feel better well i was gon na lie and now i cant because youd know i was lying look were okay now we just had a nice time lets leave it at that whats the difference it was like sex what else could it be like want to know what exactly lets go home okay i know its not very romantic but there will be romance again at some stage im sure i just i need you rob thats it and we know each other and we care for each other and youve made it clear that you want me back so rays a disaster i dont know what that was all about except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade i guess and blow it all apart everythings too hard maybe another time i would have the guts to be on my own but not now i dont im too tired not to go out with you i lived with you you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now youre worried i might kill you and youre entitled to worry isnt that a terrible thing isnt that sad yes of course theres nothing to worry about oh rob were not going to go through that again i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today hello it doesnt seem so long ago that i looked at you from here itll have to be sex then i want to feel something else than this its either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm i dont know sometime later listen rob would you have sex with me cmon i dont want to go back i didnt mess things up because i was scared i slept with ray because i was sick of you and i needed something to snap me out of it thank you i appreciate it i cant reciprocate youre also an idiot youre soaking are you going to lie in that flower bed all night lizll give you a lift she knows where to go and everything i dont have time to talk rob ive got too much to do look are you coming or not i dont care as long as you dont expect me to hold your hand my dad liked you and mom never told him wed split because he wasnt up to it and oh i dont know i dont really understand it i think she thinks hell be able to see whats going on its like hes been through so much what with dying and everything that she doesnt want to upset him any more than she has to in a minute when i get it together im sorry my dad died my dad my dad pig died pigsty i cant talk right now hello well think about it youre being deliberately obtuse im sorry to go on about it but i dont know theres a lesson here somewhere and i want to make sure you get it theyre not really though are they i know you bought them for me and that was really sweet of you but that was when you were trying to turn me into you i cant take them i know theyd just sit around staring at me and id feel embarrassed by them and they dont fit in with the rest of whats mine do you understand that sting record you bought for me that was a present for me i like sting and you hate him but the rest of this stuff who the hell is nick lowe or gram parsons or the boredoms i dont know these people i those arent mine oh ho so very infrequently mmm hmm you make me laugh much more than ray does if thats what youre getting at but i already knew you could make me laugh its everything else i dont know about ray i hate ian you know i didnt mind and its not as if rays place is any better fix it up itll make you feel better you know what i mean i dont really want to talk about it to be honest im sure hes at home listen i cant believe he went to the store im mortified actually im really sorry he had no right to do that and i told him so yep i might have missed some stuff im so used to some things being here that i dont even notice them i called and called but you were out i thought id be gone before you got back you dont ever think about other people im not experimenting why dont you go experiment jesus i do not know ill talk to you later im not hold on i figured it was where are you hello call me at work we can arrange to meet properly i dont want this to be the last conversation we have i know what youre like will you call me we can meet for another drink if you want so i can explain it better i owe you that much and anyway i keep trying to tell you thats not really the point is it the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess rob are you there what are you thinking you must have known it would happen you couldnt have been entirely unprepared like you said ive been living with the guy we were bound to get around to it sometime oh rob what do you want me to say is that why you wanted to see me i told you i slept with him so how are you well talk some other time im sorry to call but i need that stuff hi ive been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and im thinking i didnt take them with me have you seen them around will you please just go no i was living with you remember weve slept together but we havent made love not yet but ill tell you one thing the sleeping together is better i havent felt like it well the answer is that i dont know either we havent done it yet you really think it would make a difference either way jesus christ rob is that really whats bothering you is what better better than what just ask it nevermind fine one im too tired for this now i know im asking a lot but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up i need to be able to think while i do it and i cant think while youre here okay okay we have a nine percent chance of getting back together does that clarify the situation i dont fucking know what chance you fucking have oh rob shut up i suppose so i dont know look maybe youll grow up and well get it together you and me maybe ill never see either of you again i dont know all i know is that its not a good time to be living here i am not living with him ive just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what im doing look this has nothing to do with anyone else you know that dont you i left because we werent exactly getting along and we werent talking about it and i suddenly realized that i like my job and i like what my life is could be turning into and that im getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i cant really see that ever happening with you and yeah yeah i sort of get interested in someone else and that went further than it should have so it seemed like a good time to go but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run probably nothing rob dont be childish did you say something what i guess its not that obvious then whats the obvious stuff what were the others what gim me a fucking break is that what you think that your not big enough a deal for me jesus gim me a little credit rob im sorry i havent been very fair to you thats why i came here to the store this evening i feel terrible rob this is really hard you know i think you know that have you tackled the great reorganization yet and do you like it that way you really believe that yeah sure more so then than i am now thats life though isnt it well i liked you you were a deejay and i thought you were hot and i didnt have a boyfriend and i wanted one i remember the song i just couldnt remember who sang it is that right id like a word with him and who says i like marvin gaye anyway whatever and the israelis and the palestinians dont art garfunkel and

lauren shed want it why are there so manyi do every day she was eighteen years old there were four of them they stabbed her fifty three times wheres the fucking accident huh where is it you killed my daughter you mean alex please come inside i would never hurt you or lauren never believe me sweetheart about them youve got to leave it alone they killed her because she found out erin it wasnt supposed to happen no its not what you think looks like you have them both on it still doesnt mean honey its doesnt mean anything its not a message what what is it what is it are you ok what were you yelling about erin erin i know you think shes been talking to you honey i just cant just hold on to meits just that you know i was thinking about how in class youre always telling us that writers make choices at least the good ones and dont get me wrong im not saying the book isnt really great i mean really great but at times its well very detailed you know with the genealogies of everyones horses and all the dental records and so on and i dont know maybe im wrong but it sort of reads in places like well actually like you didnt make any choices at all and i was wondering if it might not be different if maybe when you wrote you werent always under the influence no its not that its i uh i didnt finish i fell asleep sure the keys are on the dresser next to to your book it beats whats your major i dont know grady i just dropped him on a corner i told you sewickly heights who does crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in at first the police thought he just ran away but this afternoon dr gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet he shot the chancellors dog didnt he the blind one i dont know maybe i dont think so i know i shouldnt have but there it was just sort of lying out and i couldnt resist and and i suck grady i thought we were going to talk last night the one in your office its the best one for naps his bag you know that ratty green thing hes always carrying around he mustve left it inside james is odd i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights i dropped him there once but come to think of it it wasnt even his aunts house he said she worked there or something i dont remember some apartment somewhere but ive never seen it i would if i knew where i was taking him i just mean i i guess emily isnt going to be there when you get home so what are you going to do and i love the inscription you wrote to me only im not quite the downy innocent you think i am ive been rereading arsonists daughter its so beautiful grady so natural its like all your sentences always existed just waiting around in style heaven or wherever for you to fetch them down jamesll know about george sanders ail right by the way his friend just checking i think so what about you i think maybe were missing the point it seems to me james strength as a writer is that he doesnt take us by the hand he treats us like adults he respects us enough to forget us that takes courage i havent heard of half of those just a few then the big ones mr crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself only he couldnt remember how are you riding with me jamesits a bathtub what shes standing under he said he hasnt had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks hes kind of a you mean because his careers ruined and all that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit whats that forget it i shouldve known better your friend is just i dont know into collecting weird tricks mind tony now that im home sure it is disturbed and when your friend crabtree gets done with him hes going to be even more disturbed couldnt he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing i need a ride whos he barking at now thats a nice greenhouse why yes how did you know terry was telling me about you on the plane it was all so interestingi know but sometimes did you just make that up it didnt come up i told walter some times oh dozens its very sad and youre old oh grady youre such a putz terry told me about wonder boys is it true did you lose it all i believe you did that nice doctor let you out or is this you improvising again grady i said it didnt sound like you he told me and what do you think you might have said you didnt happen to call the house last night did you grady its within the realm he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education grady are you sure you parked it there grady and the jacket im not very happy with you right now grady but more importantly walters not very happy and hes gotten the police involved they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this you wouldnt happen to know where james is would you grady it seems one of our students is missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed i tried to call but apparently theres something wrong whats he doing out there whos that sitting in your car that and you no i dont think you do and besides i havent decided yet i believe you i believe you want to be with me but this is not just about me anymore gee grady that sounded so heartfelt i dont know whether to swoon or smirk all right did you pass out again grady did you fall somewhere are you limping why are you limping im kidding hello your fingerprints were all over the bedroom did you confess you heard how walters on campus being the good soldier for wordfest but hes a basket case someone stole marilyns jacket last night and poes missing too i cant believe you hung up on me you dick i love you grady pow heavy smells like gunpowder whos gun is that no you dont and fuck you for saying you do and fuck you for saying for saying theres just no way because there could be a way grady no theres no way i mean dont you think theres no way shell come back thats why im going to to not have this baby you love emily i know that and you need to stay with her dont i know what youre going to say almost want to sit up whats the matter you had another one didnt you you have to see a doctor grady first thing monday morning all right i guess youre going to have to chew it off then neither do i and are you going to tell him has he asked to see the book yet my god i wear the same scent as a transvestite she is a transvestite isnt she is that cristaile so i guess we just divorce our spouses marry each other and have this baby right simple shes left before i think walter would find this a little more than surprising im sure im pregnant you go first walter just got it back from the framer today well then id better show you terry thats funny i need to talk to you too perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room professor tripp im sorry its these goddamned shoes i dont know how anyone actually walks in these things i got the message you called professor tripp you want to keep him happy i doubt it darling i doubt id recognize a 63 chateau

against the gain against the whole town everyone just kind of looked the other way they were proving to her they werent they were very drunk things were different back then you think kids are sexually bottled up today they were children of our leading citizens stars of the football team and she was a loner an angry girl that no one really liked shed called them queers no i believed her she was in pretty bad shape inside and out but the boys were never formally charged she was raped at least thats what she claimed years ago something horrible happened in this town when i was still in high

married men head into a private sm chat room that was before he pulled this dick me or i dump you shit i say fuck his best friend no personally i think he has a deep almost pathological desire to corrupt you but i suppose thats a type of love i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me kennyll come running back this is just his way of pressuring you oh nice save i doubt it whod want to fuck

have sex with you youre so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff what am i supposed to say nice sweater mark did you buy it at eddie bauers no thats his table why all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and theyve been married for twenty years the seat behind him is open come on i can eavesdrop too i dont watch him eat everyday why who youre the one whos hand is shaking so are you no you keep one yeah i was talking about twinkies the other day and i realized i hadnt had one in years then i remembered seeing you with one you got a great mom im lucky to get a zucchini stick hi mark cindy ben and she didntoh my god oh my god and get someone to help around the house i can put them in a good school i dont even know how much money that is five million dollars oh my god a number for the whole group or for us its a good day i feel good for what sure wish i had longer to get used to the idea you think if you got no uterus and no breasts youre still technically a woman no hunhuh see thats not what the doctor said he said ones got absolutely nothing to do with the other well then its got ta be a different than whats in our water cause ours is okay the guys from pge told me they sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine and you say this stuff this hexavalent chromium its poisonous an onsite monitoring well that means not around here this is a rough part of the world hard times not a lot of money not a lot of luck its a challenge staying healthy in a town like this heck even our dogs up and die i thought the same thing right off the bat thats why we went to see the doctor but hunhuh turns out ones got nothing to do with the other its a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there the chromium well thats what kicked this whole thing off cause of the chromium you bet paid for a checkup for the whole family and not like with insurance where you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed either they just took care of it just like that we never even saw a bill well they paid for the doctors visit are you kidding with how our lives are if i start subdividing files ill be sunk i just kept all pge correspondence in one place so the whole idea of selling the house dont get me wrong id be glad to move to some better place but if they arent gon na pay us properly i just dont see the point thank you its in remission now thank the lord but you never know and then while thats going on i end up having to have a hysterectomy plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts all benign so far but still no matter how positive you stay an operation can still take it out of you i know theyre more than a bit unusual see two years ago pete got hodgkins disease thats a kind of cancer cause first you got ta move then theres decorating and if the windows arent the same size you know youre making all new curtains honest to god i dont know if i have the energy you know ive been sick me and peter both have thank you i think so too thats why im being such a stickler on this house price thing i dont mean to be a pain in pges backside especially after all theyve done for hinkley but i look around here and i think if they want this place theyre gon na have to pay for it and i dont just mean pay for the house id like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over i added air conditioning put in the pool made all those pillows by hand well it oughta be with all the work i put into it youre a lawyer yesim gon na assume that was meant as a compliment anna and just say thank you what the fuck did you do with my stuff anna with this realestate valuing stuff could you remind me cause im a little confused about how exactly we do that oh hell im dyslexic that asshole smashed in my fucking neck he came tearing around the corner out of control what hey he hit me whats your point yeah theres two why which one yup any school you want its enough for whatever you need for whatever your girls need for whatever your girls girls need itll be enough five million dollars and hes making them give five million of it to you all both the judge came up with a number well then if youre feeling up to it maybe we should talk shop well i was gon na head over to the browns now i was thinking mandy really values your opinion you wouldnt happen to have a little time right now would you donna sure you are youre just a happier woman cause you dont have to deal with maxipads and underwire right but didnt you say he was paid by pge i know but the toxicologist i been talking to he gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure and everything you all have is on that list yeah it was right up on the pge property over there seems like an awful big coincidence your water being messed with and you being so sick well hell maybe thats why you all have been so sick whats chromium the what wow why would they do that they did right but im sorry i dont see why you were corresponding with pge about it in the first place yeah i can see that i guess the only thing that confused me is not that your medical problems arent important but how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff ill say holy moley yeah im real sorry to hear that yeah im real glad you brought that up i was going through your file here and i ran into these medical records they kinda surprised me right yeah i should learn to do stuff like that they make the place feel real homey this is a real nice place you got here hell no i hate lawyers i just work for them you got a minute im erin brockovich from masry vititoe hi donna irving two million dollars what is that ed i swear im not i wasnt gon na here what comes yeah yours is nicer careful you dont spit from here you could kill someone how do you know that say youd be the luckiest son of a bitch on earth if i didnt up and quit over all this say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself say you were wrong oh now dont get all jealous ed i got a little something for you too you know what mr potter i completely forgot your birthday this year and seeing as how youve been so good to me i think that is a terrible oversight so what i been doing over the last few days is ive been putting together a present for you morning no im serious you know what kurt potter is hes the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place hes the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when pge offered 20 million he doesnt work like us ed theres no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing fuck kurt why not the fuck im not i dont care what the doctor says okay good i think i should be the one to tell em cause they trust me more than when where fuck legal terms were talking about human beings here sick people a whole bunch of them are gon na be dead in ten years they need their money now we got ta get em to agree to the arbitration ed we got ta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to im sorry are you saying that if this thing goes to trial itll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money wait what do you mean ten years so why would pge offer it and if you had to guess between 50 and 400 million definitely i know im sorry do i get to hear what happened anyway if youre here to fire me your timings lousy perks jesus perks bullshit you stuck me in siberia dictating to some god damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me after all ive done for you thats the thanks i get how dare you take that away from me not personal thats my work in there ed my sweat my labor my time if thats not personal i dont know what is fun jesus fun i kill myself for a year and a half hand you the best case of your life on a god damn silver platter remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place and you think of me as fun and what im not serious kurt thought what about you do you think anymore bullshit youd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you people dont fly down in their own god damn plane for just a meeting if you tell me to relax im gon na kick your fucking head off not in my world why the fuck should i respect her she insulted me why good counts whats a demur holy shit who do they represent god plus 40 percent of 20 millions a whole lot of money do you think wed do better by going to trial but it wont cover annabelle danielss medical bills so what are you thinking whoa no shit what kind of things come up you might want to think real hard about the amount too my kids are sitting in the god damn parking lot right now cause i still dont make enough to afford good child care makes me think about looking around for a job where im appreciated for shits sake i want my paycheck by the end of the day fuck you make time cause i bust my ass for you i watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet for you and what do you do for me huh you see the way im treated around here but have you ever stood up for me once have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work im doing have you ever bothered saying hey erin doesnt get paid the most cause she has the best tits she gets paid the most cause shes the best god damn employee ive ever had its my paycheck which i earned which i deserve which i shouldnt have to beg for that fatass bitch wont give it to me yeah i mind you bet your ass i mind i want my fucking money yeah yeah im fine no ed what with me running for my life i didnt have time to check those things i dont know big dark some guy in a truck he waited till i was alone then he followed me like two miles jesus im shaking get me a beer someones following me boy this job takes me to some of the best damn places huh dyou get his name course not jesus ed jesus they look like the secret service yeah i heard that one before if theyve sent that little shmuck baum again im gon na be real pissed off well good ed i like working with you too you didnt care about my case really it makes me sick jesus christ ed you know the more i work on this thing the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town then filled it with toxic water and were the ones whove got ta bust our ass proving things thats just not right oh they knew they had to know what do you mean dont give me that youre gon na get plenty rich off of this mr 40 percent we got those pge fuckers by the balls here yeah then gim me another raise no for your information frank cares what was in those ponds cause he used to spend half his day wading around them that was his job i guess it was a little too inconvenient so for fourteen years this stuff flowed into the groundwater free as you please see according to this they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep into the ground but guess what it didnt help but no the real problems on the bottom they covered em over and not too carefully either cause you dig one inch under the surface and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock they used the hex chrom here in these cooling tanks as an anticorrosive then they dumped it here in these six ponds no she lived on the plume you never know another raise wouldnt hurt and with all the time im gon na be spending on the road ill probably be needing my own cel phone wont i youre doing the right thing mr masry kinda like david and whatshisname well i found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967 a hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then four more eleven people so far okay fine i dont know shit about shit but i know the difference we can get these people with a little effort i really think we can nail their asses to the wall and this shit is bad news mr masry not only does it attack every organ of the body it fucks with your dna too that means these peoples genes and the genes of their kids and the genes of their grandkids who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it bullshit okay so heres what ill do ill go on up to ted and rita daniels two of the nicest people youd ever hope to meet who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer ill tell them we cant help them cause you dont feel like working that hard thats crazy why not and i realized hes taking a chance too im the one whos injured and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gon na walk away with almost half my reward boy do i know how you feel first time i heard that number i said you got to be kidding me forty god damn percent mr masry mario gets lost going to the bathroom theyll be driving around the valley for hours and you cant i dont get why theyd do that at least they made an offer so you think we got em scared so far but that place is a pig sty i wouldnt be surprised if theres more ten theres a lot of other places i could work i want a raise and benefits including dental course i did boy you musta really finetoothcombed it then huh and you fired me jesus the ones in the box of files the box of files the one from your office it doesnt take a genius to look at those medical records and think somethings wrong they told her something but it cant have been too specific cause i talked to her and she sure didnt think her water was bad you wan na know you got ta hire me back i got a lot of bills to pay boy are you ever a shitty judge of people now why in the hell would you assume that well that was nice of him isnt it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give em the ax oh yeah what are you doing here bullshit youre trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed fuck if ill help you do that dont bother i left a message ive been dealing with that real estate thing i was gon na write up a whole damn report and i guess im not the right kind excuse me yeah i got it no problem out to lunch with the girls give her a cold washcloth to suck on i got ta go theres a clean one in that bag ill check back in a bit sorry my kid i dont wan na take your money mr masry oh okay thats okay i was wondering could you tell me who id talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck just for the weekend im not everyone else mr masry im someone you made promises to that you didnt deliver on i trusted you with my kids wellbeing now im smart and im hard working and ill do anything but if you think im leaving here without a job you got another thing coming i dont need pity i need a paycheck and ive looked but when youve spent the last six years raising babies its real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn so i figure since youre the one who said i was gon na be okay you should be the one to hire me you said things would be fine and theyre not theres two things i cant stand mr masry being ignored and being lied to you did both you never called me back i left messages yeah well fuck you sorry doesnt feed my kids settle down i got 74 bucks to my name mr masry i cant afford to settle down bullshit you told me id get half a million dollars you told me id be set oh please it was long over by then god damn he made

ill have to terminate hi id like to make an appointment for peter kelson oh peter not a lot book five deuteronomy chapter seven verse five but this shall you deal with them you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire he was trying to tell me something thats his i dont know his grounding phrase for me together no matter what hes been repeating that since birdsons exorcism i looked in every passage in the bible and theres nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything ill be all right peter at the very end i think father was back i saw it in his eyes you have to be experienced to do this just wait outside otherwise you risk killing him maybe i should check lareauxs book its in the car be right back dont go anywhere what are these only your body will remain i believe your soul will be at peace if we kill you satan cant stay until it happens youre still a human being maybe thats my problem i know it is right after my parents died i went to the beach i was in the water everything was calm and then one of those really big waves hit me hard pulled me straight to the bottom i struggled and finally ran out of air if it hadnt been for my sister who pulled me out i wouldve drowned legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me i was desperate i knew you wrote about murders i needed a way in you have to say that im scared im slipping back i see things my worst fears you need to know something peter i was possessed once like birdson it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it sometimes when i feel weak i have thesevisions comfort theres nothing else here he couldnt stop us and thats how he was punished peter what time were you born itll happen at the exact time of your birth your 33rd birthday the transformation will be a perversion of christs rising from the dead townsend discovered it in one of lareauxs books whens your birthday peter let go of the chair get up nothing yet we needed to know all we could the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out townsend he had some of fathers books i dont know i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way i dont know if it works the same way in this instance i dont even know when its going to happen peter i believe your baptism was perverted look at your certificate your mother was the only witness to it your bloodtype doesnt match who you thought your father was peterim sorry then why are you here peter your bloodtype is ab negative theres no way your birth father can be o positive you father is not who you think he is do you know your parents blood types seven years one baptism hes your mothers only brother the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford you were not baptized at least i dont believe it was christian your baptism was performed by your uncle james mckenzie theres no reason why you should this has been planned from your birth you fit all the criteria that we know of never baptized born of incest devoid of faith youre about to become the antichrist who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world i know this sounds crazy i understand check your parents blood types are you sure your parents are your birth parents youre already contaminated its why you couldnt hear the tape theres probably a pentacle near your bed to sanctify you the good outwitting the bad its like birdson had a split personality if youre possessed you cant reveal anything satan wants hidden unless you trick him its true birdson knew your name he was writing it in numerical code it wasnt easy but i figured it out it spelled your name at the exorcism birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man you are that man peter townsend believed just as god became man in christ so satan will assume human form i believe it too please the children peter please thats their explanation you might not believe me i had to youre right i mustve made a mistake youre sure there was nothing what do you mean sowhat did you think of the tape well i think its very simple heres a tape of birdsons exorcism ill be at the public library tomorrow at 2 if you want to meet him on television you seemed so sure of yourself if youre really that confident youd be willing to let someone prove you wrong an exorcism was just held for birdson it failed disastrously which means theres still a demonic spirit present in his body i was wondering perhaps youd like to go meet henry hes pretty amazing last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed you realize how rarely they make that ruling do you remember henry birdson the math professor who won the salwen medal then went home and killed his family in the end the jury saw it my way i murdered my parents mr kelson and while they deserved it i still went to confession the following sunday and i also believe in god and the devil in fact i know they exist what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist that there is no such thing as evil with a capital e and also that you said that malignant narcissism was not evil i saw you on television yesterday you were brilliant peter kelson oh my god look john im facing it you cant back out on me now we need to be sure well see father frank in the morning theres nothing to be done until then we need all the help we can get ive filed a report with father frank ill explain everything later can you meet me tonight i know who he is good seeing you againgood of you to stop by its detective smythe you watch one day ill hit the jackpot get the big house car clothes ill have more money than god sometimes i can just feel the numbers i plan to you want a tipwhen i said quincy could do better i was thinking about you you had your coaches and your father for that stuff it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games thats ridiculous i dont remember that dont tell me you arent ashamed of that because i know oh yes the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife so youre angry with me because youre standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you child please ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say youre the one always turning your nose up at me what do you want me to tell you monica to go beat that girl up to go have sex with him im not going to do that yes i believe thinking of other people is important and yes id rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot if that makes me too prissy for you too bad dont curse you didnt want my opinion in the first place so why even ask find out where theyre registered and send them a gift his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago he could do a lot better if you ask me to that stewardess how is he i can manage hi whenever you lose you get this attitude but its just a game hes still at the bank dont be defensive im just surprised to see you monica what are you doing here tonight dont worry about yesterdays game the recruiters or anything else i just want you to enjoy being beautiful will you do that nothing so good luck sure in between all the other things i have to do child take a bite taste this watch your mouth thats not funny i dont know why i keep hoping youll grow out of this tomboy thing fine you dont like this one which one would you rather wear im lucky i found it someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage oh all that work monica what did you do okay the blue how is she alright looking the way she does she needs to stop running around like a little boy okay you might want to put a jacket on him its getting cold so youre still breastfeeding so that means its alright for you to act like that and if you want a thicker base you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour i just need to lay down ive been running around all day when youre done can you make sure she brushes her teeth really well come on then well no but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older its definitely something i want to do since you love to cook maybe its something we can talk about oh me too i used to cook for my friends parties and things back in atlanta well thanks again this was really nice of you until the black family down the street became the black family next doorhes fine the doctor said it was okay anyway im still trying to lose some of this baby fat whatd you do but you use potato are you okay yeah once i cut

mom thats all you cared about i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two whats ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his womans home cooking and ironing his drawers i do you never stood up for yourself ever if i was ashamed it was because of that i remember when i was eight years old you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal all youd let me and lena do was set the table and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas and you didnt say anything you just threw the whole meal into some tupperware and tossed it in the fridge thats not it im angry because i want a mother not martha stewart because youre pushing me to be something im not i wasnt lena i didnt care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume no i dont so thats why we cant get along because id rather shoot a dumb jump shot there you go i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy whatever so what do i do maybe she is yeah you met her engaged yeah cant wait to see him i just saw quincy need any help what dad around didnt know i needed a reason to come home what what you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say i cant eat before a game well thats what you think isnt it cause id rather wear a jersey than an apron i wont im

trust me trust him he wants us to follow the little boy wait okay okay youre sure of that tell me what happened what happened to charles gish if you believe that then what is he dont you feel there are different sides to every personality maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act were all human not stargher not really hes split himself right down the middle goodevil rightwrong mercifulcruel a monster and an innocent child if i could reach the boy he might tell me about julia the part of him that wants to help that feels shame and remorse who wants to be redeemed this is going to sound terrible but i dont think she matters anymore not to him he never finished her the othershe was able to make them his you were right theres a part of him that knows the truth about what he did about himself you thought stargher wanted to be caught as soon as i met him you knew id say yes he makes julia real for me whyd you bring him here a kingdom his utopia life without consequence or restriction hes not even carl stargher anymore hes this idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases without fear a horrible primitive ugly thing i dont want to talk in here with stargher i saw things just like we all have fantasies right things only we know that we dont share do you feel theres a side of yourself you dont show people agent novak the soul the spirit whatever you want to call it it doesnt have much to do with science do you think thats funny you dont know the procedure i realize that okay lets assume he wanted you to find him that some part of him hated what he was doing most likely that part is dead schizophrenics with whalens infraction sever all ties with the real world im sorry i really am really i dont work with violent cases i work with children but even a kid lies they love it when they get you to believe something that isnt true dont you think stargher would do the same what if he wasnt like this what if he was normal conscious how far would you go i bet we can fix it oh no no you dont who says what now hes beautifulgive a kiss to edward ill come by tomorrow after work with dinner i know i refilled the zyprexa and atavan agent novak i didnt get a chance to clear him damn him four and twenty blackbirds what happened catherine im about to start if you want me to wait or she said convincingly this isnt your responsibility remember that dont let them use guilt as a tool if you want to stop say so he needs to be turned over disorientation nausea migraines hallucinations insomnia paranoia nothing sing a song of sixpence thats my girl henry wants me to try this vietnamese place hes wild about want to come dont bring it home in this i dont want you up all night reading edwards case file of the nine millionth time balance dear girl is the key leave the work here good we need you healthy and relaxed youre going to eat well meditate exercise and watch mindless television youre sure any more nightmares and he might blame you for terrifying him that one moment could erase all youve accomplished and if that happened the trust he has in you is gone yes but youre a willing participant picture edward in a strange place lost frightened if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind it could be devastating for him imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world ive heard this argument before its not happening shush i dont want to find out weve been over this a dozen times no someday you can we all believe that she adores you lucien baines mockylock is the bogeyman mockylock wants me where i am did we go sailing fourandtwenty blackbirds sing a song of sixpence shes bringing stargher into hers whats wrong i hate to admit it but theres something perversely satisfying about this pump in two liters of pure oxygen please henry intravenous administration complete catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy when we started there were a number of test subjects other therapists who acted as receivers all they did was observe and report nothing more but catherine she had the ability to feel what was happening she understood and the patient responded edward engaged her in dialogue took her places showed her things he knew she cared they took care of that thank you henry completely unaware awaiting his arrival thats a secret youre looking well agent novak yes but youre going to sit down right now i have to i doubt that i know your partners here but its very important that youre honest what about narcotics any psychiatric medication i have to ask you some things are you taking any prescription drugs nervous i have done this you know been inside yes that was with edward shes accustomed to his world starghers mind is unfamiliar territory shes lost someone has to go in remind her whats really happening and get her out until then shes at his mercy catherine what about the legalities of this when did he lapse into the comawhere are you going at least shes alive my leicas gone i dont know me too should we bring the police into this oh it is im not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello no i dont think so leave me alone give me money thats what i get from our daughter she has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar if you start in on the war metaphors im going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole because im at the edge of my capabilities robert you might want to pencil in a little facetime with your daughter does this mean youre going to be gone more she asked me not to six months i found some marijuana thats all and a little pipe about two inches long i talked with her she said her friends smoked pot and drank we dont want to push her away these are growing experiences i think she has to find out for herself on her own we have to allow her space why should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is honey this is difficult but weve all had our moments i tried me too its so frustrating so you know we put the case before the arbitration panel none of whom had any expertise superfund is just one of those words people stop paying attention like a grateful dead concert how well do you know this boy seth who was driving you know the police have charged him with a dui and possession of marijuana what do you think i dont know not yet caroline czar for life just like a real czar honey your father knows the presidentits the same stuff from the rainy day stash did you get it i need an introduction to the obregon brothers i know i made things worse i know that and im sorry but arnie i need something from you something only you can help me with that is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us i tried arnie and i will continue to try im glad you think so but im picturing a debtridden thirtytwo yearold mother whose exhusband is being compared to pablo escobar and im wondering who would want to be with someone like that sometimes i wonder what ill do if carl doesnt get out im not very adept at being on my own ive always had a man in my life always dont you have some good news isnt there something positive you could say what about legitimate businesses we own a construction concern real estate please tell me who carl sells to arnie help me doesnt anyone owe us money arnie i need money somebody threatened my children they want a first payment of three million dollars how much do i pay him if all our assets are frozen and our sales force has scattered how am i supposed to survive im giving birth in three months how do i get through this i am on the board of my sons school i had a fundraiser for alv in my front yard i have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman arnie i feel like alice stepping through the looking glass what is he being charged with arnie this is crazy why are you talking like that arnie thank god tell me what to do carl i need guidance not a fucking platitude im not bringing a child into the kind of life i grew up with i wont do it i want our life back how supportive letters from prison while im being kicked out of our home do you have any idea what is happening out here our credit cards are maxed the people at the bank you should see their faces when i walk in there i have a letter from the government telling me that anything i sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging nobody will help us nobody will take us in nobody wants anything to do with us so tell me carl how youre gon na make it up to me tell me again how well get through this and maybe while youre at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection we watched his father get dragged away by federal agents i dont even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when youre coming back or if youre coming back hows david hows david hes terrific carl i keep feeling like im forgetting something just watching you hi womens room stall two should we stop for icecream david especially tiger woods actually he keeps his on the back seat all
