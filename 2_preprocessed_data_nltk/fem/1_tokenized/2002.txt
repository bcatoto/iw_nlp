get up dodge dodge why not did you try wednesday other than the obvious theres nothing wrong with him that i can see not on the outside i dont know what else youd call it hes breathing on his own but his pupils are completely blown out hes totally unresponsive to pain what happened up there im no doctor but id say hes in a coma oh yeah seen a lota movies maybe he isnt alone so we kill him maybe that is his boat im telling you i saw somebody i dont know who it was but i saw somebody i like my job guess ill just keep working what other choices have we got thiss gon na hurt a little or uninvited guests if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago we just hit the jackpot ever heard of insurance big boy bring it on dude supposing one of those cables breaks under tow out here what so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now no roger maureen maureen what one more amidships starboard at the beam just under the waterline i dont think its a problem i cant believe you dodges dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share nothing lets get outa here yeah fine i just thought i heard something is all better than starving to death sudden flashes of light headache nausea lights any dizziness because of the gold youre a pal maybe six feet lanky i didnt get a good look he was far away but i saw him i saw him as sure as youre standing there thats a good thing thats what i call a payday probably didnt have time you mean before she sank looks like one hell of a stick up his ass could be a fishing boat showed him a hell of a lot more than that morning everybody maybe twenty gallons an hour i dont give a damn about the gold its a trap there was no way we were gon na get away with that gold nobody ever does its just the bait this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out its the ship the ships making you think this way murphy dont you see whats happening and now youre gon na kill me is that it so you killed them you killed them greers gone he broke out of the tank what what happened if the weather holds it might not be so bad they went crazy maybe it was more than that could be a stroke who knows the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves like wild dogs what do we do with him right here nope epps over just lucky i guess i dont know she said the ship was evil that we had to leave right away that if we didnt we might never leave more than just a mutiny more than just the gold something bad happened here murphy no i think they are were just passengers innocent victims what happened maybe hallucination is the wrong word it was more than that as though they were showing me i dont know what else youd call her one second she was there the next she was gone no someone else a girl im not sure she was real when you found me yesterday at the pool id seen something someone are we smart enough to avoid that the what what do you think happened on this boat couldnt sleep hey its not gon na hold us its a good bet theyll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too maybe the other ship took the worst of it the pages missing then their sos was real their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision distress calls have been made the same day she supposedly went down the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill but who what only something mustve gone wrong youre saying they mutinied for the gold theyre dead in the water that morning four hours later the captains relieved of his command and that evening they issue a general sos same any luck he needs a doctor greer yeah just a bird just a stupid bird epps yup no cowboy shit right guess thatd be me again so we find this guy and make a deal with him it wasnt you it was somebody else theres somebody else aboard of course im sure i saw him i saw him just a minute ago some guy theres somebody else on this boat the guy he just came this way did you see him why not call for help maybe they didnt want it back maybe the whole fat deal was insured youre more practical than superstitious you think shes sailing without a crew so what did happen nope well suppose she got a little further north than she should have got stuck in the ice the passengers and crew evacuated she froze into the ice pack which moved further north where it froze in solid they write it off fifty years later the whole global warming thing happens the ice melts she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her she was sailing up north right whatd you find up there coffee they mustve scuttled it nobody just lets a ship float away go on its my pen namerun im sorry john but you have to run again shes not alive but she didnt die she grew up the drowning woman anne but it was too late her little girl was already gone cant you see she just wanted her little girl back i am going back i see myself there i always wondered what the world would be like but now that ive seen it i dont need to see any more its all right once im in the tank i wont remember any of this the other two will die without me i have to go back where are we going but you still have a choice the others never had a chance to see their future you did please i want to go back anderton what is it please anderton leave wait he wont no follow him do it right here on the ground drop some money can you see the balloon man take it theyre inside is it now is it now can you seethe female its always in the more gifted of the three sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark actually i think youll have to run out but yes thats what you have to do if you have one inside the precog who predicted it all you have to do is download it the safest place of all i said the record is destroyed the original report exists for all time i designed the system so that whenever a report occurred it would be stored in a safe place but not declared you shouldnt you shouldnt trust anyone certainly not the attorney general who wants it all for himself not the young federal agent who wants your job not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what hes created dont trust anyone just find the minority report hold that thought but you will bring it down if you kill leo crow why that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime didnt work do you really the system would collapse yes of course he knew but at the time he felt we both felt their existence was an insignificant variable i used to joke with lamar that we were the mother and father of precrime well in my experience parents often see their children as they want them to be not as they are im saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might just might have an alternate future obviously for precrime to function there cant be any suggestion of fallibility after all what good is a justice system that instills doubt it may be reasonable but its still doubt because these minority reports are destroyed the instant they occur most of the time all three precognitives will see an event in the same way but once in a while one of them will see things differently than the other two i cant help you no one can the precogs are never wrong how can you avoid a man youve never met and yet a chain of events has started a chain that will lead inexorably to his death so many of them despite what we did for them or maybe because of what we did to them it doesnt matter its a perfect system now isnt it back then he was still a da and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom you have to understand these people were the dregs of society but once they saw their children he decided he would do whatever he could for them hes that way you know paternal about certain things precrime the precogs you it began as play a guessing game like you play with any toddler except these children always guessed right and then the nightmares started they were all different but all the same they were all about murder and the murders were all happening you think the three in the tank come from a test tube theyre merely the ones who survived the innocents we now use to stop the guilty im not i was trying to heal them not turn them into something else if the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention then yes i invented precrime and how would i know that just what is it you think i can do for you you have three minutes to tell me what youre doing here before i feed you to a few of my more predacious plants the vine the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall yes im afraid that would be from the dolls eye something wrongjohn what is it i know i do too about who think john why would they set you up found where then who was he then how did he oh god what did you do john anne lively but i never said she drowned lamar no i dont think you do the other day when he came to the cottage he talked about a lot of things but danny witwer the man he was supposed to have just killed he didnt mention him he didnt say his name even once no thats what everyone thinks john shot a man dead in baltimore six months before lamar do you know the reason why john came here to work with you he also said crow was a fake john said something about him being set up because he found out about her anne lively john was talking about her right before they took him i thought you were retiring you look great no it isnt lamar there was nothing anyone could do i havent seen him in two years to what trap him i left him because every time i looked at him i saw my son every time i got close to him i smelled my little boy thats why i left him and now you can leave he shot a hole in the damn ceiling so what you lose your son lets see how well you handle it the fbi found something that belonged to my son a sandal anyway john was upset he he it wasnt a suicide attempt i regret ever saying that yes it was nobodys fault since right after we lost our son that was our apartment no but then i dont talk to john that much

setshhhh just stay with me stay with me everything is forgiven everything you must have been dreaming when ive decided that if it is god its a sick god its ambitions exceed its powers but it doesnt realize it its created a situation without a goal and i hate that a god whose passion is not a redemption who saves nothing fulfills no purpose and us we would have to have an arrangement an unspoken understanding that i am not human how can i not hate something that does that i dont know something anything what are you taking am i really her i cant i have consciousness but i am not mortal dont you see why im going crazy they do something to me its hard to think straight i want to stop taking those pills but then i would be dead now did you hear what gibarian said im not a human being im an instrument i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what even if i remain passive thats when i drank the i was going mad it felt like there was no body underneath my skin there was something else an illusion but i could feel my heart beating and i remembered you tested my blood is it like yours i i am rheya but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago thats impossible im not rheya youre lying what do i have to do to stop it chris please chris im serious i wont make it chris you never said you wanted one chris i had to i had to i didnt think youd react like this it wouldnt have made any difference dont do this i am literally begging you not to do this chris then youll die youre lying im not human im disgusting dont call me that im not rheya youve always known that how could it be so cruel how could it torture us like this how can i tell youve seen both of me i only know what youre like here youre all i know there is no you from before dont im the one at risk here if were playing out what happened before i wont survive please dont lie i told you before i dont know how i came to be here whatever you think you cant say to me i need to hear you say it whats happening to us you said he was dead whats wrong if youre here do you want to stay here but thats what happened before i have these strange thoughts i dont know where they come from i cant explain it thats what you were saying i heard what you were saying you dont want me im just as human as you i see i hear i touch and i feel just like you do youre the coward i dont think do its not sleep its something else its all around me i love you too was she right why did she do it but we fought im just trying to understand whats going on sartorius that i am not rheya that rheya died killed herself im different you dont love me im glad do i really feel like i am it was obvious from the way he first looked at me you feel sorry for solaris or for me he has a point sartorius wants to destroy it what does snow think you should do you sure say god a lot when were doing it you know ive decided im just gon na believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing itll make life so much easier the little wife agreeing with her big strong husband you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day i like that too good because i want you to know i really like fucking you do you have any idea how much i like fucking you i cant help feeling that im cheating when i take them why did you say those things what happened to us exactly thinking what you were doing and saying just being consumed by thinking of you i loved it so much that feeling scared no not scared wary like i was something to be her guard went up i was a threat now i know why she was afraid shed be seen that i would see her for the selfobsessed neurotic that she was i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal but thats the cycle right i knew a little more than she did she knew a little more than her mother and on and on i guess thats part of the reason why seven eight so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space and she asks me what im doing and i start trying to explain to her about this state that i can put myself in and this look comes over her face i would have these i dont know how to describe them visions when i was younger maybe not visions but like these waking dream states time would just collapse i would be inside time i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped freaky stuff i been thinking about how much i hate you when i saw you were gone i got scared what happened as i said then its god right but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang even a god that wasnt active that just created something and stood back and watched you still dont believe in god then its god right is it intelligent is it a planet yes but not until you mentioned them as soon as you said those things i remembered them and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember its like filling up what do you mean i know i know but still somehow i dont feel better you talk like an actor you go home and i just want to know if im crazy or not if what i think is happening is actually happening or am i one of those people those women who are blind to whats going on who pretend not to see their husbands attention toward another woman you behave as though you want to fuck her you want to fuck her better i wasnt not a very happy poem my thomas is a little rusty book i want you inside me
