look father ah just because i dont subscribe to the to the beliefs you subscribe to what business is it of yours who told you this what does this have to do with why do you call it an investigation i never have no wasnt it what happened to the baby agnes what happened to the baby i doubt thats what shed say before or after you killed the child you tied the cord around its neck and the baby you hid the wastepaper basket in her room you wanted that child out of the way you went to the room to help with the birth the baby too late for what for what an abortion and you didnt send her to a doctor did you know she was pregnant was it you who knew she was pregnant i have a few more questions to ask her where is she who was that person mother was it you because its murder were talking about arent you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room oh would you stop lying mother somebody told her theres a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn did you know about that theres an answer mother thats how she got out thats what i have to believe but she is not an enigma mother everything that agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry one two three right down the line but what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you wont face the fact that she was raped or seduced or that she did the seducing i thought you didnt believe in miracles today mother but how did it happen youre saying god did it this is insane well give me a reasonable explanation how my god youre as crazy as who is he how how she hallucinates stops eating and bleeds spontaneously is that supposed to convince me she shouldnt be touched give me a miracle you think shes a saint for the church one that will ask the questions you want asked youre what no no i said leave her alone of course no the hypnotism do you still disapprove id like to begin do you think agnes is still attached to god well you can try cant you to be good do you want to become one do you think they ever existed right what do you suppose todays saints are smoking oh youve come a long way baby right saint peter hand rolled long thin and filtered do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then all right would you like one huh my sister died in a convent and its her voice i hear does my smoking bother you no because i yeah yeah i left the church cause i had freckles i wasnt i wasnt she was the pretty one she died why not me i never said my morning prayers and i was ugly i was scrawny i had buck teeth and freckles all over my face do you know what the nun called me sister mary clitus called me polkadot livingston thats all thats enough she was a beautiful little girl it wasnt sex it was a lot of things but it wasnt sex you know when i was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school you know what the nun said she died because she hadnt said her morning prayers nothing you just said catholic church doesnt have a corner on morality bullshit then why did you call the police in the first place mother huh an unhappy woman i dont give a damn about her spiritual health the womans health is at stake dont deny it id like yours too oh god why didnt you do anything to stop her why didnt you you knew she was keeping her home from school you knew she was an alcoholic there is more here than meets the eye isnt there lots of dirty little secrets she molested her do you know what she did to her listening to angels like keeping her home from school and agnes father no it just makes you doubly responsible doesnt it your niece you lied to me sister paul when was that what sheets what is it was the child full term take at look at it do you have a a diary or a day book visitors to the convent do you remember anything unusual happening at the time when would agnes have conceived the child answers innocence legal innocence i know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court aquittal theres another choice no youre shielding her let her face the world then help her virginity right mother poverty chastity and ignorance is what you live by and she has a right to know that theres a world out there filled with people who dont believe in god and arent any worse off than you mother people whove gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once to anybody and people who fall in love and have babies and occas sionally are very happy she has a right to know that but you and your your order and your church have kept her ignorant or bullied or what ever youre doing who the hell do you think you are you go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child how dare you think im in a position to be pressured how dare you tell me to run my affairs i havent said anything against the the catholic church i hate ignorance and stupidity what and i intend to take her away from him thats what youre afraid of isnt it its being doing it for centuries shes not unique shes just another victim not simple no she has it now she had a a hole in the palm of her hand she could have bled to death why didnt you take her to a doctor this was before her pregnancy and what happened and you werent shocked when did you first learn about her innocence the way she thinks well its been known to happen in the day too maybe agnes went to him that possibility never occurred to you one of the other nuns found out about the baby and and wanted to avoid a scandal its possible isnt it that she was unconscious yes so someone easily could have come in the room and killed the and in your eyes so someone else could have done it if shes so innocent how come she murdered a child thats ridiculous how could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth from other nuns yes i ive noticed whats your opinion i am not with the inquisition the science of psychiatry well im the doctor im the one whos going to decide what is or is not important here why do you think that look someone gave her the baby why havent you asked her and you didnt try to find out who could there have been anyone else whats his name was there a priest what man had access to her who was the father didnt she have any physical examinations in this time how did she hide it during the day is that normal how did she hide it from the other nuns who knew about agnes pregnancy i can beat that you were a smoker thank you yes ithat was the beginning the night of the conception thats why she burnt the sheets for what should you see a doctor what do you mean a few years ago one of the sisters came to me in tears asking for comfort comfort because she was too old to have any children not that she wanted to but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility say it how many times have i burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of why then tell me where are your sheets it made them uncomfortable and if they didnt sleep well im certain the next day they were cranky as mules sister where are your sheets do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin were not in the middle ages sister why sister marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress sister is that true dear jesus why yes of god my dear i dont think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything youve got to eat something agnes nonsense im your mother now and i want you to eat your mother tells you this agnes your mother is dead who oh my dear child agnes dear heaven is not a place where thats not what he meant who tells you these things agnes why who told you this he loves you the way you are you neednt worry about being attractive here why does it matter whether youre fat or not agnes oh for heavens sake who one of the other sisters why who through someone else he talked to you himself agnes it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating why is this agnes ive been commanded by god oh dont do this she cant remember thats enough then shes a liar i left it with her and i went for help i wanted her to have it when noone else was around they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them but it was such a difficult birth there was so much blood and i panicked no i didnt hide it i put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets thats a lie she didnt want any help the scandal i dont know too late to stop it oh dont be ridiculous i didnt guess until it was too late yes is it because shes a nun why do you insist upon pressing my god but youre determined hasnt she had enough this is permission to take her apart if you believe this is murder it is the crown attorney you have to talk to not me and definitely not agnes im concerned about her health why would i lie who that tun that tunnel hasnt been used in fifty years thats crazy how could she find out about it then why are you so obsessed with her youre losing sleep over her youre thinking about her all the time youre bent on saving her why thats what you believe she is the sum of her psychological parts she is an innocent but i want the opportunity to believe i want the choice to believe youll never find the answer for everything god did there as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out a miracle is an event without an explanation if shes capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail why couldnt she split a cell in her womb dont be ridiculous stop laughing i dont say its the truth im saying why must he be anybody the father shes been touched by god yes for agnes one that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect if we want to hire a psychiatrist for agnes well find our own thank you ive just met with the bishop were taking you off the case stop this shell hurt herself im not going to allow this then lets begin may i be present would it stop you if i did begin what listen to her singing yes but goodness has very little to do with it not all the saints were good in fact some of them were a little crazy but they were still attached to god agnes has that birth no more were born we live we die no room for miracles oh my dear how i miss the miracles become one is born a saint yes i do there are no saints today good people yes but extraordinarily good people those im afraid we are sorely lacking and saint john would chew tobacco mary magdelen pipe even christ would partake socially saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet and of course undoubtedly not the ascetics of course but well saint thomas more fine thanks im out of prac practice id love one no it reminds me so you left the church because you had freckles and what has that to do with it stupid woman and thats all what have we done to hurt you and dont deny it i can smell an excatholic a mile away what did we do burn a few heretics sell some indulgences that was in the days when the church was a ruling body we let governments do those things today so what did we do to you eh you wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldnt because it was a sin what the hell has the catholic church got to do with you who said anything about the catholic church bullshit yourself because i am a moral person shes happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone i know you dont her spiritual health i havent decided yet well see about that and my permission because i didnt know i knew that after the fact oh god if only id known oh dear god i dont think i care to know she drank too much thats what killed her yes i never saw agnes until she set foot in this convent my sister ran away from home we lost touch with her and when my husband died and i came here she wrote to me and asked me if i would take care of agnes in case anything happened i didnt tell you because i didnt think it was important about what yes i dont remember where agnes was i was needed in the sick room the twenty third of january on that night one of our elder nuns passed away oh dear god i should have guessed the sheets oh dear god theres nothing here yes nothing earthquakes oh some time in january all right what do you need how what what good would it do no matter what you decide its either the the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin i am i am not a virgin doctor i was married for twenty three years two daughters i even have grandchildren surprised it might please you to know that i was a failure as a wife and mother my children wont even see me any more thats their revenge i think they tell their friends that ive passed on and dont tell me im making up for past mistakes doctor freud she is not a child im only interested its my affair too catholicism is not on trial here i want you to deal with agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else the catholic church nuns you hate nuns you hate us dont you gods victim thats her innocence she belongs to god i saw it clean through the palm of her hand do you think hysteria could do that i know what youre thinking shes a hysteric pure and simple but she didnt did she if anyone had seen what id seen shed be public property newspapermen psychiatrists ridicule she doesnt deserve that it was healed by the following morning and she started eating again about two years before she stopped eating completely i was appalled just as you are now shortly after she came to us oh come on youve talked to her she doesnt even know how babies are born let alone made this convent is locked solid the only one that has a key is sister marguerite and she wouldnt let christ in after dark noone knew about agnes pregnancy noone not even agnes thats absurd who you dont really believe something like that happened do you ive already told you what i thought no not in the eyes of the police she didnt this is manslaughter not murder she didnt consciously kill that baby shed lost a lot of blood she was unconscious by the time we got to her in her case it isnt shes had very little schooling her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died agnes came here to us shes never been out there doctor shes never seen a movie or a television show shes never even read a book because shes an innocent shes a slate thats hasnt been touched except by god from other people i believe she is not crazy nor is she lying i believe agnes is different well what do you think is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre or maybe shes perfectly sane and just a very good liar and i am not from the middle ages i know what you are i dont want that mind cut open exactly i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible she wont hold up under any sort of cross examination look doctor i dont know how to tell you this politely but i dont approve of you not you personally dont ask me those questions dear im not the patient yes but that was some ten months ago i fail to see that the identity of that

foolish there was a time when i would have welcomed it there was a time when i thought you might have stayed you should not bother with that birdhouse if youre leaving tomorrow i see but i hope you have a lot of sugar eli is ready to go to zooks when will you be going but you may not be well enough im sorry im sure it is whacking is not of much use on a farm what else can you do you know carpentry we had some lemonade and he left eli is a fine carpenter best in the district he and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago oh the bullets you can go with eli hes taking samuel to school but youll have to hurry but stoltzfus said well the store at saltzburg but you wont be going to saltzburg for a while telephone the gunthers across the valley theyre mennonite they have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even you make fun of me like the tourists driving by all the time some even come into the yard very rude they seem to think we are quaint vain proud such a person is hochmutsnarr he is not plain buttons are hochmut i should tell you these do not have buttons see hooks and eyes yes its good that someone can have the use of them besides in your clothes youd stand out to strangers your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood i have them soakingyou can wear these enjoying your reading its not the gun dont you understand its you what you stand for that is not for samuel john book i would appreciate it if during the time you are with us you would have as little to do with samuel as possible you tell him when youre able but you cant two days what only the elders the leadership of our district the diener bishop tschantz is the one with no hair on top they decided to come and see you for themselves except stoltzfus of course he came the first day i think he saved your life but  but why but john why didnt you go to a hospital what about samuel will you come back to take him to trial stay for awhile rest ill make coffee and breakfast you said we would be safe in philadelphia you couldnt wait until morning where are you taking us now im afraid im afraid for samuel i want to go home but why would they murder why dont you arrest that man are you protecting him because policeman oh yes she thinks you like policing because you think youre right about everything and youre the only one who can do anything and that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a um bag of elbows she thinks you should get married and have children of your own instead of trying to be a father to hers except she thinks youre afraid of the responsibility your sister said you dont have a family but not a good tired i would not be too sure no youre not  youre glad because now youve got a witness i heard the other police talking last night they dont seem to like you very much we do not go into your courts yes and i also want to leave this city the problem is i dont happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people he wants to know who you are your name i told him we dont need to know anything about you its not a joke you dont understand we have nothing to do with your laws you have no right to keep us here where are you taking us samuel samuel lapp but what happened here is none of his affair my sister is expecting me our train is leaving soon you just wouldnt its not the amish way but i think it would have done me good if i could have screamed at your brother last night at home youd never hear a woman scream at a man that way fred the way he looked when you screamed at him i made it a contest the one who does best gets his cereal back first children like to help they only need to be kept after a little bit just a minute ill pour you some coffee i wanted to you were kind to take us in last night anyway i needed something to do i was so angry with your brother hes so agaanisish good morning yes yes thank you very much i have to help him you shame yourself i will be the judge of that i am not a child that is idle talk i have committed no sin i have done nothing against the ordnung eli john is a carpenter as well as being a fine policeman i know god help me i know that eli but i tell you that if hes found here the people who did this to him will come for samuel well pray that he doesnt die but if he does then well find a way so no one knows i know no his name is john book yes samuel were going john lost control of himself he will be repentant hes from ohio my cousin
