did a beautiful job pink and gold are my favorite colors oh royalty oh well theyre really gorgeous as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel ive ever seen oh its beautiful my god this place is fantastic isnt it honeverything on it sure especially if youd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go well you should because i appreciate you too you know clark stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name nobody expects you to be what youre not superman im fine what was i talking about before see what happens when i dont have my orange juice the human body is only a workable fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect youd show to gee please dont tell me youll find somebody else someday cause well you are a pretty hard act to follow youll have to admit that oh ill get by dont worry about me oh im not blaming you i just know me id be jealous jealous of of all humanity some rival huh everybody everybody else id be buying my little rainbow at the their expense all the ones who say help come quick now i know who youd have to pick oh when it comes to you i am not that i dont understand why they all need you but they cant need you more than i do me too oh i tried to convince myself believe me its like being married to a doctor i said doctors are practically never at home the get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it then a voice said could you be a doctors wife or are you too selfish i know i know all the arguments you dont have to tell me thats what i did all night i listened to the voices of reason till the dawn came up do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when youve been up night crying never closed my eyes oh hi dont its not your fault you didnt know but what can you do theres no way now i dont want a bodyguard i want the man i fell in love with lets get you inside clark it doesnt matter we can move you did it you gave it all up for me i i dont know what to say your place maybe i should change maybe you should too i want to whats happening oh is that the understatement of the year well so where do you want to talk im listening im in love with you how do you feel well not in your mind but maybe deep in your heart maybe you wanted to i was right you are superman its true its true oh clark no because of what im betting my life uhuh listen ill tell you what you say im wrong and i say im right so why dont we make a little bet on it listen ive got to give you credit your disguise is nearly perfect i mean if you fooled me and i am nobodys fool dont fake me out clark or whoever you are and you werent as usual what do you say to that i mean it strikes me funny that every time superman comes around you disappear where were you frankly once youve seen superman in action niagara falls tends to leave you cold aw cmon anybody can get hungry hey are you hungry im hungry thats because you can hardly see through those things mr smith the complimentary couch oh sure everything is complimentary until you get the bill yeah thanks i mean really posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in niagara falls i mean imagine wasting a great reporter uh reporters on this perry white and his sunday magazine exposes hah some guys say i have magic fingers in july of course thats what friends are for clark everything i was saying cant you see i only say it because i really care be my guest havent you heard theres an energy crisis no this was good enough for my mother well you shouldnt be more aggressive clark trust your instinct when you see your opportunity grab it i do sure but nobody knows it least of all you look would you mind if i gave you some constructive criticism of course not not when youve got so much going for you oh sure the american answer to everything pills no this is natural well you never will again thanks to vitamin c im reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of vitamin c every day when was the last time you heard me sneeze do i detect a note of jealousy then maybe you should get your glasses checked but him is you now im confused it must be tough having to be clark kent hey dont worry youll be fine just well dont rush it like it its magnificent not that it couldnt use a womans touch especially around dinner time i must be but im not your home this is your home the bomb its in there any second now its superman the
