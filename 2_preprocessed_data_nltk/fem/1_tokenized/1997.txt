point of being insulting i will never have sex with you ever if you were the last man on earth and i was the last woman on earth and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation i still would not have sex with you i hope this is part of the unfreezing process what sure we dont use the term negro anymore its considered offensive a chigro mr powers please i know that you must be a little confused but we have a very serious situation at hand i would appreciate it if youd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest im sorry excuse me i beg your pardon i went to oxford and excelled in several subjects but i ended up specializing in foreign languages i wanted to travel see the world in my last year i was accepted into the mod in the cultural studies sector i thought i was off on an exciting career but my job was to read everything printed in every country its very boring my whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in farsi if i do

hes asleep greathis peritoneum has ruptured 90 over 50 and falling ive got a pulse hes alive you didnt hear it you must have heard it whats happening nothing its nothing starck the dark inside i dont understand what does what justin what shows you ill get back to the log but on the bridge i wont go back back in there justin i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin yeah im im okay skipper crystallized frozen i found one everythings been shut down conserving power i guess green light on the hull its intact okay im on the bridge theres no one here skipper i can see the hatch i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing that means they didnt abandon ship jesus its huge weve got pressure no no its alright i talked to my ex hell keep denny over christmas and ill get him this summer goddam it skipper i havent seen him in two months just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers good for four months ive seen bodies before this is different about an hour ago in medical i saw my son he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were i did theres no one here blood looks like arterial spray dr weir whats this the door to heres another one theyre all over the place dj its okay youre okay just breathe they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan the shuttles ohtwo tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen there was a spark and both ships were incinerated the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat captain miller was able he served on the goliath dont worry about it hes hard but hes fair youre lucky to be shipping out with him hes one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach first time in a grav couch i dont care you got any coffee we have to do something oh god come on babybear open this door do you know what it was yes yes justin we heard it can you shut it down theres no one in the corridor but usrun hurry i dont know the process dr weir was the expert there must be a way what about engineering youre okay now its over i dont know the screens are dead it is not weir miller hes back he was in the tank ill do it blow it up weve got to shut it down weve got to weir cant be alive five seconds you better hurry hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit justins in the airlock miller come in nine hours and twentytwo minutes i thought you wanted an answer and thats the only one i have i know that its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports i didnt say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us youve got to listen there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you you saw what you saw we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged what if there were a connection between the two the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system ive got a theory i ran the bioscan with the dnarna filter the results were bioreadings of indeterminate origin miller who maybe one of the original crew i can reconfigure the scan for c12 amylase proteins whats the point ill just get the same thing i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew the event horizon sensors show the same thing bioreadings of indeterminate origin right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels i thought of that with the filters from the clark weve got enough breathable air for twenty hours after that wed better be on our way home its building up with every breath we take and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot oxygen is not the problem the antennae arrays completely fried weve got no radio no laser no highgain no ones going to be coming to help us it tastes bad were all here thats an affirmative theres not enough radiation to throw off the scan im picking up trace life forms but i cant get a lock on the location somethings wrong with the bioscan crossing the horizon optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees i just finished drying ion drive will engage in tminus ten minutes were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready its cold skipper justin just activated the door its on a thirty second delay almost got it keep him talking hes engaged the override not according to the computer what if the air has gone bad we cant wear these suits forever im trying goddammit miller do you read me peters decompression wouldnt do that what happened to his eyes picking up magnetic interference the scope is lit its right in front of us if they are theyre screening their calls this is us aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read this is the lewis and clark hailing the law of relativity prohibits faster thanlight travel all boards are green everythings five by five smiths right neptune theres nothing out there if something happens well be on our own justin said something about the dark inside me what did he mean miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock what is it in our current environment dr weir selfcontrol is an asset what are you doing maybe a power interruption crashed the system im sorry it must be hard being so far away from her claire is your wife why dr weir i think youre in love i cant believe we built this i dont know the life readings just went off the scale what is it if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship it doesnt make any sense affirmative the hulls intact but theres no gravity and the thermal units are off line im showing deep cold the crew couldnt survive unless they were in stasis the reactors still hot weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably nothing serious a straight line howthen set out the good plates well all have lunch my office will follow up with details jumping off now security what the hell you talkin about your base isnt secure jordan dear how are they treating you awright hows our girl doin anyway well seeins how this thing is out you let me handle the rpm from this point forward i want all press matters coordinated via my office ill be goddamned if im gon na watch hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one him or the president this my shade midnight mahogany cuz im comin dangerously close to lookin like ronald reagan here are you truly mouthin off to a senior member of the senate arms committee i mean ill give you points for style just nothin for smarts and now i got reporters from toadsquat iowa calling my office and askin what i know about this gi jane thing commander are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin their fill these were supposed to have been discreet test cases she made it through sere training got a call this morning from yes think i overplayed it ill act surprised that aside for the moment im struck by the tenor the illspirit of your report the degrading remarks by other aviators innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior in my seven years on this committee ive never seen a downed aviator treated like this never im deeply disturbed by this report mr hayes not just what it bodes for women in the military but for your own confirmation as well id like to think our next secretary of the navy would be prepared for anything mr hayes yes i see your signature right here twice the size of everyone elses and your conclusion was pilot error hmm the navys conclusion regarding the crash of an f14 aboard an aircraft carrier female aviator it just so happens youre familiar with this report and its conclusion am i right the lark report well im just an old dame without much time left so youll pardon me if i jump right in here before they discontinue my bloodtype i am deeply concerned over the navys seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military case in point whoa whoa whoa landbased maritime specialties gim me a second here to deeuphemize that well i spoke with mr hayes this morning myself and told him the deal was off no more test cases he was only too happy to oblige dont play politics with me little darlin youd be up way past your bedtime youll think about my offer ive had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began and thats quite verifiable i once promised you a fast ticket jordan and i always meant to make good on that come work for me i can always use a hardcharger on my team the reality is this we send far too many men off to war i dont need to compound the problem with women can you honestly tell me you wanted that life squatpissing in some thirdworld jungle with jordan i dont expect you to fully understand this but sometimes theres more to be gained from the fight than the victory im saying its not going to happen not when the president is set to turn this into a thirdrail issue should i choose to ever campaign against him he will fry me six ways to sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war and quite possibly for bringing them back in body bags in face i do roper harris gallop they all come back the same what he did was light the bandwagon on fire because he knows what i know that american families are not prepared to put their daughters in harms way should probably ask him that wickwire was there to help to be my eyes on the inside to make sure you were getting a fair shot at least that was the intent absolutely not jordan might we do this over lunch tomorrow i do very much want to talk but now is scarcely sounds familiar jordan i always hoped wed get together though just now im gearing up for a childcare vote that gon na be visiting that allwomans americas cup team in a few weeks if i were a gambler id say dennis oconners days are numbered but theyre in san diego so i thought id take a quick promenade of the base hmmm maybe ill ask when i see you in person therell be more to follow but yes dear right now youre the pick of a very large litter and your success would mean a lot jumping now yes dear my office will fill him in and help expedite look forward to meeting you at the proper time jumping off now this is just a test case oneil but if it works out if you work out it could well change the navys official policy on women in combat or actually its official nonpolicy now whos your immediate superior there california highschool pentathlete rotc scholarship graduated with honors top marks in basic training and as it just so happens a constituent of my home state of virginia oh the things ill do for one extra vote so everyone i talk to says youre top drawer with silk stockings insidewhatd you find kathy who signed as his sponsoring officer wickwire thomas dane see what you can find or rank but can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order dont say my name but are there i mean how many the woman i saw you with i dont know if theres any single reason but my father was navy and he had this oldtime recruiting poster in his den it showed a girl trying on a sailors uniform while saying gee i wish i were a man id join the navy was maybe 10 years old when i first saw it and even then it felt wrong made me mad and i dont think a month has gone by that i havent thought about that poster gee i wish i were a man whos we thats what i hear thank you ensign sir what did he say would you have the discretion to end it right then and there sir if tomorrow i was not under your command would the inquiry still go forward sir please if theres any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud im saying were just friends sir if someone is suggesting that im a lesbian theyre wrong permission to leave sir sir i want you to know that i had nothing to do with any of this not this article not see me sir so ill get a fair shot wouldnt dream of it sir across the board sir same rules for everyone sir the shape doesnt bother me its just that goddamn rotten stench no sir i think youve resented me from the start sir pardon i cant afford civility sir how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when youve got me set up as an outsider even if i make it under these rules i still lose because therell always be a flag in my file yeah she made it but i mean really why didnt you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base its this doublestandard the separate quarters the deferential treatment its how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met its you sir and it started the day i came here pardon the hour sir but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way sir i just want you to know im not here to make a statement i dont want to make men look foolish all i care about is completing the training and getting operational experience just like everyone else i suspect none at this time sir really i have no problem with barber was my next stop sir wouldve had it regulation sooner only thank you sir but i expect a certain amount of pain im fine sir thank you sir west newberry get a photo south fine by me sir ah cmon sir you know i wonder what the secnav would think about it if i spoke with him im sure it is you promise wickwire a fast ticket too i wanted the choice the chance to prove myself my skills my work me thats how it shouldve been so the rhetoric gets you headlines but the reality gets you in trouble you were never going to let women serve in combat you always had a safety net or thought you did what are you saying that a womens life is more valuable than a mans that a womens death hurts a family more you dont know that so isnt the president jumping on your bandwagon if i have to ask again senator ill be asking in front of cameras what changed did you set me up did you set me up just to see me fail it should you nominated him for specrecon just three days after you nominated me you know him lieutenant thomas wickwire uh maam cant complain maam would i be the only one the only woman uh question maam captain dwyer technically i know that sir maam its just that beggin your pardon senator but do you understand that this involves combat training coronado thank you maam um may i ask what this is regarding spotted you chief pri one is to slip you some air so were coming down with a tank just something until the ateam shows over flea cool cortez newman take your minis hit the water go go fuck basherbasher this is ground crew six requesting emergency extraction stand by for a prc fix hey you okay flea do that well flea i appreciate the respect

thank you sir but i like these just fine which is guyspeak for so here we are again staring three years of operational duty in the face yeah me too you dont crap out of specrecon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country hes got a sea daddy somewhere wickwire said he was drydocked in washington between stints at coronado in washington i dont know i dont care sounds like an amazing coincidence instructors typically pull three year assignments this guys in and out in one year your year that sound right what about him im tired of fighting back i just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world okay its done with royce let it go no shortage of suspects maybe though it didnt seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it almost like did i say he was class officer all i wanted was an honest chance and if i couldnt get it i couldnt stay sure ill join the crowd still cant make up your mind huh got ta go royce well let me warm you im going though with this the more everybody fucks with me fucks with my head the more it just makes me want to finish so dont expect me back crying in your arms any time soon okay you know royce i got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets too so why are you telling me this i saw an article me why me i feel like theres men here theres women here then theres men but hey whatd i expect its hard to find time to sleep royce much less keep up with my phone life thank you royce it was shaping up like such a tough call and then you go and make it so goddamn easy really thank you so much you know right up until you said that i thought i did know which is guyspeak for wai wait what happens if it works four months of training three years of operational duty what then sorry but after our days so if i try this thing if i ship out to coronado what happens here get your dick back here it has everything to do with you this has nothing to do with you you need operational duty to really advance you need combat training to go operational yet combat training is offlimits to people with tits im topped out at intel forget the glass ceiling im

jail when did you decide why youre avoiding the question you know where it came from its not like its anybodys life savings it wouldnt even be missed no i mean you right now not it you were somebody else what about you max he tries to act cool he werent bullshittin either cause later he was suspended and forced to retire not really but i knew this narcotics cop one time told me that in a raid the whole package never gets back to the station his exact words you dont propose something like that unless youre pretty sure the other persons into it hes setting me up to make a proposition maybe but im thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself i know i got your message ray wanted to have dinner he wanted to talk about the sting were plotting thats what he calls it a sting hes being real nice to me yeah we were goin over everything thats why all the bags im helping him bring his money into america he loves the idea you just missed him right around here in the food court he always just picked it up at my place but with atf involved i want to stage it you know make it look more intriguing like we know what the fuck were doin then its up to ray nicolet the atf guy to follow the shopping bag yea but im going to dress it up put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone i meet here they seem to like the idea i go back to work tomorrow how olds annette why yeah shes the girl who drove the bus in speed shes cute who was your girl before annette and annettes it for you does it happen to all men oh are you does she know that how was it whatd ya see i know ignoring me whatre you up to surprise well ive flown seven million miles and ive been waitin on people almost twenty years the best job i could get after my bust was cabo air which is about the worst job you can get in this industry i make about sixteen thousand with retirement benefits aint worth a damn and now with this arrest hanging over my head im scared if i lose my job i got ta start all over again but i got nothin to start over with ill be stuck with whatever i can get and that scares me more than ordell i just feel like im always starting over you said how many bonds you wrote yeah my ass aint the same its different with men howd you feel about it really im asking how you feel does it bother you how do you feel about getting old i aint goin to jail and i aint doin that probation thing again if i get let off otherwise fuck em same way i been doin but first they got to let me go back to work he needs me without me all that money is just gon na sit over there in cabo sugar he had his doubts at first but hes always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can we talked he came by he told me last night its a lot of money about a halfa million dollars all of it in cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in i want to talk to them first i know more now about ordells money i dont know yet im going to talk with dargus and nicolet today do what you suggested offer to help and see what happens i called in sick this morning as far as the airline knows im still available 74 i think the delfonics uhhuh i got a few but i cant afford to start all over again i got too much time and money invested in my records i couldnt wait till i got home last night and wash my hair want to hear some music yeah what i couldnt hear you thanks but i have my own now i felt a lot safer having it my milk went bad when i was in jail i am have a seat i think maybe i have more options than i thought but if all i can give em is ordells name i dont really know shit about what he does or how he does it that dont give me much to bargain with yeah if i cooperate whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened this aint solvin my problem i got ta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble im off today but if i cant leave the country im out of a job and if i dont got a job i cant hire a lawyer thats it hes cash poor he kept on me till i finally said okay ill bring whatever fits in a nineby twelve envelope i got paid five hundred dollars and his friend mr walker in mexico gave me the envelope its all in lock boxes in a mexico bank but hes got a problem hes what do you call it when you got money but dont have cash with ten thousand nine i used to bring over ten thousand at a time thats the legal limit so i never brought more than that i have a pretty good idea ordell aint no bootlegger and i doubt hes smugglin cuban cigars so that only leaves one thing an atf man would be interested in it was the other guy who busted me ray nicolet with alcohol tobacco and firearms i didnt the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont ordell pick up his bond thats him how do you know em who gave me the money and who i was giving it to and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off said it was him who told them bout me i had em too i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down then their asses lucked out and found that coke yeah but thats not what this was about they were fuckin waitin for my ass they knew i had that money they even knew the amount the one who searched my bag from lapd dargus hardly even looked at it oh id say theres fifty thousand here what would you say but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs and i could tell they didnt want to do that sure shit so far ive been told i can cooperate and get probation maybe or i can stand mute and get as much as five years does that sound right youre not tired of it she was more helpful than the fuckin public defender i dont know i guess what i need is a lawyer find out what my options are davidoffs i get em in mexico theyre hard to find here i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin her boyfriends head open with a baseball bat thats why i dont quit if i cant fly anymore im gon na have a bitch of a time gettin my brand you gain weight cause i look like i just got outta jail thats why you droppin me off at home right theres a place by me that doesnt sound dark is it dark id love one but not there couldnt we just stop at a seven eleven i dont think so can we stop for cigarettes who put up my bond ordell can i see your id are you really a bail bondsman okay if i dont cooperate what if i plead guilty whos side are you on you tell those guys theyll have to do one helluva lot better than that before ill even say hi to them well sheronda it was nice talking to you you know whats in the bag youre taking then you dont see him for a few days not every day do you live together do you think i took some of that money what about me so what happens now i thought you were watching him if itll make you happy i have no idea i didnt see him i was in my underwear if it was a white guy it was probably louis he kill melanie not in the fitting room i went looking for you i went straight to the bookstore cause thats where you were last time but you werent there how the hell else am i supposed to let anybody know what happened you didnt tell me how to do that did you i knew i was under surveillance so when i couldnt spot anybody i started yelling i had to i was frantic i didnt know what to do she didnt give me one i told you before melanie wasnt part of the plan ordell must of told her to do it she bursts in grabs the shopping bag and takes off what am i supposed to do go after her im in my fucking underwear i had to get dressed before i could do anything so i put this back on cause could put this on faster than i could my uniform because i didnt have it ray i swear melanie came in and grabbed it and someone killed her for it i got there early ive had my eye on this suit wait lets start over i got there early the idea was to try on the suit see if i liked it if i did get them to wrap it up and change back into my uniform thats what sherondas expecting me to wear go meet sheronda give her the bag with fifty thousand and go home i thought i did si how can i do anything if im being watched every second that would be one point of view yes all those things are true uhhuh ever been tempted i never have its not my money i was told ten thousand in each pack we could if im not in jail you said that the last time right everythings the same except one change uhhuh she didnt say uhhuh i smiled and walked away she also told me ordell killed beaumont im sure that was the idea it was her coke i got busted with she knows everything but shes not part of it and shes pissed cause shes not part of it ordell wouldnt even let her stay at the meeting she tried to talk me into ripping off ordell white girl named melanie ralston another girlfriend of ordells not yet i imagine shit needs to be done what for not really this afternoon before i came here he was with ordell at an apartment in hermosa beach i dont know if he lives there but i can find out ordell has a white guy working for him named louis a broadway shopping bag i thought you were going to let this one through what are you doing short of wearing a wire ill do everything i can to help you throw his ass in jail and in exchange for my help i need permission to leave the country and immunity he told me besides why else would an atf man be after him no he sells guns you never asked me if i did or not if im working i can help you i need it tomorrow if i dont show up for work tomorrow im fired i need permission to leave the country so i keep my job can i smoke look that shit aint mine you planted that shit on me what the fuck is that shit yeah now be careful with that bag you dont want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store i put a little cherry on top youre right what the hell he ever do for us do you got something for me yeah do you like it hi melanie i dont think so but thanks for the beer keep it between us girls dreaming kinda beaumont livingston he said he didnt know about it that coke was yours wasnt it what were you two fighting about how long you been with ordell uhuh killians sure well i guess i better look for another one then thanks anyway im waiting for the phone oh hi he wont know where the money came from only that its money give it to the bail bondsman max cherry hell take care of it and a hundred thousand if i go to jail if i wasnt this wouldnt work now once i deliver ill have to trust you ray the atf guy where you gon na be during all this the fitting room theres a sign over the door designer clothes right the one simone gives me simone and ill make the switch at robinsonsmay she knows what i look like what does she think shes gettin are you sure she dont know about the money it washes off i tell them were doing it the same way as before theyll follow sheronda i hate the idea of leaving her for a fall nicolet and dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills not when its my ass on the line you dont we do this my way or fuck it i know but i hung around cause i figured youd try an pull some shit like this i was there i saw her do it sheronda passin the money onto someone else thats what the hell im talkin bout i dont want no more fuckin surprises we do this the way i laid it out or we dont do it at all i need to talk to you alone look its my ass facin the penitentiary you send some hard headed roc whore and she fucks things up who the moneys in a broadway shopping

manager im managing to get your money out of mexico into america in your hands and im managing to do all this under the nose of the cops that makes me your manager and managers get fifteen percent well its my plan were in this together i was thinkin the del amo mall in the food court can you cover that thats the idea no i give it to someone else first the next trip when i come with all the money itll look like i hand it to the same one i did before if you want i dont know one of your friends if you just listen youll see its a damn good idea the first time i do it theyre lurking about they see me hand the ten thousand to someone you dont have to i told em youre real careful you never pick up money yourself you always send someone and i never know who it is i make two deliveries the first one with ten thousand like a dry run they watch it see how it works then we do a second delivery when i bring in the half mill they know im delivering for you i mention the halfmillion they dont

octogenarians were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica california can you prove any of this the space shuttles seismic secret the oliver stonegeorge bush connection oliver stone are these yours equitation this would be it um coffee if thats okay surprise me you okay believe you about what youre certifiable what newsletter so why are they after you thats it do they have a secret handshake what is it with you and the space program nothing scary there sorry you have the right to ask me certain personal questions till today i havent believed a word now im curious six months eleven days im going to give you one more hour to impress me where to how long have we known each other jerry see wasnt that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans thats how a man would do it im not a man you mean i should speed up and try and lose them as opposed to yeah them who right sit up so i can see you oswald was an assassin youre not an assassin are you jerry thats how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out a lot of people are after you jerry dont tell me youre naked back there i cant promise you anything he says a dog bit his nose heart attacks happen for what i got to get downstairs the cia they want to see your body you

weapon i dont see the connection its okay im game i dont understand you sound so sure not a man ezekiel walters it was my fathers kept it in his wallet he was murdered whered you get it if this was a spy novel your next words would be something like i now know too much to live why are you telling me all this i dont believe you im still listening these things youre talking about you did them to jerry a dog jerry told me he bit your nose missionary penance you talk about it like it was a religion if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it id arrest you right here terminal as in catcher in the rye ask what you can do for your country that kind of thing it was mind control manchurian candidate kind of stuff right truthll set you free im listening fine what the hell is going

year ago i was leaving work late one night two guys tried to mug me it was horrible jerry came out of nowhere to my rescue then he started coming to see me couldve been a storybook if he wasnt crazy at first i did my beat to avoid him but theres something inside jerry and jerry made me see it he made me see him that make sense excuse me honestly i think he has a crush on me im sorry what was the question again youve asked me that one three times you already asked me that why do you insist on making me repeat myself and you feel bad for it excuse me can i ask you something what do i look like to you switzerland too bad because im terrible at yes look youre a nice guy but im not really dating right now working working agent lowry then this is a goddamn emergency do you have an agent lowry in your new york office i need to speak with an agent lowry go to the northeast corner call a cab bring the pizza then theres a poem roses are red violets are blue if the pope goes to washington i would too understood we dont know who jonas is we dont know who it is were cooperating with i dont like it somethings wrong this doesnt make sense tell him im on vacation that i wont be back for two weeks not today i dont think so what do you suggest im going to find him because hed find me where do you think jerry is hes shown himself why havent you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do and jonas nothing i was just making sure so who are you whos the deputy director of the fbi i want to believe you too do you believe me can i talk to you a second when im ready to compare notes ill let you know jonas agent lowry no not yet i was just thinking that i dont know didnt see him you dont understand wait tell me about iti dont know ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology is it possible yes sir yes sir thank you what would you have me say david good luck david this seemed best maybe they are maybe this is all part of the package the building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale maybe requiring us to come together in this way was in effect part of the plan i cant believe they wouldnt take something as basic as our biological needs into account you what im asking for your help david i want to go theyll need someone relatively young unattached and probably a scientist as the presidents science advisor you have enormous weight im asking if youll support my candidacy david i know weve had our differences but ive always thought of you as a fair man even when weve disagreed and its in that light im hoping youll consider my request itll just take a moment do you have a minute david you mean what is it whats happened ms president this is communist paranoia right out of war of the worlds there is no reason whatsoever to believe the etis intentions are hostile we pose no threat to them it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in africa are you threatening me im going to convert mr scienceis therootofallevil this is absurd david we have work to do here i dont have time to play babysitter to the god squad with me what why rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise could it be a nested code of some sort its hardly yesterday the signals been traveling for over twentysix years as for why im hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out to see if theres another message buried deeper in the signal mathematics is the only truly universal language senator we think this may be a beacon an announcement to get our attention david goddamnit they are out there david the difference being what that i refuse to adopt the standard line that i dont care about the results of my work well i do care of course any discovery has to be verifiable of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method but i refuse to go around pretending im some kind of dispassionate automaton when its obvious to anyone with a brain im just not im searching for patterns in the noise thats all order in the chaos im practicing listening meaning you cant just pull the plug david its not enough having my search time systematically cut down you know im down to three hours a week now did i tell you weve expanded the search spectrum were including several other possible magic frequencies not just the hydrogen line anymore i was trying to get inside their heads yknow and i started thinking what other constants are there in the universe besides hydrogen and then suddenly it was so obvious transcendantals right so weve been trying variations of pi no doubt presidents science advisor so what you just spend all your time jetting around on air force one now really congratulations by the way oh hows he doing pepsi tequila then disagree but dont stand in my way what if youre wrong no ill grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence you cant deny the possibility and i believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly profound is worth investigation and worth taking a few risks youre dr drumlin we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity there are over four hundred billion stars out there im willing to take that risk well yes of course all im saying is this message was written in the language of science mathematics and was clearly intended to be received by scientists if it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush or a booming voice from the sky and while its function remains for the moment a mystery my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind because you cut it from the budget three years running it could be anything the first volume of some encyclopedia galactica how can that be and what maybe itll be at the end of the data when the message recycles a third layer what dr lunacharsky hows the spying tonight guys i scanned it at arecibo negative results always put it on speakers im not sure you mind checking right ascension 18 hours 34 minutes declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes vb10s an m dwarf signa draconis too old j39 z186 i think we just hit the cosmic jackpot its a civilian facility okay lets just slow down pull up the starfield signal origin thank you mr sensitive im coming at this wrong missing something something its beautiful this is how you see the sky nice where ellie pulsar dr cullers because i cant but i dont believe it to be the truth is it possible yes but by our standards yes i dont have the figures in front of me but yes that sounds about right there is no direct evidence no i dont have an official response michael all i have are the same questions you have i dont understand it all i can think is that maybe because the video gear wasnt accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design thats terrific but theres one problem we dont have the means to receive all the data on our own pardon me but you cant do and a hundred mile airspace which well also need the networks help to receive and decode you want to classify prime numbers this isnt a person to person call mr kitz i dont really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for americans no please please if you downloaded everything about us you know the problems we face the impact it could have it could make the difference but you said you wanted to help dont you see what it would mean but other people from our planet should see what ive seen they should witness this for themselves none taken but do we get to come back others of my kind i mean no i mean why so soon so what happens now all those voices you gather them all together millions of intelligences in one consciousness and now were a part of it the librarian or the library can you help us so we passed some kind of test the scale its just so all the civilizations you detect they all end up coming here so who and they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built and those other docking ports i saw i mean there are others why did you contact us can you show me so who what are you but youre so i mean how could you possibly when i was unconscious you downloaded my thoughts my memories even this beach ive never been here but i remember its how i always imagined pensacola so are you an hallucination or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin youre not real none of this is dad but tell me how did i mean how can i used i used to dream you were alive and then id wake up and lose you all over again okay pensacola okay okay there could we hear god could we hear to the moon could we hear to china but what do i say i cant move any smaller why dont you come back with me of hadden industries the systems integration site the gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us you sound like joseph you think the world ends with the millennium what are you talking about its over it looks like pixie dust kent wouldve given anything to see this david too whats that its so small mr hadden im a scientist i dont make deals but if you wish to give me in good faith access to your information i can assure you that i will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesnt conflict with the best interests of science or my better judgment and in return a machine but a machine that does what some kind of circuitry youre saying there is no separate primer in the message because its on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is a pagebreak signal a period if i knew you any better id say that doesnt sound like you youve found it what could i possibly have that you would want mr hadden i didnt realize i was out what kind of deal why am i here mr hadden you live here sr hadden you compromised our security codes youre implying that the whole selection process is a sham i thought you were here because you want to go id say this is slightly different weve just lived through a century of incredible violence and self destruction do you call it interventionist when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck but the machine worked thats what ive been trying to tell everyone the tape its all there if theyd just look at the tape peter what is going on has everyone gone completely insane how long was i gone peter what are you talking about what malfunction what day is this wait hold on a minute im im fine like it almost there that you valerian someone tell me this is really happening you too peter you sonofabitch im serious about this peter right now well drive down to ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us and you think i dont want those things you think i dont stay up half the night wondering if ive made the right choice living half a world away from you wondering if any of this is worth what im giving up for it everyday lets get married please youre just as ambitious as i am more but the work but what about your research greenbank we could be together again peter if you can get him to do that for me hed obviously do the same for you we could the vla its almost there the hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time if we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldnt even have the option of failing wed have to wonder our whole lives unable to do anything about it this time right now is unique in our history in any civilizations history the moment of the acquisition of technology the moment when contact becomes possible weve already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now weve been going after some of the big multinationals but without much luck got a donation from a new york dowager weve even been thinking about selling tshirts ive examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing still weve barely started please any chance of that died the day david drumlin was appointed head of the nsf i have been in contact with a few other seti people weve been trying to find backing from private investors ive even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there i keep telling myself okay thats just the price you have to do your time doing shitwork before youre allowed to get to the good stuff but if i have to catalog one more quasar god ive missed you is indistinguishable from magic its like the precopernicans who swore the sun revolved around the earth or the victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made i mean try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us then imagine trying to explain i dunno a microwave oven to someone even a hundred years ago i mean the basic concepts didnt exist im just so sick of feeling defensive about the things i care about or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like drumlin when if theyd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts what a coincidence it happens to be my fetish too i read your paper on etis its brilliant sounds like a russian general ellie arroway hes an incredible prick but i never learned so much in my life drumlin said youre been down at arecibo for the last year something my dad they said after all the suffering after all the desolation of the void the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other the one thing that makes it bearable is love im not sure maybe it simply exists in the search for it maybe its something we have to make for ourselves i dont know if it was a god it was searching for a greater one it was still searching for meaning in other words god works in mysterious ways but it is a good question and i suppose ill always wonder about the answer why would they send me back without proof i want to palmer more than anything but it has to be real it has to be true but its not enough dont you understand i know it happened but by every standard of science by every standard ive lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point it may be true but it doesnt matter because i cant prove its real i dont have any proof palmer youre sure you want to in the universe i saw were not exactly the stars of the show what happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small they dont believe me so im assuming they sent you here to administer last rites pretty ironic huh i had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy just to find you im assuming you read my deposition hi and yet thats always how i seem to end up isnt it if you really do love me palmer youll leave now please i cant hear this now i dont know dont you understand i just have to hold it together just until tomorrow please please palmer if you care for me at all dont push this now i cant do this im sorry i cant im sorry i do seem to be maybe because im just a little bit terrified about tomorrow thank you the final countdown i remember you were indelicate indiscreet and entirely less than tactful sound like anyone you know how do you mean another question i would ask would be a very simple one how did you do it how did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves its late we should go back its getting late i dont know but as a scientist i have to consider that possibility maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isnt because science has obscured it maybe its just revealed it isnt there did you ever stop to think that maybe that isnt sciences fault but meanings i thought it was wellwritten heartfelt and a little bit naive but thats just the enemys perspective im more interested in the story behind the story how a young man goes from living on the streets of south boston to being the best selling media figure rubbing elbows with the president losing faith the search for meaning in the age of reason catchy i read your book its what my whole lifes been aimed at the only thing thats given it a sense of purpose if you came back if you survived at all which its pretty certain you wouldnt something like that if you came back in other words its too elegant the degree of economy is extraordinary its really the next logical step even on earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature dna outclasses any computer we can come up with the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable i dont think so not exactly it has organic qualities but we dont really understand how theyre integrated with the mechanical systems i was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors so is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this yes very much i never knew my mother my father died when i was nine you may not believe this but theres a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your god to believe that were all here for a purpose that all this means something but its because that part of me wants it so badly that im so stubborn about making sure it isnt just selfdelusion of course i want to know god if there is one but it has to be real unless i have proof how can i be sure and theres no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it can you try thats not doubt thats four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct i always wondered what you religious types did with your free time i flinched and mind yes what are you thats not faith its physics the second law of thermodynamics very smooth its palmer right where i came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards really though the bible describes a god who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old i look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies each with hundreds of billions of stars i mean burn me for a heretic but your god seems awfully small well its been a while but i dont recall the bible saying too much about alien civilizations what about you doesnt all of this shake your faith at all i guess i wouldve felt sorry for the universe id say logic more than faith the odds were on my side champagne please and where exactly does that put your position for managing the truth but the truth wont be managed sir it stops being the truth the moment you try i guess id say i trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of thanks for the advice but no thanks but to dilute or censor the truth for whatever reason you kill me you really do the first truly global apolitical event in history and you cant wait to spin it yknow what fine i guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are theres no quicker way to show them call it xenophobic paranoia dont you see the absolute absurdity of this this isnt about them its about us our violence our fear and mistrust i question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed basically announcing our intentions are hostilein the morning we talked come in out of the rain bud hes the opposite of you hes more like me cold calculating come in out of the rain in the morning well have both our stories for breakfast you found patchett you found me youre smart

coming id have baked a cake actually buds only tough on the outside like recognizes like im pretty tough myself youre tougher than bud thinks you are because youll use it against me wont you no this is the means to the reality but im not going to tell you what it is i came out here with a dream thats gone but i settled for reality you dont like that you dont know how to play him he doesnt follow the same rules of politics you do that makes him dangerous does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier i see bud because he makes me feel like lynn bracken and not some veronica lake lookalike who fucks for money i see him because he doesnt know how to disguise who he is theres more if you want to hear it i see bud because i want to i see bud because he cant hide the warmth he has inside him you want to know what buds like in bed the silver screens loss is your gain oh the best i ever had absolutely the best the way youve underestimated bud white it galls you that i know so

late enough it is a disgusting habit bertie it should be discouraged i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box least of all my son it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave cold is good is that not so dr jenner no dinners bertie why are you dressed for outdoors gesture yes yes it was you should never have gone out in such foul weather then why send me back to them i will not hear any more about my safety you made me a promise and now you have broken it you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most you stand there and tell me it is my duty after all you promised me i can not believe you are saying this you who i have relied on all this time duty you talk about duty the queen forbids it i can not allow it because i can not live without you without you i can not find the strength to be who i must be please i do not accept yes has someone seen to those bruises i was told you were in a fight john the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated im sure am i not safe enough with you john dear me youll be telling me to watch what i eat next must they always follow us what is it john john to keep out the cold i hope they didnt go to any trouble john what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson of course i shall say what i have to say i always do i do not do it for others but ponsonby thinks they are good his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing not its subject he has been attending at balmoral for many years sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming i am told so i am thinking of publishing my highland journals craobhangeanmchno how can i possibly say that with a straight face those over there there what are those yes it is a fine spot for a bench is it not sir henry is not alone they all wish it the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank he thought so yes prince albert was going to build a bench here he thought it one of the best views in osborne the queen will ride out if and when she chooses then why do you persist in doing it you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so mr brown yes that will be company for you yes you have a brother in service here do you not i forget his name my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you he would have approved i am sure of my calling on you in this way i trust it does not inconvenience you too much your family sent cards it was much appreciated and the pony you are well you are here safely mr brown i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral this is my good john brown i stay here because i am happy is that such a terrible crime i never thought to be bullied by you mr disraeli you i thought understood a widows grief is that not enough then they may read about me but i lack your prose mr disraeli how ill is he why was i not informed no you are mistaken prince albert my husband had typhoid fever i asked what was wrong with my son i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy why am i being lectured in this way cold is good whom why was i not told earlier how long has he been this sick has he been hurt unwell why well i made no request to go out riding today how long has he been there what is he doing there just them please tell the princess and other signatories to this letter that the queen will not be dictated to or made to alter in any way what she has found to answer for her comfort do i make myself clear what do they want my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person from whom what is it is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors i am not a fool i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends sometimes i feel that brown is all i have left of albert and now they attack brown too noone should think themselves wiser than me it is not for any of the queens subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning it is the queens sorrow that keeps her secluded it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely why not who told them that read it read it and now i am back we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant it was most agreeable no i shall be out walking why please make sure it does not happen again sir henry mr brown is standing in the courtyard i have no wish to go riding what is the matter with him then why are you not with him

northern fucking hemisphere is all im s dont you have to be somewh thats why michael and i were the wrong fit right from the start what else did he tell you i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same

important stuff kims ring ill collect the inconsequentials then it could all come out sooner or later nobody should be in on this just you and me or more correctly i hes too proud to beg for help and if you wait till this comes out your offer will be like charity completely humiliating hes said some things over the past few weeks look this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job i think hes been fired its a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson michaels boss sir this is important havent you ever in your life cut one corner to make something important turn out right is anybody watching i think youre making a mistake sir nice meeting you too walt i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question me yeah and she likes tommy lasorda case closed okay

craziest dream last night walter and kimmy had asked your boss to if san antonio sweeps sacramento should we take a walk or maybe some food sent up or something maybe tomorrow youll feel dif michael a bad combination what happened maybe you should take the job and dump the girl mike the funny thing is hes offering you a gig youd be stupid to turn down michael what ha maybe its congratulations it means a lot youre right easy come easy go we could use his computer to just email those suckers right ou its just up there right in front of walters yknow computer if memory serves thats my point im up against a deadline isnt there a guard a janitor a fucking cleaning woman ill take a burglar somebodys got ta be in th yes no accents today well we danced to it just like this the night we met ill

memories to choose from have you if you like you miss her huh well youve got the rest of your lives you keep saying that like i said dazzling michael it sounds like a wonderful opportun michael never can tell you need a babysitter thats what im here for boy those were the days i switched that around when you werent looking i never eat when im serene still alls fair in love and w i guess youre right that would be deceitful manipulative controlling emascula i mean walter owns the sox cable sports most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t all of it shes leaving her family her friends everything she knows shes putting her career on hold and she seems a pretty ambitious driven kind of pers pretty amazing girl youve got make that kind of sacrifice should i whistle down a cab the vespa me hanging on behind in the rain all night where was that florence huh gim me like eight and nine off the top ten list can that kind of defect be passed on genetically waiter check please is there a coup de grace in here somewh quite the little eccentric endearingly absentminded whats next hate that such as i just admire your maturity thats all i mean there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring day after day year after year best everything joe but im going to dance with you whats the sec w well maybe we should talk ab thomas yeh michael its wednesday night you cant possibly be getting married on su youve met her parents well sure well somet well thats great you havent really had anybody since dingbat jennylee yeh well my old machine kept eating messages i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement but finallythats entirely understandable why dont you just drive a stake through my heart i love him that this is all my fault dont you see this must be very very hard on him look at all this beautiful food so lovingly prepared we settled this and i reneged that wasnt fair i just dont want to freak him out he wont get mad huh hell see right through it exactly what so one almost has to gold dog collars they dont have dogs for the twins what in the world is th but he always says i mean he loves his job i just think youre wrong is all about michaels job stop were embarrassing h its not just clubs this guy always knows the best everything the best guitar store the best beef ribs the best horowitz record was he always like the ju he has you on a pedestal and me in his arms youre enshrined in his heart and memory unassailable which works out great you win and the answer was so simple im not joking i had to face up to all my competitive drives and believe me ive got em youll always be there in his mind the perfect creature he loved for all those y except one but nothing ever could ever did give me a moments pause about this marriage so its sweet of you to be protective and loving him means loving all of this after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults i made a command decision that changed my life but he sure can kiss he sucks soup through his front teeth cigars in bed i broke him on that but the bathrooms a swamp he wears reeboks to dinner tells the same admittedly funny jokes three hundred times his snoring yeah he says its worse than ever that snaffle one it depends if san antonio sweeps sacramento we could start there or phoenix or depending on indiana clevel im excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot hes only there a ye what because im a little understand just my bridal shower and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a onethirty game he said that too you hate weddings you never go not you you wont be comfortable unless youre distinctive the twin part i like to remain impartial in my contempt the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty identical twin debutantes from nashville who are basically vengeful sluts with amazing bodies you cant believe what itd cost to bring in a temp this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav see dry its in the delivery but i cant be dry i can be quick i can even be funny my hearts in my throat here right off i have to ask this monstrous favor i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you all ive heard from the day i met michael is julianne this and julianne that michael well if thats the way you f what is that sup all of a sudden im supposed to drop out of school forget my family forget my career forget all the plans i had for my life and to m it would only be maybe six months or three or four it would mean so much to him he needs someone incredible someone really close who he can trust and public relations is a big problem area for him no its uh a real big favor to the twins soiree so they can paw you and drool the most important thing is being together well the school will be here architecture will still be around right nowenter cotton weary finish what my son started where do you think he got it mental illness is heriditary

back so they could wave to each other it comforted him those are all from the fair last year abbott and me were judges at the pet show oh yes like i said they always came out together to see him off to school its like he was their little treasure he was such a beautiful boy thats a picture of him on the wall there behind abbott no nothing like that the ottos are what id call model citizens theyre regular at town meetings they give their opinions in a respectful way they always help out at various fundraising bazaars in town though they arent church goers i mean the way they look their hair and clothing about the ottos dolores no one calls me mrs driscoll the ottos always waited for the bus with bear they were the only parents who did that together like that i guess theyre what you might

wanted to them to be punished thats right what mason okay dont you usually like to sit at the back to wave at your dad yes rats they fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles and ate the cheeses out of vats and licked the soup from the cooks own ladles split open the kegs of salted sprats made nests inside mens sunday hats and even spoiled the womens chats by drowning their speaking with shrieking and squeaking in fifty different sharps and flats its like a song the pied piper of hamelin by famous hanover city the river weser deep and wide washes its wall on the southern side a pleasanter spot you never spied but when begins my ditty it was snowing why dolores you seem very sure about that the truth is that it was an accident and no ones to blame i wont lie what do you want me to do for you mr stephens yes like bear and the ansel twins and sean and you can only feel lucky that you didnt die for so long then you start to feelunlucky i dont like thinking about the accident i dont even remember it happening besides it just makes people feel sorry for me and i remember the bus swerved it just suddenly swerved to the right and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road and then it went over the embankment there and everyone was screaming and everything and thats all i guess i was unconscious after that thats all then i was in the hospital yes i do now now that im telling it no because the bus went off the road and crashed i was scared and there wasnt time no yes i told you i was positive the speedometer was large and easy to see from where i was positive seventytwo miles an hour yes i looked i remember clearly now it seemed we were going too fast down the hill i was scared the speedometer and it was downhill there dolores was driving too fast yes i understand i was scared before the actual accident yes there was a brown dog that ran across the road up there right by the dump and dolores slowed down not to hit him and he ran into the woods and then dolores drove on and turned onto the marlowe road as usual i remember that im remembering it pretty clearly yes as im talking im remembering more about it yes no until the accident no yes there was my usual place on the right side the first seat yes like what i mean i dont remember a lot no i was alone my sister jenny was sick and stayed home that day about eightthirty in the morning yes someplace where no one knows her someplace strange and new shell move away will the police do anything to her whats going to happen to dolores how about

one of lydias dresses that she was wearing it when the bus crashed because i have to i have to or that the guardrail wasnt strong enough mr stephens says that someone didnt put a right bolt in the bus

the oven have a nice daydr frock we will no dr frock you cant that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes none of that matters now the people upstairs need us we have to help whats that dr frock did you hear that i think so whats going on and its hungry its been two days since its eaten there are five hundred people arriving right now the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell all those people in one enclosed space with the intelligence of a human being the speed of a greyhound and the strength of a grizzly bear nocturnal external hair and bony plates locomotor speed 6070 kilometers reduced optic chiasm poor eyesight external mucoid nasal glands very keen scent morphological characteristics highly robust aggressiveness extreme all right assuming the program is accurate this is a description of the animal with that claw species unidentified genus unidentified phylum unknown male weight in excess of 240 kg brain capacity 900 centimeters that means its highly intelligent quadrupedal but a virus normally codes for other viruses this ones making human and animal proteins listen to this glycotetraglycine collagenoid weinsteins tropic hormone 4 monoxytocin supressin hormone look at this an ambyloid reovirus protein that explains why the computers confused the plants infected with a virus several problems with that theory for one thing this egg is intact for another according to pendergast the crates were shipped here on a boat everyone on board was killed like beauregard if the thing hatched in midocean where did it go lets not jump to conclusions this egg could belong to any number of reptiles dr frock what are they whatever it is it must be common on the tepui john used it as packing material what is it a blow dart seed pods a plant press pretty unimpressive stuff that cuthbert what a piece of work someones dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit you are this museum it wont be the same without you im not giving up your work is highly relevant what about your display on primitive pharmacology cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you how can you say that you know its not true let me help i can take care of everything we cant do without you youre one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology youre practically an institution around here i dont believe it fourth floor west wing but stay with your class evolutionary biologist i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years im an evolutionary biologist what do you do yes i do okay how about lunch yes hes fine greg take care of yourself yes whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant when the crates were put in secure storage they were out of reach the killer couldnt get them so it got the next best thing pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victims brains this is it this is what he or it is after the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain try weinsteins tropic hormone what kind of hormones its reptilian theres another possibility a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage turkish gecko i believe a lizard its not mammalian thats for sure i think its reptilian mbwun for once im glad youre rumor central what in the world is going on thats impossible what i have the species identification on these teeth we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program call dr frock he wanted a demonstration but at what a price im so glad to see you whats the occasion i cant do it quickly please aim for the eye just like john he wont listen you have to listen all viruses pass on their own dna instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses this one was different it inserted a whole array of genes into john reptile genes sixty five million years old those genes remade him its not his fault that thing is john whittlesley i should have seen it before the fibers are infected with a virus you eat them and the virus alters your dna he became addicted to them in south america followed the plants back to the states he probably entered the country as a man it would have taken several months for the change to take place thats how he got from the boat to the museum no dont kill him pendergast you were right its john listen to me pendergast mbwuns dna is part homo sapien in primates the eye is a direct path to the brain if you get a clean shot theres only one place you can kill it shoot it in the eye you smell that help someone thats a ptarmigan feigning a broken wing the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest the answers right in front of us we have to try and draw it off i think for the pleasure of the kill no its still hunting but not for the hormones i think it means its full its eyesight is worse than i thought it couldnt see us and it couldnt smell us through the glass what is it doing what are you going to do is there another way around the planetarium unlock one of the other storage rooms were going upstairs well leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here we have the fibers dont you see the creature is hungry it wants the hormones in these plants it would take hundreds of human brains to supply whats in these fibers were just a poor substitute to make it stop hunting we have to give it what it wants its not supernatural mbwun is an animal part lizard part human a genetic freak of some kind like the halfgoat halfsheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam that would fit its nocturnal quick come inside wounded youre not where is it pendergast are you all right when dna is defective it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair viruses can damage dna so can radiation certain chemicals even cancer lets let the gse sort it out i have to get started this will take several hours i dont know mr pendergast do me a favor get me a dna readout on that claw all right this is hard for me im a scientist i like order and logic sometimes too much theres got to be an explanation there cant be an animal in there but i saw something i didnt imagine it i know what i saw are you sure there are enough men in there thats not what i saw behind me over there its okay im all right i remember now it was an animal something large i could smell it it was hunting me i saw two green eyes in the dark you were behind me running after me i dont know im not sure we should split up you take that hall and ill take this one i dont know he sent back a statue thats supposed to be an exact representation but ive never seen it its in the exhibit my god then it was an animal i dont understand no im all right i wont let this affect me anymore john wouldnt get help his ego endangered the lives of others his theory came first no one knows the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals yes he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect it held that evolution wasnt always gradual or driven by natural selection the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a monster species it made no sense but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years a legendary monster called mbwun he was afraid of himself he tried suicide once he was ill manic depressive he had wild emotional highs and lows not a happy affliction for a scientist hed been revered in our community by the end he was a joke that was two years ago john was still in love with me he wouldnt leave me alone how did you know that yes once we met at columbia john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there john couldnt have anything to do with a horrible thing like that he was a fine man despite his problems i dont understand and john if he were alive hed have contacted me somehow when all this happened i knew it would come back to john is he really dead with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal whether it was nocturnal what it ate how it hunted how big it was you arent here for a lesson in dna an invention of mine its a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna i call it the genetic sequence extrapolatorand to you mr andrews wont you even make a try for it mr andrews bottom left right i have it no ill do this with or without your help sir but without will take longer mr andrews thank god where would the master at arms take someone under arrest yes i understand thank you youre certain i saw the iceberg mr andrews and i see it in your eyes please tell me the truth mr andrews i did the sum in my head and with the number of
