more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on well you started it but thats a circular argument if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition they cancel each other out why why have you got to go round killing and looting what about the killing and looting thats just as crude isnt it you dont like it do you about raping me what dyou expect you come in here burn my village kill my family and try to rape me what oh get it over with what rape you dont love me its

left you never asked me and every time i brought it up youd get drowsy and fall asleep he didnt ditch me we had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it i have thats why i didnt call you first hello peter maybe we should discuss this somewhere else peter do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these

the house is beautifulgraham i want to touch you but why cant you just put it all behind you cant you just forget it all that stuff you did i want to know why you are the way you are youre not answering me why are you ashamed come on i dont care im just going to keep asking until you answer im sure theres plenty of tape because thats not good enough i asked you a question graham i asked you how does it feel how does it feel mr i want to go down on you but i cant do you know how many people youve sucked into your weird little world including me come on how does it feel why not yeah youre right but i never claimed to know everything like you and have all these little theories im still learning i know that but i dont feel like ive wasted time if i had to go through my marriage to get to where i am right now fine oh you just moved here to think about it right whoa im so glad we got that on tape you wont answer a question about elizabeth but i have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life graham what do you think shes going to make of all these videotapes are you going to tell her about them i cant imagine her being too understanding about that but since you dont lie anymore youll have to say something look at you look at whats happened to you look how youve changed dont you think she will have changed graham i mean what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her like maybe a big part but that was part of it wait a minute wait a minute whats going on here did you come back here just to see her again but youre planning to be you mean youre still in contact with her who elizabeth but how do you know for sure you have to try to find a way to fig but i dont understand why not im asking for real i want you to turn that camera off and make love with me will you so why wont you make love with me why wouldnt you i mean but i feel like maybe i could be really comfortable with you but if you were if you were in love with me would you youre really never going to make love again yeah i know but somehow i expect that from her i mean shell do it with almost anybody i dont know i shouldnt stick up for her i guess but him he lied so deeply ooo i want to watch him die god i m so mad at him im babbling kind of i mean johns like this kind of craftsman like hes a carpenter and he makes really good tables but thats all he can make and i dont need anymore tables subtlety yes no subtlety plus ive never really felt able to open up with anyone i mean that other person i told you about i enjoyed making love with him a lot but i still wasnt able to really let go i always feel like im being watched and i shouldnt embarrass myself i dont know it all gets back to that cynthia thing i dont like her eagerness theres nothing left to imagine theres no not yet im not sure i will i just want out i dont know anymore i thought i was but obviously i was wrong dont you get lonely and now you can how come so you lied to her what was the problem so what happened was it so bad that it turned you off who was the last person you had sex with so you have had sex you said you werent always impotent cant or wont why not on tape if i asked you to would you not on tape i mean i remember you could do that couldnt you go down on me have you fantasized about me yes i fantasized about you yes i know deep down i know that it just bothers me when i have feelings or impulses that she has because thats how cynthia thinks all she does is think about that stuff and i hate that i dont want to be like her i dont want to be like her yes whenever all right look whenever i see a man that i think is attractive i wonder what it would be like with him i mean im just curious i dont act on it but i hate that i think that i wish i could just forget about that stuff no i guess not yes i have i will i dont see what difference it makes i mean i can think what i want i dont know if i want to do this anymore im afraid i dont mind answering the questions so much but if somebody were to see this yes is he going to see this you dont know what im thinking sometimes afterward when were making love ann bishop millaney ann bishop millaney yes what will you do when the money runs out how do you pay for all this i mean rent and tapes and this equipment then do it what do you have to do to get ready what would you know about a normal frame of mind what difference does it make why i do it dont you want to make one why not why didnt you tell me how did you know you know john and cynthia have been fucking im not sure why i came here i had kind of decided not to talk to you after you know yes i do this is just so i dont why why do you do this to you and they just answer them you just ask them questions like what what about sex about sex what what are these interviews about why not can we look at one all of these are interviews you went out with her donna on this tape it says donna whos donna what kind of personal project i can see that what are they what are these somehow i imagined books i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished are you in the middle of something hi so since ive never had sex with you by your own advice i shouldnt accept your advice now you said never take advice from someone that you dont know intimately right excuse me for asking but how would you know of course not well my therapist knows me intimately so you dont believe in therapy arent you my therapist said that what why do you say im selfconscious well are you selfconscious about it does it bother you you are youre what as long as its not gross you know like some scar or something it has to be like mine like something about you so whats your personal thing are you really going to tell me something personal i dont know he just said he wants to wait i quit asking yeah actually i do but john doesnt at least not right now kids what about them yes yes i think thats very true very do you understand what im trying to say okay i think i think sex is overrated i think people place way too much importance on it and i think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap i m not saying women dont want it i just dont think they want it for the reason men think they do im getting confused can i tell you something personal i feel like i can its something i couldnt tell john or wouldnt anyway right right i dont feel connected to many people either other than john i feel like they do maybe youll understand this because you know john but he confuses me sometimes okay i will would you mind whats the first whos elizabeth younger mother father sister thank you thats hard to believe the two of you seem so different whyd you drop out why didnt you know him well nine years how long has it been since youve seen john you mean like time flies oh uhhuh oh definitely i mean just this past year has gone by like phew i hardly even knew it passed freelance you know well well the clichï½ about the security of it thats really true we own a house and i really like that you know and i like that john was just made junior partner so he has a steady job and hes not some oh i like it i like it very much you play an instrument no not really well no i think you look fine oh uhhuh graham is an unusual name no why television oh do you have other things we dont usually let people smoke in the house we have a patio if you oh well please sit down that was quick yes yes i have thought about it yes not very often he does yes yes im not going to discuss this with you anymore youre making no sense no but i wanted to i really wanted to partially just to piss you off i drove around then i went to talk with graham well call it uncontested or whatever i just want out i want out of this marriage i want out of this marriage i know i dont know sometimes i feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world i didnt say it was rational i just said i was convinced loud im sorry too i i get these ideas in my head you know and i have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios and then i want to believe it so i dont think ive wasted the whole day last week i was convinced you were having an affair with cynthia i dont know why youve made your point always the lawyer why dont i believe you but im not is that supposed to comfort me my sister for one is that who it is i cant tell you how upset i would be if you were lying if im right i want to know i dont want you to lie id be very upset but not as upset as if id found out youd been lying well are you are you having an affair whod you have lunch with thats interesting because i didnt leave a message did you see a message to call me when you got back in i called you tuesday at 330 and they said you werent in do you remember where you were john graham and i were talking about apartments and i told him to check the garden district there are some nice little places there garage apartments and stuff oh we get along okay shes just very shes an extrovert i think shes loud she probably wouldnt agree definitely wouldnt agree you did that i know but this i just feel like everybody i know right now is obsessed with sex because all she thinks about are these guys shes after and i just hate her shes such a little slut i thought that in high school and i think that now why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all whats the big damn deal i mean its okay and everything but i dont understand when people let it control them control their lives why do they do that i hate my sister but you dont have hidden motives for feeling that way right yes not really yes yes i guess what do you mean i dont understand that guy graham i told you about he said taking advice from someone you dont know intimately was well he said a lot of stuff ive been thinking about it for awhile and then i was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me i guess but not because of the way he looked or anything hes just so different somebody new to have a conversation with im just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not theyre going to buy the station wagon you know its just boring i dont know he was just different and hes really on about truth a lot being honest and i like that i felt comfortable around him after he left i had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room what do you mean like physically no he left last week oh graham no i didnt talk to him about that actually that turned out to be pretty interesting i expected graham to be this well like john you know i mean he said they had gone to school together so i was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff but he turned out to be this this kind of character i mean hes kind of arty but okay you know what visitor well the cumulative effect is not good let me tell you i knew i shouldnt have watered those plants yes its this radioactive gas in the ground and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up and youve never heard of this well i dont know the week started off okay but then i was outside watering the plants and i started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the greenhouse effect so i went inside and turned on the airconditioner full blast and that made me feel a little better until i started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor and well kind of recently i guess but not too recently well i kind of tried once it just seemed stupid i kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid and kind of uh i dont know and then i was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we dont know what to do with all that garbage you know god no what do you mean but see he stopped before i got that feeling thats why it seems weird to me i mean im sure he wishes i would initiate things once in awhile and i would except it never occurs to me im always thinking about something else and then the few times that i have felt like starting something i was by myself oh yeah but see ive never really been into sex that much i mean i like it and everything it just doest freak me out i wouldnt miss it you know but anyway lately we havent been doing anything at all like i said its not that i miss it but im curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden about a week ago i dont know what brought it on i just started feeling like i didnt want him to touch me fine i guess except right now im going through this where i dont want him to touch me yeah i know i guess im upset because i cant really justify being upset i mean its his house really he pays the mortgage no i dont know i havent told him about the garbage thing because im pissed off at him right now hes letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days and he didnt even ask me about it i mean i wouldve said yes i just wish he wouldve asked well do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are i mean maybe they do but i doubt those people are in therapy besides being happy isnt all that great my figure is always at its best when im depressed the last time i was really happy i put on twentyfive pounds i thought john was going to have a stroke yeah so what do you mean well this weekend john was taking out the garbage and he kept spilling things out of the container and i started imagining a container that grew garbage like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself and how could you stop that if it started happening dont you think thats a lot of garbage id really like to know where its all going to go nothing i mean nothing i try not to do anything that will produce garbage so obviously were talking about eating and basic stuff like that did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day bye i get real busy between two and four do you have my work number well i cant stay thirtytwo dollars i was just trying to it does not its a sun dress here it is i dont want to discuss it you are in serious trouble so hes got this catalogue of women touching themselves that doesnt make you feel weird that doesnt mean you do you cant possibly trust him hes perverted you know what i mean you dont even know him i mean i couldnt do that in front of john even i cant believe you did that you are in trouble you touched him did he touch you you dont know that for sure cynthia who knows where that tape may end up he could be bouncing it off some satellite or something some horny old men in south america or something could be watching it but why did you want to why did you do that cynthia did he ask you to take your clothes off oh so youll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape but you wont tell your own sister well like what did he ask exactly what kinds of questions i dont know i dont want to talk about it no hes not dangerous not physically no its nothing like that no because cynthia look john was right graham is strange very strange you dont want to get involved with him because i never got around to it no i didnt i dont he doesnt want you to come over i was thinking maybe i shouldnt be in therapy anymore fine i just thought it might dont you think she deserves a little more than a card i mean the woman gave birth to you its her fiftieth birthday a card for her fiftieth birthday are you getting mom something for her birthday lose something and do whatever it is you do i dont feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and let me talk to him first hes not getting a phone he doesnt like talking on the phone but he wont he doesnt have a phone i have a pretty good idea oh for gods sake really cynthia really i dont think hes your type well i wonder why well he doesnt strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing anyway you know what you say it just to irritate me do you have to say that why so you can go after him why not really maybe if i just saw him on the street id have said that but after talking to him hes just kind of i dont know unusual no not at all actually i dont think john likes him much anymore he said he thought graham had gotten strange i dont know he went to school here then he was in new york for awhile then philadelphia and then just kind of travelling around so will you someday it was busy i wish youd get an answering machine wait a minute do you mean dont tell me you in front of him did you take your clothes offbye okay no thank you so whats my share of the dress hold on it looks like a tablecloth what is it then why do you keep asking about it ann i dont understand why this freaks you out so much you didnt do it i did and if it doesnt bother me why should it bother you no i dont think they all did what i did hes harmless he just sits around and looks at these tapes whats the big deal i feel like i do you couldnt do it period why listen to you you sound like mom what are you talking about in front of him ann yes no but i did well its too late now isnt it he wouldnt do that i wanted him to see me because i wanted to what yes i did apparently well like i dont want to tell you exactly questions about sex he just asked me questions then whyd you call me well what then well what is he dangerous then whats the story whats this strange bullshit all of a sudden is he drowning puppies or what what the hell happened over there did he make a pass at you well why why not what do you mean he doesnt want me to come over did you tell him about me good now if youll pardon me i have to go to work okay ann okay how about this you buy her something nice and ill pay for half all right will you stop jesus whats wrong with that i dont know ill get her a card or something that goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune and what why just give me the address you wont even have to be involved oh please okay so give me the zen masters address ill think of a reason to stop by what are you talking about well ill call him when he does ann you dont have a clue look i dont even know why were discussing this ill just call him myself my type what is this bullshit how would you know what my type is i think youre afraid to put the two of us in the same room together i think youre afraid hell be undeniably drawn to me ann you always underestimate me i say it because its descriptive what besides even if i decided to fuck his brains out what business is that of yours jesus ann get a life i just asked what he looked like i just want to know what he looks like is all uhhuh so whats he look like is he strange i mean must be nice so whats he like is he like john goddamit give me my tape then i cant believe youre doing this after i let you tape me well what the hell am i supposed to do how about if you record over the one we already made you could have the same date and not use another tape who would know so make an exception but i want you to do it i want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything somebody i can play to and feel safe because you cant do anything now who the hell is going to do that for me i cant talk you into it no not even one more id like to make another tape look im just going to come right out and tell you why im here okay hi he doesnt have to tell me john doesnt have sex with ann anymore prettier than ann do you think im pretty do you like the way i look would you like me to take my pants off then i started moving my hand and then he stopped talking he said that my hand felt good it was warmer than i thought it would be and the skin was softer than it looked its weird thinking about it now the organ itself seemed like a separate thing a separate entity to me i mean after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me no if anything after i looked at it awhile it got more interesting it had character you know not really i didnt picture it with veins or ridges or anything i thought it would be smooth like a test tube very much live when i was fourteen no he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer and then his family moved away to cleveland actually i was eight years old michael green who was also eight asked if he could watch me take a pee i said he could if i could watch him take one too he said okay and then we went into the woods behind our house i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying ladies first so i pulled down my underpants and urinated and he ran away before i even finished my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse cynthia patrice bishop id rather sit are you ready do i sit or stand can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what how long will it take and you ask questions right how do we start would anybody else see the tape is this how you get off or something taping women talking about their sexual experiences and thats all you just want to ask me questions what makes you think id discuss that with you about what doing what well either you are or you arent which is it well they must be something sexual because ann gets freaked out by that shit are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something oh okay i think i get it i think youre right so come on i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked tell me what happened well i dont really listen to her when it comes to men i mean look at john for crissake oh you went to school with him didnt you youre probably friends or something i uh know a guy at the power company nope nope nope she still is well like i said ann is my sister sisters talk you can imagine the rest you want me to leave she must have been in a good mood when she said that she usually calls me loud im ann millaneys sister im cynthia bishop no john things are getting real simple john we have nothing to talk about i know will you please leave now if he had been under your prick youd have spotted him for sure no he didnt put me up to this jesus i dont need people to tell me what i should do ive just been thinking about things thats all who come on john you should be happy weve gone this far without ann finding out im making it real easy on you just walk out of here and ill see you at your house for a family dinner sometime how about straightening up the living room actually no ive changed my mind i shouldnt have called thats right but i never took a vow in front of god and everybody to be faithful to my sister oh please come on john youre fucking your wifes sister and you hardly been married a year youre a liar but at least i know youre a liar its the people that dont know like ann that have to watch out exactly what i said id trust him before id trust you how much clearer can i be yeah i do a helluva lot more than i trust you it wont i trust him no hung up shes a grownup she can handle it why not of course she is my sister i tell her almost everything i felt like it so what goddam you and ann make such a big deal out of it doesnt work he has to know the people he has to be able to interact with them right the wrong hands were not talking about military secrets john theyre just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off i like the way he dresses well you know him hes a friend of yours do you think he can be trusted whats so stupid about it look ill call you okay i dont think my sister would agree i dont know im not sure i can duplicate the level of intensity i had the other day well this is timely your wife is here would you like to speak to her hello then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here right now i want to see you yeah i know what you
