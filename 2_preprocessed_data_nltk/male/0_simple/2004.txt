He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now. You'll have to hurry. Save it for Bourne. What do you mean? Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there's no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push. She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account... No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse. I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak. You told me Bourne was dead. Well, you're probably right. I guess that's all that hubris is. In the end, honestly, it's hubris. Simple hubris. You reach a point in this game when the only satisfaction left is to see how clever you are. Had to be done. Why not? It was just money. I'm not a traitor. I've served my ountry. I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry. Sit down. Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them... Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for? No... It must have been Bourne. Oh, God... It must have been Bourne. What? I wasn't sleeping. You OK? It's hard to swallow. The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick. What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear... There are no answers. There's either Jason Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for one would prefer the latter. And what about her? You just send her out to this lunatic with no protection? My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him. Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need snipers, DOD, whatever they got. Snipers? You don't know what you're getting into here. Berlin! So what's your theory? Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is dead. Conklin might've been a nut, but he wasn't a mole. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I'll prove he killed Lincoln. This is supposed to be definitive? We were throwing money at him. Throwing it at him and asking him to keep it dark. Do you know what his budget was? Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu? Who knows? I've given thirty years and two marriages to this agency. I've shoveled shit on four continents. I'm due to retire next year and believe me, I need my pension, but if you think I'm gonna sit here and let you dangle me with this, you can go to hell. Marshall too. It had to be done. What happened? Jason Bourne happened. You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left. What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it? To know about it? It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here. You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing. And what are we looking for? With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade. Never heard of it. Show me again... Who else knows about this? Lots of people... Keep going... Jesus... It was staged? And? What do you have, Danny? She say what time I should call? Thanks.I'm sorry. I have to go now. No. Because you don't want to know how it feels. I can't let you do that either. Look at me. You know I'm not. It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough. I don't want you to forgive me. They loved you. And I killed them. It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere... I had to change my plan. You understand me? You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that. I killed them. That's not what happened to your parents. It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it? I would want to know. I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself. No. It's because you don't know how they died. It's nice. Does this picture mean anything to you? Hmm? Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer. That's why I came here. Sit. Can you... [The chair. Have the chair.] -- what? -- -- car keys? How long? How long do I have -- You called it in? I did. What's going on in Berlin? Pamela Landy? Who sent you to Greece? You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me? Try again. Conklin. She wouldn't let me. She's the only reason you're alive. You still should've moved. Front. Use your teeth. Drop it. I emptied it. God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you. I only dream about people who are dead. I know it's a dream. It might have. I did. I wanted to kill him. Tell me later. There's no choice. I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave us alone. If he crosses the bridge, it is. I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow. You keep going to the shack. I'll meet you there in an hour. -- yeah -- one guy -- I don't think he was ready -- -- not yet -- -- make the left -- toward the bridge -- Switch! You drive! You drive. -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong! Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't -- We can't wait to be sure. Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver -- No. Not this. This is real. And he's right there... It's wrong. Guy with a rental car and hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent? He was at the campground yesterday. We pushed it. We got lazy. The Telegraph office. But it ends up the same. I should be better by now. It's just a nightmare. I'm trying, Marie, Okay? I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you. -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway! You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that? Two years we're scribbling in a notebook -- No. There's nothing new. Conklin up front. I was here! That's a lie! My first job. For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When? So when was I here? Abbott? Why are you here, then? What was Landy buying? What kind of files? WHAT WAS SHE BUYING? I left a fingerprint! You fucking people. I killed him??? Last week? When? A Russian? Say it. I want to hear it from you. How do they know that? How can they know any of that? Why is she trying to kill me? IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE? Who is Pamela Landy? Get on it. See that tram coming around the corner? You didn't answer my question. Don't need it. I remember everything. What's that? Why am I alive? Oh, shit... Where am I? Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World Clock. Alone. Give her your phone. There was a girl in Paris. Part of the program. She used to handle the medication. I want someone I know to take me in. I want to come in. It's me.The hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I'm frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions. Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago. Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit! It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex. You'd be surprised how often they are. Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad. If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related. Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now. Well, the good news is that the results are negative. I've found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors... It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days. A journal. Just have him write down everything he does. Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory. Hold it, hold it, Andrea. Let's not jump to conclusions. I'll run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out. And you say he doesn't remember any of it? You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one. Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia... Books? Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour. This is where we're finding most of the hemorrhaging. The outer lining of the cerebral cortex. It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before. The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car. Go on. Nothing can hurt you. Remember, this is only a movie. You're completely safe. Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now? Are you hurting her? Where are you now? Now I want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with Lenny. Think of it like a movie. You can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. Understand? Not in this wing, actually. No. Hello, Evan. It's very nice to meet you. He's as handsome as his father.Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here. You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you. Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts. I just need the entry about the blockbuster. Wait, shit, no arms. I never even got the chance to write it. There must be a way to fix this. He's saying it's like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. Overload city. 'Sat about the gist of it, doc? Okay, doc. What's the damage? How much time have I got? Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all! How's Kayleigh doing? She all right? How long will I be in here? What? What could he do? Sure... No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten. Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time? Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades? Please, mom. People will talk. I... I blacked out. I don't know... I don't remember. Okay. I... I don't remember. What happened? These'll bring you luck, Crockett. My father has a bad memory, too? I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures! No. All the dads are gonna be there. But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad... Can't he come out for one day? Um... can dad come this time? Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy. We're putting up pictures for Parent's Night. We're gonna be late again. So you believe me? What did you see? What did it look like? Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess. Just tell me if anything weird happens. So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely. I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams. Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me. You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?" Can you protect me? Photos? But I... I need those books. My journals! Where are they? Where are my goddamn books? Lemme guess. Would that be where the memories are stored? Are you sure? Not even with my father? It's coming... argh! I can't! I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods. I see a car. No, protecting her. I'm standing next to Kayleigh, my hands are over her ears. Yes. Dad lives here? You know my father? Get out. Both of you. Huh? What? Shhh! I need quiet for this. I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off -- All I know is that I might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories. Just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories. It's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. You take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. Then you put a new flatworm in the maze. He's clueless. Banging into walls, getting lost, whatever. This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts. Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday. Then you think it might have worked out? And...? I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? I don't get it. I was? Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us? Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something. He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck. Stop! Take me back! Where are we going? I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit. Don't think I'll need it where I'm going. Which is? That I didn't leave you there to rot. I just thought you should know. Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister. Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh? I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you. I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again. Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts? Yeah? Different? How? Why's that? You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying. The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack. No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been. I get it. You can drop it now. Nice to see you, too. Can I come in? Now's the only time! Today you get a chance to redeem yourself. Start over with a clean slate. Tabula rasa -- I want you to take this, Lenny. Today's your day of atonement. I know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby -- He's a fucking maniac! What? I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us. I walk differently? Like how? What do you mean? Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine. Yeah, right. Tell that to Crockett. Might'a been nice. Like this is gonna do any good. Maybe one of the frat guys has a gun. Simple math. When I woke up this morning and saw your smile... I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. Go on. Sit down. You'll see. What do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? Like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after I moved away? So it didn't feel... weird? I dunno. Just being weird. Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera? Where... where are my clothes? Jesus, Kayleigh, you're... Incredible. You can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak. No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us. I know, but... It's just... did he... what happened in the basement? When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something? Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help. Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts? Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you. Couldn't you have moved in with your mom? Wow. That must've taken some courage. So how's Tommy? Not since we were kids. I'm going to State now. Things are going okay. I guess. Mom's good... Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know... Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change. He must be. They're letting him go, right? Duck, here they come. I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right? What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit. Damn. Your dad did this? I'm sorry. I'm sorry Kayleigh. This was a bad idea. Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help! So let's go. This place creeps me out. Been there, done that. And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass! Listen close then, fuckbag. You screw up again and I swear I'll flat out castrate you. Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa? It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy. Wrong answer, fuckbag. This is the very moment of your reckoning. In the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. The first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood. What time is it? Kayleigh? What happened? I was just somewhere else -- how did I get here? Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go? We're really gonna be in a movie!? Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again. Who's to say you can't make things better? But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me. Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done. Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your -- Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers... You're kidding. Are these the answers?! We'll find out soon enough. Evan Treborn. I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension? I won't let you down, Professor Carter. Oh, fine I guess. It's been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so I haven't... Hey, I got no choice. I'm not sure. I might have gotten some stories mixed up. Did Pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts? It didn't feel like a dream. It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human. Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay? Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven. Thumper had a busy afternoon. Maybe if I can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain. If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh. Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it. Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor. My mom packed for me. I think she sent everything I ever owned. So we'll see. Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh. Y... yes. I guess I did. Yeah, good, what else do you remember? That should buy you ten minutes at least. Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway. Mom. Don't cry. I can change this. Lung cancer? Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father. No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy. What the hell are you doing? Leave us alone you sick fuck! What's wrong with you?! What happened?? Where are we?! Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already? Hey, what'd you do that for? None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here? I come from a big family. Huh?That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off! Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty. ...yes. Who -- who are you? What's happened to -- How are you doing that? It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you. Quit acting like some retard or I'll call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you've been. Calm down, kid. Stand still. That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.No one. Yeah, you told me that later. I remember. I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me. Just a little overworked, maybe. Yeah. Thanks, guys. They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax. I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature! She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house. What old mill? Is that somewhere we -- I can't stop thinking about you. I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic. Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake. I don't know. Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests. That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid. Says you were a bully... I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you. Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that. -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now. Have sex. Y'know -- Listen, did you want to make love? I think I should go back. I don't know. What if it breaks? I don't know. Yeah. Tomorrow? Yeah. I love you. I walked out the door. There's no more memory. I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain. I think we should go. Naomi. It's dark. I knew. I hesitated for what seemed like forever. What are you doing? Female. I do sort of live with somebody though. Um, no. Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"? Seems too coincidental that way. Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house? I think she's great. I love her. Okay. yeah? I don't think I've slept in a year. I know what you mean. That's why I stopped. Enjoy it. Say good-bye. I know. Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic. You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing? I'm Joel. And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. You said -- You know what I did. Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? Yeah. I don't ever know what to say. You said... Hi. It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that. You had the whole human race pegged. I remember that speech really well. Okay. Not yet. Not married. I'd like to... take you out or something. Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you. I did it. I guess that means something. I told her today I need to end it. It's very late. I dropped you off after. You said -- And I didn't have an argument. I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said: I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences. I'm sure, I said. We did talk about Naomi. Right. Something black though. No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons. God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper. Yeah. Do you remember what we talked about? I want to enjoy my little time left with you. I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working. I scoured the city for it. Happy Birthday. I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to -- This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me. They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now. Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally. He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased! There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him. There's this guy! I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like -- I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties. I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose... I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you, Clem. What do you mean? I don't know. I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore. Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem! No. Yeah, Tangerine? No. Thanks. I just don't have anything very interesting about my life. No, it isn't that. You're drunk. So, um -- Oh, thank God. It's going. Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have -- I don't want to talk about this here. Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid? I don't think we're ready. Let's talk about it later. Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go? Where are you going? Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy. Let me drive you home. No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you? I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody. Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody. I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic. It's three. How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone? Okay. Tomorrow? Yeah. So, I enjoyed meeting you. Yes. I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so... Sounds good. But right now I should go. Okay. I think so. That's scary sounding. Oh, yeah. No, not at all. No. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. It's hard to -- Yeah. Thanks. I do have a tendency to use that word too much. I think about that. Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know. I don't know. Yeah? Thanks. No. I -- Well, I should probably get going. You just say. I'm not really -- What do you want to hear? No, I'm okay for now. I'm fine. Cheers. It's pretty. Frost? I don't know. Thanks. That was good, that crow sound. Very much. Um -- Take care. Well, I wouldn't want to be -- What? Sort of, um... Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But -- I like to read. It's okay. I didn't think you were. Yeah. I'm not a stalker. Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no. Where do you live? It's okay. You're sure? It's cold. Hi. I could give you a ride if you need. Probably see you at the book store. It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to -- That's okay. Yes? Okay. Well, anyway... Sorry. Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so -- See, I wouldn't think that about you. Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right? I'm not nuts. I don't know what that means. I don't know any jokes about your name. I'm Joel. Sorry. I was just trying to be nice. Oh, I doubt that's the case. You sure? That doesn't sound -- I'm sure you would. You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be? I don't really know how -- I can't remember. Yeah. Tom Waits says it in -- I like it. I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you. I don't have one. -- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before. Really? Because -- The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right? Rockville Center. It's okay, really. I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to -- No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably. Anyway. Sorry. Hi. Well, I didn't want to assume. No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so... Why what? I'm sorry. Jesus. I don't know. Panties and -- You must have been crazy. I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you. Hi, it's Joel. Look, I have to go. I have to think. It's true. That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke. I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this? Did you send this? Is it a joke? I guess so. Oddly enough, I do. I just walked in. There you are. Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had... I just got in. I know. I had to take the day to think. How's it going? Hi, Naomi, it's Joel. I really should go. I really need to catch my ride. Clementine. So you're still on the Zoloft? But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye. Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt. Okay. I wish you could come. Naomi. I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later. I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging. How's the chicken? And what are you like? A wino? Any messages, Carmen? So then she just stops calling. Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is! Clementine. I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and... I should maybe talk to you. It's them. Pink. There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718? I have to follow through with this. I have no choice. Fuck you, Clementine. I might be making a mistake. The driver waved. So casual, friendly. It was snowing. I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now! You have to stop this! It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way... Well... I did. Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? We'll speak soon. I had a good time last night. I really did. So you think the dissertation will get published? I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have -- Oh! Great. That's great! I miss you. Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry. It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. I hope you get your work done. So you don't mind? In a minute. Go back to sleep. You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello. Hi. It's not somebody else. No. I just need some space, maybe. I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition. Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and -- I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other. Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch. You take it. I don't know.I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there. You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him? Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on? How are you today? Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too. What? What do you mean? We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine. I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have. Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss. We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking. I didn't make you. You thought it best. But, look, I take full responsibility. It was a mutual decision. I have a family, Mary. I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here. We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later. We can't do this. I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that. It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it. That's lovely. It's no big deal. Alexander Pope? It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it. Is that Nietzsche? Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some. How do you mean? Well, thank you, Mary. Okay, we're back in. Thanks. Order me a pastrami for after? Mary... Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in. Jesus. All right, what's the address. Well, where was Patrick? Okay, what happened right before he disappeared? Stan? What's going on? Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people. She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably -- Thanks, Stan. Thanks. That's fine, Stan. Oh dear. Yeah, probably a good idea. Did you try going through C-Gate? Mary. What are you doing here? Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met. I didn't have a chance to wrap it. I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing. Um, okay. I'll call my study partner. Sure. We'll go next weekend and -- Oh, Tangerine. Oh, baby, what's going on? In the world. It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room. I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow. I can't. I want to, but I have to study. I was not. I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood. Definitely! Very cool. Trippy. Yeah. Cool. Nah, I don't know. Hi, Mary. How's it going? Thanks, Stan. I owe you. She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset. Hold on. Let me ask my friend. Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very -- What's your bartlett's? Okay, There's more, Stan -- Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies. She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what. I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night. The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation. Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend? I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now. I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me. Yeah? Yeah. Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy. Does that help? The voltage looks fine.Mary... please. This is hurting people. The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased. Mary, people come to him voluntarily. I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. I know what it is. What's this? Can I... I brought some -- Hi. You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car. He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love. I really like you, Mary. You know that. I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things. Happy. Happy with a secret. It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled. Once, maybe. I swear. Hey. You better go. No way. I can handle this. Shit! I don't know! I just said that! I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap... I don't know. He's not on the map. It's not erasing. He's off the screen. Listen, it's not erasing. It's stopped. You love him, don't you? Yeah. Go. Yup. Yup. It's a good one all right. That's a good one. We haven't checked. You found us okay? Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you -- See you later, alligator. I know. Anyway -- Sorry. I just -- Boo. Jesus. I don't know what you're talking about, Howard. So, I've got to drop the van off. I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds. Howard, they've disappeared again. You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here. Yeah. Of course. I tried that already. She came to help, Howard. December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long. I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway. Patrick, we're in the middle of -- It's a quote book. Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties. Jesus, Patrick! She was unconscious, Patrick. Patrick, we need to focus. This one's history. Moving on... You can if you want. She likes you okay. Just wanted to let you know. Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us. It's an apartment. Yeah, that looks better. Thanks. Then check the connections.Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind. Didn't even buy me a drink. I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow! I'm lucky that way. Nah -- he's taken care of. Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed. Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out -- Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works. We don't take hints. How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I drive around in a garbage truck Don't get psychic with me. I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding. Outside. I could be outside -- Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us. Skip to the end, willya? How do I kill it -- ? See? I don't like that -- That's all for you, Sammy. Oh, as opposed to -- ? How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here! Is it bad? Oh, stop that -- Damn! Be careful, there -- Me?? C'mon -- How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!! Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough -- Reliquary -- Who wards off demons. This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me? Her. Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions. C'mon, Champ! Happy Halloween!!! You're taking me for a walk! Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song. "Myers", huh? You have a first name?? I wanted to see her. It's nobody's business. I don't want him. Got tired of me? Who's the squirt? I can live with that. Anung-un-Rama... Noooo! Noooo!!! Don't tell me, it's Zeppo. That voice -- My job. Yup. You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you. No. Don't -- Don't move. We -- I won't take 'em. They never work. Those things never work. Never. "One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs. I wish I could be more gracious but -- What are you trying to say? No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I? I knew those men better than you did -- How big can it be? Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there. On a scale of one to ten: two. But -- -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one. Good night. Not from you. Not hungry. Nah, sounds too "needy." Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" -- Shh! Just a second. What was that?? What landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? Punctuality? What was your area of expertise? Hey. You: think twice -- Mmmh -- "Pamcakes." We're going out -- Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head -- That's right, Stud, hold me down. Could've fooled me. Go away. What are you, a Boy Scout? What took you so long? Goodbye. Myers? No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break. I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up. Myers??? How's your arm? No one ever helps me. It's my job. Whatcha looking at, John?? Father's back? Still angry? Those comics -- They never got the eyes right. ...Polo. Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything... Good. Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this -- But I can't. I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever. But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there -- Hi. It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished -- You're going alone? Out? Out out? Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear. Goodnight, then. We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me -- Come back, Liz. Come back. I -- Just a scratch. I wanted to see you.Oh, please. I'm not "pure of heart." I'm in way over my head, I know that much. 1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45. "In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..." On the desk, yes. In Latin. Where am I -- exactly, Sir? How does he know so much about me? Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865. Sir, may I go first?? His what??!! Uh-oh -- John. Staring at what? Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real -- Who?! Grounded? Who's grounded? Alone? Are you sure about this? Well good n- Anything else you -- Hey, your chili's getting cold -- Start in, you got nachos coming. "Need" is a good, solid word. Where do you -- Hostage negotiations. I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back. Professor, that girl you were talking about -- Down there. Did you ever loose track of him? You want me to hold him down? No. I never was. C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up. Yes? No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are -- Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you -- My arm is fine. Where are you?? Helping you -- I just -- Oh-n-no -- I -- Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you. You're kidding -- What? That you feel that way about me. But it's not true, is it? It's freezing, isn't it? What about you? He -- loves you. My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects. Strong. No... He's determined. Unstoppable -- I admire him. He's a force of nature. Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice. Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the Bureau. No special precautions, no security escorts. You and me in a taxi. Like regular folks. It's still impressive by my standards: My name's John. Liz -- can I call you Liz? It's a beautiful name -- Pardon? Yes, I -- Hello, I'm --Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been. I'm not... easy. Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address. My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking? Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want? So you are going to talk me to death. Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death? It's not worth it. Be with them instead. I don't know shit about you. What do you want? It's what you and Rosanna named me. Right? Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere. Am I a suspect? No. What am I doing here? [It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.] [I have a friend there.] [I'm on to Juarez.] [South America.] Where? I show, you give me the information? You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you. Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos. Give me the address. Where does he live? What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos? I'll call you tomorrow. I need something. Do you have banking connections? Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks. I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches. Maybe I can help your situation and you mine. It's a little late. I guess that makes you the smart one. [What is his name?] [So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.] [Daniel what?] [What is his name?] [How do you contact 'the Boss'?] [Reina Rosas.] [Who's Tazinari?] [What money?] [Who's the boss?] [Don't lie to me.] [Who killed her? You?] [The number you use at the bank machine.] [What's the PIN number?] [Who pays you?] [How does it work?] [Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.] [Not for a long time, sister.] [So am I, Sister.] [Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.] [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?] [How do I recognize him.] Who's he? [Who's he?] [Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.] [I believe you.] [Where do I find him?] [Who ordered it?] [Ordered by who?] [The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?] [Who are you?] [You are Jorge Ramirez.] [Drive.] [You're a liar. Pinta's dead.] [What do you mean?] [Yeah. Yes.] [Your brother wants to talk to you.] [I want you.] [I told you, non-negotiable.] [It's non-negotiable.] [I want you.] [Hello Daniel. I've got your family and I want to negotiate.] [That's what everybody keeps saying.] [Who gave the bags to Ramos?] [Maybe your men stole from you.] [Don't lie to me!] [The ransom was ten.] [O.K. So tell me more.] [You stole the drop.] [And?] [Lucky how?] [It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.] [And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad.] I'll probably kill them. Is that likely? My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay. I drink. It's loaded. Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226. Yes. Cut the stock here. The barrel here. Make sure you file it smooth. Rocket launchers? I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32. Yes or no? Stomach's gone. But... okay. Pinta... Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan? Sorry I woke you, Ray. Maybe... I mean nothing. The hammer came down and nothing happened. Dimple on the primer. There's still ink on my fingers from last week. Oh, now you think I can be trusted. A bodyguard... Who's the guy? I came to visit you. A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that. And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt? You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk? Everything happens once if you live long enough. Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse. Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting. And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable. Yeah, right... But don't you stay in El Paso? So how's business? Nothing wrong. It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane. Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught. I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it. I'm here. When did Mexican Customs start getting smart? You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours. Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13. Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic. Be a swimmer. Then be trained. Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that. That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride. Pinta, we've got to go. Travel sucks at this time. Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears. Still not a question. That's not a question. Could I stop you? The blocks. Your father has business. There's no such thing as tough. You're either trained or untrained. You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound. The gunshot holds no fear. Say it. I know you're not. I dropped her at home. I'm sorry. Yeah. Two or three. No. I guess that really does make me a hard case. Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you. Remember you asked me what state I was from? Don't worry. You will. You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself. No, that was in Columbia. I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history. You feel sorry for the husband? In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules. Well, it's a sort of wife. Why do you ask? You need to practice. In a week you should be fine. How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it? Did you sleep alright? I don't talk to them much. Does he have a name? Do you always sleep with him? White lie. I didn't have a family. But I did have two kids. They're adults now. I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else? Where? They'll be back in a week. Yes. Actually, he was driving me crazy. Well, I let him go. No. Do you think he'll come back? What are you doing? You're fast. Pinta, do you have a pencil? And don't start crying. Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it. It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna. No. No. That's right. Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun. Time will tell. I'm a bargain. Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking? Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. I'm looking for potential. No. No. The United States. Creasy. Just call me Creasy. Who's Emilio? Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.] If they like me. Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back. Then don't come. I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes. An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity. They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus. Because... I was already dead. If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier. Sorry. It is serious, Mrs. Ramos. Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable. You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right? No. We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy. The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat. I'm fine. Never. So are you. It's war. The weakest suffer the most.Creasy... I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances. You have no interest in making things easy, do you? No, but I have to admit I thought about it. I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing. You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want. My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works. It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours. My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats. He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil. The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that? The last few days may represent the best police work of my life. Sit, Creasy. Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission. Really. You won't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico. Hombre en fuego. Man On Fire. That's what the papers have named you. All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood. No. It would be convenient, but no. You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long. Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can. This page? [He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.] [I should start going for your tits first.] [A beautiful circle.] [You only fuck me to get information.] [I think he's... magnificent.] [When you talked to him, did he look sane?] [Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.] [It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.] [I know this. Your point?] [We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.] [He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.] [Is that good or bad?] And they took that away. What was she to Creasy then? I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that. This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does. What happened to him? What happened to Creasy? You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders. You two were a married couple. Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better. You helped him get this job. I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together. Tell me about your friend Creasy. Pollo Pibil. Chicken and chorizo sausage. Hmmmh. They marinate it in lemon and orange juice. It's a stew really. So am I. I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.Different door. Not far from here. I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us. I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours. Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed. I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital. Two days gone. They're negotiating a ransom. You got three of the fuckers. All dead. I said the plan was right here. Creasy? I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off. You mean a misfire? You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials. Oh you know that? Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not. Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust. Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit. What are you doing here? So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that. It's not exactly a scam, Crease. Even at half speed you're pretty damn good. You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles. Well, you'd have to keep it under control. Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part. You did something on impulse? How long you staying, Crease? You been working? Oh, like you haven't been in worse places. Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here. Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne. Don't give me that bullshit. So what's wrong? This is Mexico, they do everything backwards. Everything happens once if you live long enough. You got a secondary search and you had a gun. What do you mean, I'm here? Creasy??? Where the fuck are you? A man can be an artist in anything. Stone, paint, words. Food. Anything if his soul is true to it. Creasy's art is death. And he's about to paint his masterpiece. Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again. Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead. He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way. None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say. The kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends. I can take care of myself. That's what friends do. Two tourists who never went home. You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say. I already ate. He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him. He's not a cop killer.Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby? No, we're from San Diego. Why? Nice technique there... ...Cammi. I love you. Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay? I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked. Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler? I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes. Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me. Well, then put him at the singles table. So what's up? Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast. It's Christine. Hey you. Don't bother him with that. We got to get going. Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do. Two years ago, buddy. Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something. Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash. Is it chicken? Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious. You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond. Yeah, well, you should be my agent. Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago. They're from both of us. I can explain. Hi. Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here. Me too. Great. You look great. You both do. How you doin' tonight, beautiful? You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie. No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her. You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post? Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn. Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie? Nice. Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name? Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah. I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal. Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit. I am one of those guys. Maybe. Recognize this? A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly. No, I'm an actor. That's on us. Hiya. You were wearing your belt. Hey, don't pull away till they see the car. Love you, man. So I'll see you at the rehearsal. Why don't you come in? Whatever. Sorry. You need a new car anyway. I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one. I'll pay for it. You said it looked like a car accident. Nothing. Buckle up, okay? I feel like driving. Come on, let me drive. You're so negative. Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding? Want me to drive? Yep. Quite a day. Hrnrnrn? Fuck you. I'll get it myself. Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that. My ankle. Just go explain the situation. The plan is... you go. Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout. Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five. Yeah. Please, Miles, please. No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me. You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet. I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back. We gotta go back. Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean. Ran. Twisted my ankle too. Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass. Fucking chick's married. She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe. I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type. I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time. You know what I'm thinking? What's it look like to you? You sure you didn't say anything to Maya? So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary. Yeah. Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine. I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again. You told him. I'm fucking hurting here. Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you? See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that. Don't give up. You're going to make it. What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is. What's that supposed to mean? Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right? What's up? I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot. I say we check it out. You never know. You ever actually been in there, Miles? How about this one? We didn't hit this one. Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty. I know what you need. Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me. Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's... Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry. You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo. You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot. What? So tell me everything. Details. I like details. Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy? Huh. You ever actually read any of this guy's books? I SAID OKAY? I said okay? We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay? We're on. Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it. Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that? With Maya. Is it the money thing? All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson? Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence. Hey, asshole! That's not cool! I don't know. Got it from Stephanie. Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. Here. Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet. Don't come over the top. Stay still. But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say? Huh. Been checking your messages? What do you think's going on? What about your agent? Hear anything yet? Nice shot. You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot. Oh yeah. Sure. She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you. Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday? She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy. This is our day! Call me on my cell if you go out. Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay? Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong. You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche. What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine. Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even. This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married? Look who's talking. You've been there. Like I might be in love with another woman. I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it. Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep. I may have to put the wedding on hold is all. Well, I've been doing some thinking. Well... I don't know, just... the wedding. Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides... What? Upstairs. Getting cleaned up. What're you drinking? Hey, there you are. Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool. Okay! Jesus! I will. See ya! Yeah. Okay. Oh, boy. Later. Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude. You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all -- Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike. Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty. Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua. And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place. Oh Jesus, Miles. Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on! Did you drink and dial? Where were you? Pull yourself together, man. And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side. Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax? And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot. Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me. Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall. I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer. You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come? Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it. Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on. Been divorced for a year now, bud. She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out. We're on. Get the trunk. A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked. I'm a quick learner. No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool. Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party! What do you think? You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something. Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out! About a month ago. Six weeks. Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried. Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding. Miles. Beautiful. No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share. Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me? I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit. So what's the plan today? Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles. She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator. Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle. No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock. Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married. I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit. The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published. The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles! You're blind, dude. Blind. Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you? Perfect. Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere. Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her? So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over. Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her? She is very hot. You know that chick? You know her? Here's to my last week of freedom. Yeah. Tight. Yeah. It's good. Feels good. It does. Feels right. We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down. No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along. Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff. Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it. You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine? We should have driven. I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out. Just a minute! Want some? You know, you could work in a wine store. How would you rate this one? When do we get to drink it? Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese. I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes? Huh. What color is it supposed to be? Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir. This is rose, right? Baked with a butter-lime glaze. I owe her a call anyway. Let me call Christine. I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish? I told you. Filet and salmon. Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells. I thought you hated Chardonnay. Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass. And get your bone smooched. Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need. Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax? You still seeing that shrink? No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books. It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit. Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages. That's your problem, Miles. Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean? And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man. Just a second. Guy's going for $2500. That's a good age. How old's she going to be? Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago. What? Whoa, why are we getting off? Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different. Oh yeah. Much better. I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure is tasty. Just tell me. Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark? Oh, that's tasty. Yeah. Shut up. Here's to a great week. Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it. I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me. Yeah, Conundrum. You said you had it all lined up. Come on. You're fucking hungover. Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.So I guess that's it. Yeah, I'm here. Huh. And? Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word? Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client. I'm good. Say, is Maya working? Bottle. Highliner. You know me. I love it up here. How about you? Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit. Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding. What are you pouring tonight? Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week. Gary. Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured? Back at you. Yeah. Uh-uh. You're on your own. Well. That about does it. No, not whatever. You fucking derelict. You broke some. Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't. Look at this! What the fuck! What the fuck! What's wrong? I'm fine. You rest. Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again. No, I'm okay. Quite a week. That was quite a day yesterday. Hey, Jack. Jack. Hold on. Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering... Me? So what's the plan? Cutting it a little close, don't you think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say. So what the fuck were you thinking? She tell you she was married? Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day. No way. No way. Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand. Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards. What? That's five clicks, Jackson. Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang? What? You're joking, right? What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home? I don't know. I wouldn't know. Uh-huh. What's that? Looks like you were in a bad car accident. Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot. Huh. Let me think. That's thoughtful. Good thing you have a voice-over career. Well? Keep it elevated. No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night. Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her? Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski. Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage. Thanks. You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published. No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself. I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn. Let me use your phone. Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid. I don't have to. Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke. Are they too sporty? Do you like them? We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here. This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home. Shut up! Shut up, Jack! Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up. Let's leave it alone. It's private. No. Put me down, Jack. He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted. You have to tell me -- What exactly are we going to do? What's happening? Slaughterhouse. Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir. Is what the money thing? I don't want to talk about it. Throw me his ball. Fucker hit into us. What is it? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP! Shut up. They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life. Obsessively. Could be anything. Nope. You're an asshole. Thanks, Jack. Can you give me some room here? Nope. That's a public course. No Stephanie? Yeah. Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie. That was three years ago after that first party! What? Of course I like Christine. You're crazy. You've gone crazy. And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh? Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now? In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything? Understanding of what? Deep. Oh, you've been thinking. And? What? Besides what? Does she know about Saturday? With this chick. What the fuck are you doing? Where is Stephanie? Yep. What'd Christine say? Right now. You should call her. She's been leaving messages here too. Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first. Count me out. We were supposed to play golf. Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished. Shut up. Shut your face. Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario. Bathroom. I'm fine! Okay! Fuck! If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot! Aye-aye, captain. Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called? So what should I wear? Nah. I want to watch this. Well, she is cute. With Maya? What? You have the keys. Do you know how often these pourers get hit on? You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir. You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it? I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin? You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before? Is she bringing him to the wedding? I want to go home now. To that guy? That guy with the restaurant... She what? When? I know. You told me. I'm okay with it. She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines. Victoria and I used to like this view. Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care. Nice, huh? Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back. Ooooh, now the cards are on the table. We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel. So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard? Fuck you. Have you no shame? Shut up. How do you know? Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her. Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack. Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired? She works for tips! Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work? And she likes Pinot. Well, she does know a lot about wine. You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot. This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara. And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock. Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half. Sure I know Maya. Oh, yeah. That's Maya. It's going to be great. Here's to us. Pour us a couple. Then it's a good thing. If that's what feels right. Uh-huh. So you're going to stop acting? Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life. Whoa. Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back. It's not even a mile. Hey Jack, hurry up! Are you chewing gum? Yeah, that would be a good move. Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris? Now. That's what you do with every one. Now set your glass down and get some air into it. What do you smell? Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it. Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever... First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity. Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir. Now we're talking. Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste. Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference. Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry? So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu? Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are. I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation. These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. Look how beautiful this view is. What a day! You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first. Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style. And Lexapro, yes. I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer. I'm working on it. I'd rather have a knife. It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free. As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place. She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore. This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you. Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't -- Um... seventy... something. It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway. I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother. I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second. There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same. How about the new ending? Did you like that? And? Did you read the latest draft, by the way? Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color. Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron. 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore. You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen. Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together. That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it! Don't open that now. It's warm. It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring. ...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already. No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum... Why did you tell them my book was being published? Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box. I can't help the traffic. It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State. Oh, Maya. No. Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but... I'm sure he believed every word. He's an actor, so it can't be good. I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control. Maya. Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth. No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner. Okay. Great. What's the latest we can get there? Well, nice to see you now. Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you. Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense. Um... did you still want to read my novel? Good. So did I. Got it. Bathroom over there? Yeah? Like what? I don't know. Why are you into wine? I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you? Sure. My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good. I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos... So... you want to work for a winery or something someday? Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here. A paper? Yeah. Thanks. Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution. Um... yeah but it's more... "The Day After Yesterday." Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context. Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids. Is she sleeping or...? Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute. Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money. Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you? What was the bottle that did it? How long have you been into wine? I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary. Yeah, I know. Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc. She got anything good? Hi. Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood. That's what I'm having. This is good. Little hints of clove. On a Sauvignon Blanc? Nice. Very nice. Oh yeah? How is it? What are you drinking? See you. The Windmill. I finished it. You want to join us? You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya. Oh, no, actually. Busy night. Maya, how are you? Yeah. Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news. You quit drinking? Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds. Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy. Universally rejected. Strike three. Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse. That's great. That was big of him. Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful. I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just -- You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe. Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun. Ken. I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name? Hello? A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night. Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune! Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round. Victoria! How the hell are you? Victoria. I told you I need a drink. Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it. Good stuff. French or American? Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak? How much skin and stem contact? Stephanie! Stop! Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl. Where? Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it. You golf? Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago. Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing. He had to make a phone call. Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive. She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie. Should we get dessert? Exactement! Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe -- Quaffable but far from transcendent. I just got divorced. Phyllis. Uh-huh. I'll be right back. Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes. You talked to Wendy? It was a surprise, Mom. A famous actor who's getting married next week.Winona. She's buried. Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back. You heard? Hi there. Dylan here. Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her. Show's over, boys. Nobody home. And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night. Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered? I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response. Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look? No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested? What's the bad news? Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan. I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away. Who knows. Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished. I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you. Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh? That's right, Jan. Ten miles back on the Texas side. Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here... ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo. Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back. Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online? Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it? He said it was a clue? Let's take a look at it. Drop off my stuff at the hotel after you're done here. You have the photo from the diner? What's with the eyelids? What about his killer? Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you. What are you doing? Another what? What? Smarter than us. We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know? Chuck, hello. This is Agent Kulok. She has a background in medical forensics. Dick Low's a killer too. Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target. We'll wait. Get online with Low, inform him of Zero's route -- we'll set a trap for him. Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo? He's got you believing in Zero now too. As far as the public knows, Richard Low is dead. And he will stay dead until we kill him. Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal. The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed. There was talk of a file photo. That breaks my confidentiality stipulation. I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames. You didn't tell anyone where you were? Why did you go to Chicago? I want to catch Dick Low, more than you can imagine, but I cannot risk going public. What happens when the media finds out that a former FBI Special Agent, a founder of the Behavioral Sciences Unit, is not dead, but instead alive and killing people, not ordinary people, but, even worse, serial killers, making him some sort of white knight vigilante? You keep at it. We'll find him, we'll find him in our own way. How do you send out an APB on a dead man? We're waiting for trace evidence results on the Rice killing. Collected shoes too? It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him. I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here. Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys. Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close. Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file. We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero. That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met. "Murman" was the alter identity of William Heirens, the original "Catch Me Before I Kill Again" killer. Short for "Murder Man." It was the case that got Richard Low and I started in this field. Mack the Mouth at a loss for words. I don't believe this. Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first? You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway? I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you? I'll take it into consideration. You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing? Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms. The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage? Do you think he singled you out? Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard. How do you feel, Agent Its called insubordination. You refused to comply with a direct order. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is not based on personal preference. We share information. I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned. I'll relay this to CIIAC. From the grave? Who? This better be important. Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up. Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass. You are so fucked up. You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me. Don't you touch him. Thank you, Rangers. Put this man in the unmarked.Testa? Besides that. Was this him? Does Koessler know about the Suspect Zero theory? Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials. No. Have you had a chance to think about -- I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota? You have the body? What? I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case. Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me? Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong. The room key's in the car. On the seat. Let's take a look. What does the Manager say? Hey, Sheriff. I'm on my way. You tell me. Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news. Agent Mackelway. This isn't in our database? You're thinking...? I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself. I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor. Where's the Nuevo American Diner? Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI? You run the plates? We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns. Turn the body over. There was something in the autopsy report, yes, here. These burn marks. I'm sorry. This won't take long. Put a BOLO out on that. What kind? He was sitting here? How did you know he was a construction worker? What did he look like? The man who was with him, he was a construction worker? You're as crazy as he is! He's right! You don't give a damn about saving lives at all! Fuck you! There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now. What about Zero, Darryl Hawkins? I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days. I need to get to Amarillo immediately. I understand. In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir. I didn't use Low's name. I was looking for a pattern. An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket. I was visiting an old college friend. Huh?, sir. We need to put out an NCIC inquiry. I got a look in Testa's computer. His screen name was "Imelda." Have to give him that, had a sense of humor. What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory? You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro." How long ago? You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso. "Was?" I spoke with Lloyd Daitz. I'm hesitant to... Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing. Had trouble sleeping last night, sir. They like my stories. They like the way I think. They're into fantasy. I turn them on. What I do requires confidentiality. If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok? This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently. Go ahead. No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it? He got away. I had him. He got away. Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him. Then why do I still have a badge? I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again. Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way. I had gotten their trust. We were sharing fantasies. I couldn't risk it. They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms -- MyDick. Speck. Harold Speck. I think I talked to him. Look, sorry. Don't say a word. I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington. I'm going to Amarillo. Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information. Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country. Jaime -- I've got to take a piss. I haven't changed anything. Damn. But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low. That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low. Low calls him Suspect Zero. Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection. Yeah, of course. Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that. But why this pattern? Jaime, do you think, when this is all over, when we're in different divisions, you think maybe you and me, we could try again? I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it. Don't worry, I've cleared it. They say Richard Low is wrong, but because of him, women, innocent women, are alive who would be dead. It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us. I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low. Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret. I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory. You were right. He found me. I met with Richard Low. These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on. I guess I'm a little paranoid. That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so. Start killing people for real? My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago. What's up? Jaime? Where are you? Don't confuse what we do with who we are. Not the way I can. I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out. What's that? That's true. Oh. I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence. You did. No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that. Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman. Did they disconnect Testa's computer? You mean -- The tattoo? Jesus. We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet? Find the feet? Not about coming to see Daitz? What did you tell him? Does Koessler ask about me? I know. "Intra-Agency fraternizing." Oh yeah, I forgot. Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison? You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd. When you were his student? Did he come on to you? I saw him on a talk show once, talking about these killers like they were his friends. Not the victims, not the families of the victims, he doesn't talk about them. Blood money, that's what it is. Did he hit on you? I ever get like that, just take me out in back and shoot me. That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now? None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature. Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her. Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking? He thinks he looks young. Look at this fellow... or this one. What's that? I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together. People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us. Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring? Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month." No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler. Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence. The other reason? That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how. Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible. The man knew how to dress. Yes I do. Where's my watch? It's gone. That information's being withheld from the media. This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have? We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists. Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental. Why did he come out here? What's going on? You work with Koessler? How long have you been downtown? The Academy, then CIIAC. Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say. They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense. Yeah. Yeah. You? You went by the book? Maybe you should back off. Those were just fantasies. It was the mall. Who told you about her? I already have an employer. You knew it was me all along? How do you know who's real and who's not? Daitz hinted it existed. It was a matter of forming the request in the proper terms. Zero killed them all? The file, however, was kept open after your death. NPE disappearances, No Plausible Explanation, were sometimes filed there, deleted if the bodies were found. "Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..." I don't carry it with me. So you went underground? Suspect Zero? What was your weakness, sir? He's moved on to TV. I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz. I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops. Yes, sir. Yes. Who are you? How did you know Speck was a killer? Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover. I want to go live with you. George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler. Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret? I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation. I want to help you. Let's talk about Zero. Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you. Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try. If I owe, I will go. I've been to Chicago. Lead the way, Murman. Something came up, Murman, my man. Whatever happened to MyDick? Lionheart here. I'm back. Sorry about the absence. I had to do some therapy at the crossbar hotel. Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low. I don't think you understand. This man, Hawkins, has killed dozens of people. Suspect Zero. Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo. Now, Mr. Hawkins, when last in Amarillo, where did you get gas? How far is Amarillo? He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it. I talked to him. Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick. MyDick. As in my dick. That was his screen name. No. Koessler? Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon. Yes, sir. I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about. I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request. Four hundred and sixty, sir. I screwed up twice, sir. Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir. Thomas Mackelway. I believe it's in my file, sir. Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. Agent Salinas, sir. It's over for you. He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you. I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent. You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.What do you mean? Ask me. Ask me anything. Sure. It's crazy out there. Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face? I know. I'm just saying I understand. I'm just talking, man. I get horny as hell for other women. I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman. Don't talk like that. You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man. The important thing is that you and Annette need to talk. She needs to see you, and you need to see her. It's not what you think. C'mon, Walter. Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet. Early July. Soon. Aren't you glad? Annette will see you. I've got some good news. Ah, come on. I've got some pictures. Want to see? Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty. She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White. What party? Fucking Mariners. What's happening? I know, man. I love this table too. But I also love my wife. She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it. It wasn't like that. You need a table. It was a beautiful present. Yeah. It's really nice. It's a nice table. Huh? This little table is one heavy bitch. She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come... I remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor Annette married." Except her brother. You treated me with respect. Look, you paid your dues. Your slate is clean now. I don't know. She won't talk about it. I'm working on it. Annette? She's good... tense. I should go. Your sister worries, and when she worries she yells. But maybe it's not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school. No way, man, you'd rob me blind! What? I was just thinking of... the noise. Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus. Hey, is that a school? I'll never forget you got me started there. Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys... Five years. Foreman now. Oh man, that kid takes himself real serious. You doing okay? You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now! Took some talking to convince your super I was a relative.You sure you don't know nothing about this? Well, I guess I'll be seeing you. Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow. The passionate one? I'd say you're moving. What's with the boxes? That's a nasty scratch on your neck. Just give me a straight answer, Walter, cause the irony goes right over my head. He I.D.'d the assailant. The description matches you pretty well. I could take you downtown. The assault took place at approximately seven thirty. I didn't say what time the assault occurred. A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that? I'll be asking the questions. Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts? You don't know? What? That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch. Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half? Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive. The one with the ax? Neither do I. What's the one with the woodsman? Do you believe in them? This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door. Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it. You believe in fairy tales? You walked home. Don't be witty. Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter? Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships. Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun. Too much sun. Okay? Like a piece of shit? In my eyes, you are a piece of shit. Think anyone would miss you if I threw you out the window right now? I could say you jumped when I came in. Who are they going to believe? Not you, because you'd be a dead piece of shit. And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off? Who said I wanted to buy it? Unusual design for a contemporary piece. Cherry? I could get a search warrant. Got something to hide? Then you won't mind if I look around. I think you do. You don't know? Have a seat. Hiya, Walter.How do you feel about that? It's going to take time, Walter. Accept you? All right. A small house... with small rooms. When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house. I meant later... when you two took naps. Did you get an erection? You felt pleasure. What else? I'm only asking questions. Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes? Walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there. All right. Did you and your sister often take naps together? A nap? And what are you doing? But roughly, how old? How old are you and your sister? Where are you? Where? Sorry. Where is she? Where is she? What is she doing? How old -- Who do you see? In your mind, Walter. Take your time. No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see? When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember? No, I am not going to -- Close your eyes and let your mind be blank. To relax. I'd like you to close your eyes. Close your eyes. That's not a helpful answer. If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes. When did it all start? I can't move my patients around to accommodate one person. Please don't do it again. You're very late. Go home, Walter. We'll talk about it more on Thursday. Walter, we'll pick up here next time. I want you to calm down. Is this the first one? What did you want to happen? What did you think would happen? I know you're frustrated, Walter, but -- I know -- Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal! Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you. Why don't we continue this on Thursday. What is your idea of being normal? They usually tell me. I don't. I suppose it's however society defines it. I'm afraid not. I couldn't say. We have a lot of work to do. We have a few more minutes. That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around. Is that what you are angry about? Why do you think you're here? Do you think you're crazy? Have you talked to Carlos about your concerns? What are you afraid will happen? Then why are you talking about this? You have no feelings for your niece? How do you feel about that? Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung. Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name. Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch? Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here? But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter. You don't like coming here, do you? I wish you'd give it a try. How's the journal? Then think about it. Try it. By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals. It's very good, indeed. That's right. I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect. It was just an idea. Oh. It never crossed my mind. I don't understand. Why not? That's right. I'd like you to keep a journal. Walter, I'd like you to try something for me. No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist. You seem a little hostile today. That's right, you did. Have you made any friends there? Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there? And how's your job?I mean... feelings. Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna? Nothing. Carlos, can I ask you something? Maybe because you're looking her in the face. Carlos, I never raped a woman. You don't have to tell me this. Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad. I'm not a monster. Isn't it? You should see my appointment book. It got crazy. Tell Annette I'm busy in July. Next week? The week after? When? What's that? I don't want to see any goddamn pictures. No thanks. The birthday party. Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal. How was the party? Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers. I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it. Then what? What?! She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood. Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?! It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world. Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs? It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood. Cherry. What are you doing? Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet. How old is Anna? You're the only one in the family who still talks to me. Is it because of Anna? When can I see her? How is she? You find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I'll happily move out of this crap neighborhood. Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet? One hundred and twenty feet. I like the noise. Something wrong with that? K through sixth. I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself. Beautiful. How's business? No shit. Yeah, you still with Northland? Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now. Seems like the whole world's gotten younger. I told her all my relatives are good- looking. Don't need to think fast to handle beer. You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. It means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. Most people only notice birds with the brightest colors. Well... not in the common way. A pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends. Don't you have friends? What are you writing in that book? Not yet. It's good to listen to your daddy. Do you come here often? Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly. Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher. You live around here? That was terrific. I'd love to hear it. I bet you can. Try. How does it sound? A solitary vireo. I like that one. It's just a city park. You always carry these? The mother sure has her hands full. Why not? Is that right? Sure. In that birch tree is a nest. Birds. 'Fraid not. I count my blessings. Yes. It's a free country, isn't it? You're a cop. Figure it out. I have a passionate girlfriend. I suppose if you're looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. Probably not too many men fit that bill. You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though. I wasn't feeling well. I went to bed around seven. You said last night. I went to bed pretty early. I was asleep. No. Know what? The girl. You knew her? Little Red Riding Hood. I don't know. Woodsman? No. Fairy tales? Yes. I fell asleep. You going to take me on a nature walk? They grow outside, don't they? What? Okay. You can't talk to me like -- It's not for sale. Yeah. If you could, you would have brought one today. Doesn't everybody? I would. I haven't broken any laws. Why don't you just tell me? I have no idea. What's up? Cop. You are in. Yeah. It gives me headaches. Apartment's okay. I'm adjusting okay. It's getting dark. Go home. You should go home. No. Yes? Robin, listen to me. I know because... it's just something I know. Your daddy will always love you. Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like. You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you. Yes you can, Robin. Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does. What's her name? Do you like it when he asks you? Does he? They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark. I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there? That's okay... doesn't matter. Are you sure? Would you like to sit on my lap? Would you like to sit on my lap? Robin? Banished... yeah. A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone. No. Walter. No you're not. Can I ask how old you are? I feel... okay. Time. She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to... I smelled her hair. That's it. I just liked smelling her hair. It was a small house. I was six years old! Yes. That's all. I just liked smelling her hair. Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up! I smelled her hair. This is garbage! Nothing. I don't like nobody behind my back! Don't ever do that again. I want you back in your chair! Right now! What the hell are you doing there? Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen? Just lying there. We're taking a nap. I'm maybe about six... which would make her four. We're little kids. In my bed too. In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think? In my bedroom, sleeping. Not so fast. I see my sister. I don't see -- Nothing. Can I open my eyes? Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen. Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me? I'm relaxed. Why? What? That's my answer. I don't know. You mean my problem? I said I was sorry. Sorry. Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away. That's my idea of being normal. Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was? I want to talk about it now. Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you! You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing. I don't know! I don't know. I don't know. You don't know! Fuck you, Rosen! I want to be normal! What is your idea of being a Jew? How do they know? Then how do you know if your patients are getting better? How do you define it? Do you know what "normal" is? You couldn't say. Will I ever be normal? I mean, when will I be normal. How long is this going to take? Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round. You know why. It's part of the parole deal. If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here? I'm not that crazy. I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer. Have to talk about something. She was born after they put me away. How can I have feelings? I don't feel anything. I don't need someone else. Rosen? I don't have a problem with that. Forget it. Honest? Your cheery personality makes my skin itch. Honest? No. It's okay. I'm still thinking about it. No fucking way. How's that? You think reflection is good. Reflect. Bad idea. Of course. Ev-i-dence. Diaries have sent too many guys to prison. No way. A diary? What? It's all the same. It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen. That was a joke. I'm not running for Mr. Popularity. I said the job is okay. The job's okay. I heard they were filthy birds. Yeah. I need a shower. I didn't sleep well. Nothing. Why's it always my fucking problem? Sneak up behind me like that. Don't do that. I'm not scared. Thank you. I don't need a plant. What's this? I say we call it quits. That's not what I meant. Most people don't have my kind of problems. I've got problems. I don't even know how to live with myself. It's a bad idea. Live together. Maybe you should be. I'm not scared. Us seeing each other. Maybe this isn't a good idea. Not ever? You never asked them about it? No you don't. You must hate your brothers. Which brother did this? Why not tell me now? For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me. The percentages -- Most people say the odds are against me. Being here, with me. You know, this is crazy. Nothing. It's over. No. That's what I used to tell myself. I was always the one seduced. Their power. They seduce me. I've changed. Sounds like a special guy. Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that. No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time. You don't really -- No. Never again. Depraved? My mistake. Get your kicks somewhere else. You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit? Why don't you just go now, okay? The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty. I never hurt them. Never. Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were. It's not what you think. Sorry. Look, you can go now. Twelve years in prison is no joke. Yeah. I molested little girls. Yeah. What's the worst thing you ever did? Why do you want to know? Hi. When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming. I suffer from insomnia. What for? The morning? Maybe later. It's been a while since... You think I have a problem? Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole! Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole. You're still here. So, you're not a dyke. What? Why do you want to know? I get that impression. Yeah? What? They could eat you. What about bears? You must hate it. I like the noise. K through sixth. Sorry. I'll buy a plant. What? Are you? I thought you were a dyke. Neither do you. I'm just quiet. Most women wouldn't choose it. No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard. People without cars. Me? What picture? I'm all right. Are you okay?I lied. We'll hunt him down together... You're serious? You'd help me... This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to... Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very... This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster.. Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff. I still can't get over it. I still can't believe you're Catwoman.. You're telling the truth. I can tell..How did this.. What did you say? Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down... Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you. Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now.. Selina, did you make it home, all right? I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means.. Are you sure? This is insane. Let the heroes handle it. I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit... What's the matter? What are you saying? What little boy doesn't... My God...it's, it's...Catwoman. So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh. I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women... You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one.. Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace? What did you think? There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if.. Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there? By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan. I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you? I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff." What's the matter... Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday.. Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men. You say that like an amnesia victim. No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story.. He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes... I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero? I've been looking for you. Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader. It may be time to get the police involved... Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay. My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world? You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart. You're kidding. Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason? Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going... She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she? She has a real spirit. They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle... Oh, how long have you had your own route? Oh come on, Cactus, be a man! The blimp is still on schedule, right? Wha-at? Just hold on! I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..! Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything? Blink once for yes, twice for.. Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right? You've lost all motor functions. The poison will kill you in ten minutes. The "skylight?" Fool! It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight... Don't you realize there's nothing you can do, anyway! Nine minutes and it's all over! The Fun Palace is a tomb. No one can get out. And choke on this furball: all doors and windows are blocked, locked, and electrified! Even the glass around the bomb is rigged. Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook? Will you please stop fighting? Just let those people die so we can get on with our new lives together! Trust me, one day we'll look back on this day and laugh. You got to admit, it's a lot more fun to be the villain. You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie. I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a.. I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it! I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together. We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that... My dog! What do you want from me? I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one! What do you think you're doing?What little boy doesn't? But then we knew that all along, didn't we... I've been looking for you. I can. That's not an admission of guilt, It's just..I knew you had it in you... Did you ever think that maybe neither of us is Captain God? We're waiting. Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to.. But it's true! You can call him yourself. Selina, are you okay? I better go report this in... I suppose she does. A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think? Selina Kyle...lovely person. Women, huh? Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect? I just love risking electrocution every time I.. There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times. We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina? Okay. Let's get serious. Of course I know the Cult of Good is not good. Ever since I saw what they did in Atlanta, it has been my mission to expose them. I've followed them to Oasisburg and soon will have enough hard evidence to bring them to real justice. That computer disc could be the final piece to the puzzle. This isn't just a story, Selina--another damn Pulitzer--this is my life. Not too cool... Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions. Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina? Selina? Uh-huh.. You can't figure me out. You're the strange one.. You're scaring me, Selina. Do it some more. I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could... I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect." I can't believe he ordered white wine. You do know white wine is not real wine... I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say? About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender. Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night? What? Actually, yes. Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason... What did--? I thought you'd like a ride to work. You don't own a cat, do you? No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of.. Good morning. Ah! Ah!--God no, don't tell me you're one of those women who are attracted to ruggedly handsome and brilliant architects.. I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight... Oh the hand--my grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender and..You know, I realize I've never officially introduced myself...I'm Lewis Lane. Oh now this one is mine... How much? Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging.. Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster. I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad.. What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot. A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg. Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up. Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..Yeah. Why don't we? Seems like it. Don't worry. She's yours. What are we waiting on? That's how it is. You see her approaching you toss out installment one. I'm opening the side door. She'll step out. But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view. If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back. And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van. And then? And not a nickel. Negative. Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter. Her husband said there'd be one million eight. So nine hundred to you. You should've done all this before. It's in the process. We're waiting on you. We're waiting for the light to cross the highway. It just changed. We're in a grey van. It reads " Noble Carpet Cleaners ." I don't know what you mean. Satisfied? Talk to the man. You'll see her. Just relax. It's your call. Stay there. We don't see you. You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular. 308-9962. Sure. She's somewhat damaged in the shipping. But nothing makeup won't cover. Some loyalty. We can be there. What time frame have you got in mind? Pass. Where do we meet? There are no guarantees in this life. Keep talking. You're up on your details, aren't you? You got time on your side. Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass. Whatever you say. Twenty percent. Who are you working for?I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place. Get this door open! No reason to kill innocent bystanders. Shit. I can't hardly move my neck. You could've killed us. Give me 20 minutes at least. I was worried about you. Both of you. I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic. Are you there yet? There's a taxi stand here. I can meet you. Don't fuck around. Pop a cap in him. We'll toss it when we make the blind curve. What am I supposed to do? I thought you said you could handle him. Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend. Nobody can do anything right but you! Them. They won't be expecting us. Stay put! I know my way around. Are you busting my chops or what? In your dreams. None of your business, but it's in the cab. That's all mine. When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty. I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards. How do you know? And make ourselves a hell of a target. Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco. It'll be a narrow winding road. You can't miss the house. It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake. Five minutes. In the hills above Sunset. Just below the Getty. Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds. I may need to pry that information out of her. What do you stand to gain? I can see the benefit in that. That bitch. What's keeping you from taking off? Why would she want me to think you were on ice? What does it take to kill you? Who's this? Yeah? I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego. And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life! You want us to get ourselves killed? There's two police cars now. The fuck I will! And if you ditch us we get zilch. If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask. Call me "Nels." What's he doing? Answer me!I would appreciate a little space. Thank you. I know. But it's an emergency. Somebody dying. Okay? Any place. Hey Buddy! Can you let me pull over? Give me some space to pull over. I'm sorry. You'll do all right without me. Keep my share. Then whose is it? Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line. This Mercedes of yours, what's it look like? Did you have to tell her my name? She can't! It's busted. Now hand that on back! I know where it is. Give me that phone back. How was I in the wrong? I'm trying to help somebody. Okay? Say something ... I didn't hurt you. You could've made me lose my call. I'll explain later. I'm sort of on hold. I want the gun emptied. I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out. That's all. OUT ! I'm the one they'd be looking for. Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation? Yeah, I suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die. Particularly if you're not expecting it. You don't know what hit you. Bear right till the fire road ends. It's not far. You missed. Or relieve me of it later. Nels reporting in. Sit down where you are. Arms folded. You got it wrong. I'm the one that's on your side. See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury. On the job. I'm going to level with you officer. What'd you do? Tail me from Brentwood? I got to get going. An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes. Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I. What do you keep making me out to be? Satisfied, Wiseass? It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there. I improved on the fucking original. Go ahead then. I'm covering the receiver. She can't hear. That's illegal. You want us pulled over? I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up. And stop with the directions. If you know that just back off. I don't like anybody laying their hands on me. That's what I deserve for listening in the first place. Will you relax? This in no way affects our business. Go on. Wait! I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again. Bullshit. Not this minute. It's taken care of. Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you. I don't want it. Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man. Toss them -- one at a time. I don't want to lose count. It's going to be some fucking snowstorm. Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per? Know what else is in here? Exactly who was this Oberfeld? Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me. Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again. No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you. Nothing but CDs in there. I thought maybe you'd like some Celine or Whitney. I'm handling it. That's how it's going to be. I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house. It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone. Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us. Naturally. Which one of us is elected to do the deed? What's your point? That's a reasonable possibility. What's really on your wicked little mind? How about "later?" Yeah, I was waiting for that suggestion. You've had a lot of fun with me today. What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call? Who'd ever think, to look at you? I need a break. I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you. Developer ran out of money years back. I'd hate to think about what's living in there. I had it in my mind what you'd look like. "Her," I could've painted. You , I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors. That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas. I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me. I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen. We cleared some of these same roads. Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed. What's happening? That's why we're turning off onto a fire road. Ask them. Dial him up. We need him to run interference. What's Nels' number? It could be a fire. This is Malibu. Let me talk to him. Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me. Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you. We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are. In case I ever need to roll over on somebody. Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return. All parts intact. Then scream for me. A repeat performance. Let me see how easy you can turn it on. Scream! I want to hear you scream for me! Yes I would. Not kill you. But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution. It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish -- Only in the leg or the thigh. You'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts. Now you're starting to sound like a victim again. You're enjoying this too much. I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims. You were at the Emerald that night? You, I would've noticed. What's that supposed to me? Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good. That's on their head. All I did I was put him there. Granted, the cops are not an alternative. Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk. I'm not trying to lose them. Nor am I exceeding any speed limits. Absolutely. And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall. We might hit a bump and the gun might go off. Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident? Not all. They already have a third. The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back? Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it. I probably killed some poor bastard for it. Assure them that you're being well treated. Your friends are probably still on the line. Pick it up and say hello. L.A.P.D. You knew about me. Why pick me to be your "mark?" There was no cop involved. Oh shit! Fuck! And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop -- I got what I fucking deserved. I had it all. I could've kept going! You timed that beautifully. At least one. Damned if I know. The guy with the transplant. Whose money is this? You're not Lenore Oberfeld. Why are you telling him that. Are you crazy? For Christ sakes don't point it at me. We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece. I'm waiting for the girl. Her mother wants to talk to her. Somehow I got along better with you on the phone. It's all there isn't it? So far they're keeping their part of it. We've almost got your husband and your daughter out. So don't get any ideas. Because a lot of people would've gotten killed. Probably all the wrong ones. Now I have -- it's a long story. Include me in that. She'll be with you soon. They're pulling up. They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain. Shit. I'm sorry. Just start walking. Come on. Walk to me. Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us. She's a child. She might panic. She doesn't know me. She might not come to me. She might just run. They won't allow that. It's one at a time. And you have to be first. Can you walk? Don't start thinking about it. Is the tape off? She's next. In two or three more minutes she'll be free. Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions. We're almost there. Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me. Put the man back on. Now you're going to do just what I tell you to. No discussion. No hesitation. You're all three of you in that van? Your husband? That's coming off. How about the girl? Are you okay? I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying. And I'm in a position to negotiate. What about your husband and your child? I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy. Lucky for them they didn't. Hi Lenore. It's me. I got you back. Courtesy of Star 69. Are you hurt? Try what you did before. It worked before. I won't talk anymore. Don't panic. I might be wrong. Hello? I guess I was wrong. Or somebody else there is listening in -- Did you hear that click? Did you jiggle the phone? You can't give up. Why tell me this? I've got a lot of respect for you too. For the way you feel about your family. Yeah, sure that's me. Ask anybody. It won't be him. I might still get there first. The lights are with me. How would I identify the guy who shows up at the bank? What's going on? How come everybody turns out to be a crook? You're doing what you can. Why's all this money stashed? I'm pretty good at signatures myself. They've still got to be able to sign his name. They'll recognize it's not your husband. Do you know what's in that box? Not a chance. I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood. That bank is our best bet. If anybody shows up I could follow them. Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here. I'm not doing too well. What's the matter? Black Mercedes, 600S. Wait just a minute. Our luck has changed. What bank? You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box? I should've put them out of the car and come sooner! He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him. I'm trying to. She's gone -- I've got to ask somebody. Does she wear glasses? Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail? Great. Stay with me. There must be a hundred kids out here. Lenore, I'm here. I'm getting out. I'm making my turn. I see the school up ahead. There are cables overhead. Hang on. It'll clear up. That makes two of us. I'm about ten blocks from the school. A price on everything. Shit, stop with the money! I never asked for a nickel. I was just doing this. And you have to fuck it up with a price tag. Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary. They say my work is somewhat derivative. Pictures. Sometimes I paint. Well you did. I sure as hell got my wish. She doesn't exist. So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all. It never healed. I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her. "Click." You don't exist. Hey drop it, okay? I don't know. I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of. I don't know. 80 or 90 minutes, tops. Where's the fucking recharger cord? Must be in her car, dammit. I'm not looking to get myself killed. I just hope the battery on this phone holds out. Tell me what she looks like. What do you think I'm doing? I'm on my way to the school like you wanted. I kind of dropped them off. They were getting on my nerves. Hello? It's just me and you again. Another minute. Just hang on. I've got a life of my own. Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me. Forget who I am. Where's this school located? He's right? Look, don't try to put blood on my hands. You've got one hell of a nerve siding with him! Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go. Bottom line! There's nothing I can do for you but tip the cops. What do they need her for? Stop throwing names at me. I'm with two friends now. Don't move around. You don't want to puncture a lung. I'm fine. She's back on. Hello? I'm here. I can't stay on this line. I'm picking people up. I'm already overdue. Hello? Fine, no tunnel. Are you still with me? Hello? Shit! I'm in traffic. There's no place to turn. Listen, there's an overpass coming up. I may lose you for a minute. Oh man. These people mean business. Who? What makes you say that? The cops could trace this call back to you. Okay. The police are gonna need your full name and address. Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone? Where'd they take you to? Why would anybody want to hurt you? Don't lay this on me! Oh won't I? I am not involved. Keep clicking your little wires. You'll get someone else. Good luck. Don't expect me to tell you who I am. I don't want to know -- You're the one who's not to be believed. You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care. Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life. This has gotta be some "put-on," right? Sure. And they left you upstairs to make phone calls? Who smashed the phone? What'd you do! Just pick my number out of the air? Lady, try making some sense. And what're you whispering for? No. You don't understand! You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates. And I've got no time to screw around. If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying -- Do I know you? I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day. Didn't we play this scene before? Who is this? What are you planning to do when they got here? They'll kill us. They'll kill Rachel. Put the girl on. Next I want to see Rachel. Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do. Keep her calm. Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car. Count it. I'm backing up. Stop the crying. I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she? Are you trying to panic the women? I won't let 'em. You pull up -- collect your first installment. Then you let the daughter go. When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third. Same action. I back up again -- you pull forward. Satisfy yourself it's there. Then we do it one last time. The final exchange. And we go our separate ways. Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom. You'll still have the girl and the husband. Thanks for the sound advice. Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here. Alone. My pleasure -- I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio. I make my end of the cash at 184,000. Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds. What the face value is. Then just wait. I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady. And her little girl. I still don't see you. You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work. I don't want to see her later. I want to hear her now . I don't need to relax. The woman. Put her on. Fucking "A" it is! Any argument and I'm out of here. I don't want you within two hundred feet. Park down by the lifeguard station. Nobody gets out. I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand. I'm here. Where are you? I wish it had never been invented. Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot. Take my number. When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange. It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back. Got a phone in that van? Tell the lady to relax. Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person. There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass. I want you all in one vehicle. Your van. If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances. You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got. It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from? A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide. Temescal Canyon parking lot. It's a nice day. How about the beach? Granted. But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures. You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you. You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison. He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence. They saw you kill the driver. You're making it too easy. Fine. I want half. Plus the release of the family. I'm self employed. What kind of cut did the hairy one have? I'm in awe. Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away. In which case you just warned them. Who were you talking to? Somebody better tear this down before it falls down. Don't underestimate me. I've got original ideas of my own. Warhol got famous doing a soup can. What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics? Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come. Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels. You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts. At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me. Where's the backpack? Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them. Believe me. They couldn't be busier at the moment. We're gonna get there first. Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together. Where do I turn? How far off are you? Take the 405 south. Sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end. You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack. My compensation! Somebody still owes me -- big time! Intelligent question, Nels. I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity. I suppose you're in your taxi? I thought you'd know me by now. Nels! Guess who? A friendly voice from beyond the grave. You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels. Yeah? Then you can sue the cops. Collect from both ends. Tighten your belts. Here it comes. Ready? From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman. There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you. Tailgate me. I'll jam on the brakes. You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off. You researched me. You know where I live. She'll be waiting for you there along with your split. It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying. Tell the man. You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked. Sure, I end up with some cash. And a lot of bonds I don't know how to dispose of. If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here. I think I've already had a "quickie." Thank you. Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about. I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests. Who am I talking to? Better reassure him. Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak. Why are you picking on me for? Something was rattling around. Some loose tools. Seems not. Since when did you guys start changing tires? If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about. If you've already killed her that's fine. I'll keep the bonds and the cash. We got nothing to discuss. Let me talk to the lady again. Don't be afraid to say hello. Your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase. So I've taken on the task. From here on, I dish it out. Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation. Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up? Your partners are currently armed and we're not. Our edge is that they don't know we're in touch. Undercover. Very official. 259-7881, if I recall. Can I make a quick call? You've got a phone ?I know the answer. I know all there is to know about Louis. Lay it on me. One more thing. If by some chance I get this wrong...tell Dmitri I'm sorry. How do I know you'll keep your word? What kind of question? And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy. You know Dmitri? The crowd was most kind. I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964. That was the moment of my conception. Right here in this very room. Most vividly. "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..." ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog. Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played. So Pops, he just waves me right up. My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes. Oh, my, yes. Did better'n that. Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence. Louis was playing. God was smiling. He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show. After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk. That's how he was, you see. Never forgot where he came from. Money and fame an' all that? Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn. So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing. Right through those doors. The man himself. ...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place. Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point. Being around the music, that was the thing. And I was. Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in? Mr. Louis Armstrong.Yes! Stay put, goddamn it! Don't move from that spot... He doesn't know you're up there! Just stay right where you are! Call the police! Where are you, what floor? ...he's two floors below you. No, no, wait ... It doesn't matter! Just get out of the goddamn building... Dmitri hired him! He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you! He was stalking you when I dropped you off. I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead. Kill you! He's coming to kill you! Listen to me! Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you! Max, the cab driver! Annie...it's Max. Sure thing. Yes, you could. I think you need it more than I do. It'll help. I promise. Dozen times a day. Soon. But I take little ones all the time. Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. Not in a cab... I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together... You need a vacation. But not now? You never answered my question. You like what you do? Big case? ...Bottega. Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer. You? Definitely Clarence Darrow. Sure. I'm starting an 800 hotline. Caught part of your phone call. And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega... You like being a lawyer? Travel...and things. This? Temporary. To pay the bills and save. I got plans... There were two of us. I had the other guy killed. Don't need the competition... It's no big deal. Keep it. Go wild. Have a party. Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone. Let me guess. Clarinet? You like Bach? No. I got lucky with the lights. The ride is free. But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want. First Friday of the month? Linens. Roll right off the trucks. They're in and out in twenty minutes... ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago. Traffic will be smooth. The Bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges. Sixth is faster. I'll take Sixth. It's faster. Hi ya' doin'? Where to? I'm...fine. Fine. Come on, it's been a long, shitty day. How about a break? I'll call a tow truck myself, I swear. I won't budge from this spot. I was heading back to my garage. It's on the way. Comin' over Coldwater. Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me. You believe that? Yes. By the way. Daniel said he was sorry. Hell, make it fifty. Same goes for any business we have in the future. As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight. Twenty five percent. Wouldn't dream of it. In fifteen years, I have never left a customer unsatisfied. The fat man on Cherry Street. The other fat man, Mr. Bulldozer. The trumpet player. That leaves two. You think I wanted to come here tonight? You think I'm that stupid? Sometimes shit happens, you gotta roll with it. You tell me. I had to toss the list in the river. I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass. So why don't you show a little courtesy? I picked up a tail. I said. Get the gun. Out. Of my fucking face. Before I wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you. I think... ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face. I think... Can't say that I do. I'm sorry. I came to see you, you look fine. We gotta go. I'm standing right here. I'm...in...the...room, here. Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room. Mom, Vincent. Vincent, my mother, Ida Rilke. He paid for 'em. You're gonna cheer up. I brought you flowers. I got caught up at work. Hi, Ma. ...oh God, don't shoot me... My hands are taped to the fucking steering wheel! You're kidding me. I got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there's this guy, he taped me in the car, he's back there somewhere. Oh. Oh, thank God, hey! Hey, guys, hey, help me out here! Yeah? It got crashed! I didn't... Yeah? So? Uh, yeah? Lenny? It's me. He'll keep calling. Let her go. Was your seatbelt fastened, honey? Vincent? What are you gonna do, pull the trigger? Kill us? Go ahead, man! Shoot ...my ass. But you know what? Nothing matters, anyway. We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat. Right? Yeah. That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro. And I never saw it that way... I should have done that. Fixed it and more. Get out from under what I been under... 'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves... None of your business. Answer the question. Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said: "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you... 'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone... To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life... Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.? Open your eyes in the morning? I don't think you do...I don't think so... I think you are way low ...like in your estimation. In your estimation of yourself. So how'd you get that way...? What happened to you? Then what are you? That's the reason? What'd they do? That's what you said... You're full of shit. Whyn't you kill me and find another cab. One more. What's at Union Station? Some living. Yeah, so, what's wrong with that? No, not just that. That cop! Why'd you have to do that? You couldn't wound him? The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me... You had to kill Heller?! I only owe you a ride, Vincent. I don't know. Who? Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner. Twelve minutes. Makes two of us. Paid sick leave? You get benefits? In case he asks. How long have you been a hit man? Vincent. Don't make me do this. Don't make me get people killed. I...I wasn't thinking. I just did it. No. No way. I can't do this. He's gonna shoot me? Why me? Why don't you do it? I don't get it. Dmitri? In case who checks? Why? Doesn't cover everything. See, I've got bills. My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid. I told you I don't like to talk about it. I've always been good. Ever since I started. Gave up piano. Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started. Go figure it all out... It's not bullshit. I'm sorry. What happened? Yeah? What happened? Fuck! Nothing's ever goddamn good enough! It's always been that way. She hears what she wants to hear, okay? Don't start. Jazz. You'd do her a favor. Mom, Vincent's not interested. There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother! What difference does it make? She's in the hospital. Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay? Sure? Like you didn't play him? String him along? If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go? I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this! I don't wanna know you! Leave me alone. I'm done. Find another cab. No. You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow. You like the man, you like the way he plays. How about a little jazz, huh? Let him go, Vincent. I'm not catching a melody. That what we're doing? Flowing? I never learned jazz. I listen to classical. I'm...what? Sorry? Am I collateral? Vincent? I don't understand... What? Yeah. Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass. Lenny? You're an asshole. I need the job. I can't do that. He's the Man. He'll fire my ass. It was an accident. I'm not liable. Lenny, my dispatcher. Why? I'll deal with it. I will, I will... I'll talk to them, I'll talk to them. I can't believe this. Please. Don't do anything. How? Oh, it's okay, then. 'Cause you're just taking out the garbage... I don't know any Rwandans. Rwanda-Burundi. Central Africa. Who was he? How can you kill him like that? What'd he do to you? I Ching? You threw a man out a window! Music. Yes. You don't understand. I mean it. Really. I'm not up for this... Listen. I'm not trying to piss you off, see? Okay? I can't drive you around so you can murder folks. You said you were visiting friends! Oh. Oh, no. You're kidding. We... South Central. It's a mess. I think so. What? Okay, try it now. The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor... I tried it. It's not me, it's the engine! A fat guy fell on it from six floors up! Yes! I'm trying, I swear! It's not me. I'm trying... Uh, look...why don't you just take the car... His hand moved! His goddamn hand twitched! Yeah. I don't think I can do this. The trunk? With what? I'm cool. You're cool. You - you killed him? I think he's dead. Yeah, yeah. Shit, man. Guy fell on my motherfucking cab. He fell on my cab! From up th-th-there. Max. Two, two-fifty. I'm not a hire car. It's against regs? Yeah. Lucky with the lights. I don't talk about it, you know... No offense. Twelve years. But I'm working on other stuff... Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking. This job's a fill-in. Me, specifically? It's not that kind of job. You mean like benefits? People are more relaxed. Less stress, less traffic, better tips. Yeah. I share it with the dayshift guy. I see your point. It's home. First time in New York? An apology. Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge. Eleven to get downtown. Four to the Lower East Side. Six to clear the roadwork. One minute margin for error. My math says twenty-four. Twenty-four minutes. Yeah, yeah, sorry... Oh. Sorry.Then let's have it. It's simple. What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument? Of course. I never lie. Ask Max. Max, have I lied yet? Jazz question. What other kind is there? You get it right, we roll with it. You disappear. Tonight. You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again. I am a nice guy, Daniel. With a job to do. You know how it is. 'Fraid so. The crowd had to dig it. Remember what you played? Unbelievable... ...you hearing this? Unbelievable. Get outta here! You and Louis? No. You heard Armstrong play live. I've never been this jealous. You get to talk to him? Was it great? Better than great, it had to be... Jesus... You're kidding me. Of course! I'm in town for a short time. Vincent... Quite an achievement... I'm sure you're very proud of Max. Client? I like to think of myself as more of a friend. A mentor. Tell me about it. It's nothing. I was with Max when he got the call. Happy to meet you, Mrs. Rilke. No harm done, ma'am. Hang on. Carefully... We're gay lovers, what's it to you? Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney... You hassling my driver again? Jesus, what is with this guy? Tell it to Max. Tell him he's an asshole. How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick? Vincent Farrell , Assistant U.S. Attorney. A passenger in this taxicab, and I'm reporting you to the DMV... He's not paying you one cent! What happens if you don't? Max? Well. That was brilliant. Slow down! Slow the hell down! You're going too fast. Slow down. ...pie in the sky? "Someday my dream'll come..." But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old. It hasn't happened. It never will. Life just flipped on you. Tomorrow became yesterday. Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life... Don't talk to me about murder. You're do-in ' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday... Look in the mirror. ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros. How much you got saved? ...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision... As in...? Get with it. Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us. Lost in space. The universe doesn't care. The cop, you, me? Who notices? ...indifferent. That's the "why." That's the why? There is no reason. No good reason; no bad reason. To live or to die. How do I know? But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me. Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted... I dunno. And you believe me...? I'm full of shit? You're a monument of bullshit. You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage. Bad guys killing bad guys... You're too good. We're in this together. Fates intertwined. Cosmic coincidence and all that crap... There you go...! How are you at math? I was hired for five hits. I did four. Head towards Union Station. It's what I do for a living. Yeah, that. I shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you? Who's Heller? Good. Blood, urine and death get to you? Try deep breathing. Or remember we all die anyway... It's not what you owe me. Time is so fleeting. One day it's gone. You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her. That's what I think. What holds you back, Max? Tell me. Why does life scare you so much? Your lady friend. The one who gave you her business card. Think she was just being polite? Would you have called her? You do impress me, Max. That you do. Washington and Holt. Dance club called "Fever." Know it? Damn, Max. I'm impressed. Really. I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there. You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off. Quit stalling and get out of the cab. No. Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin." Why? We've both run out of options. If it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice. That's jazz, my friend. You said it yourself. So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes. Max. You threw my briefcase in the river. You've got balls bigger than Toledo. When he finds out you tossed his list? I would. No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way. Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it. You're gonna be me. You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits. The man who hired me for this contract. Our friends in Little Russia. Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri. I'll just hold onto it for you. In case they check. Gimme your wallet. Good excuse. How many others you got? What, no insurance? Well, this big stake's got to be big by now. When you leaving? Yeah? Like what? Limos? What do you call it? Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me. I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do. Don't be. I never saw him after I was 15. Went into the military early. So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit. I killed him. When I was 15. He was my first. Nah, wishful thinking. Liver cancer. He hated everything I did. Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily... It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you... I had a father like that. Maybe so. Maybe she hears what you tell her. Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother. Limos, huh? What the fuck was that? You take one more step, I'll kill her. Oh, I'm captivated. Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention. That's bad. And that's not good... You go every night? Show up for what? Show up for what? Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop. I'm not playing. Pull your head out of your ass. Get your thinking straight. You wanna die? Don't even think you're walking away from me. Max? What are you doing? What you mean, no? Let's go. Jazz? That's funny, coming from you. Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this? I'll ask a question. You mind? I'm working here. That's the point. You play between the notes, you dance around the structure, you improvise. Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now. Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over. That's not living. That's dying a little every day. Not me, pal. It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living. That's jazz. That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about. Hell, it's the same thing he's talking about, if you just open your ears. You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet... Damn right. Instinct, man. If you think too much, it doesn't work. Just listen... God, are you always this prosaic? You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're taught. It's like breathing, like life. Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow. ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening. Awesome. What do you think? Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central. Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop. Bird. Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk. Chet Baker. I'll buy you a drink. Expand your horizons... Jazz. Music. But, hey, some good news. This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill. Jazz? You like jazz? Yes, Max? People in the wrong place at the wrong time. Draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work. And for you? You attract attention, you're gonna get people killed who don't need to be. Collateral damage. Another collateral. I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes. Where's the button? Under the dash? Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass. No you don't. So what? Don't take that. Tell him to shut the fuck up. It was an accident. You're not liable. Tell him. Who's that? Because I have a gun and I say so. Hands on the wheel. Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed. That one's probably married. Think of his kids. His wife's pregnant... Good luck. You think they got families? Believe it. Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space. You're a cabby. Like talk yourself out of a ticket? Get rid of 'em. Yeah, like that... But, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive. Even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat. Everybody dies. You don't know the guy in the trunk, either. If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise. Tens of thousands killed before sundown. Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Did you bat an eye, Max? Join Amnesty International? No. I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit... What do you care? Ever hear of Rwanda? I should only kill people after I get to know 'em? Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy? Nothing. I only met him the one time. I didn't throw him, he fell. Chopin prelude. Stodgy, but nice. Here's the deal. I didn't want you involved in this. Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max. Improvise. Life is that way. Adapt to your environment. Survive. Darwin. "Shit happens." The I Ching. Whatever. Roll with it. Play music. What else calms you down? Candy? Cigarettes? Sex? Breathe. Are you breathing? Tonight it is. They're somebody's friends... You drive a cab. I kill people. We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead. I told you we had other stops to make tonight. How long, you figure? 58th and Central. You know it? So? What are you doing? You better? Adrenaline's wearing off. You get shaky after. It's not uncommon. Deep breathing helps. Try some deep breathing. I'm making you nervous. I'm the one with a schedule. How about the thingy next to it? What about that? Two... Try harder. I'm gonna count to three. One... You listening to me? Max. Max. May we leave the scene of the crime now, please. ...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right? Get in the fucking car. It's a spasm! Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl... What? Got it? It's just a dead guy. On three, ready? Uno. Dos. Three. I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs... Did I stutter? The trunk. Unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go... You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX. Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator. So we go to Plan B. Pop the trunk. Good. Help me out here. No. You say you're cool. You cool, Max? Say "I'm cool." No-no, I-I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him. No shit. Since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head... You always stutter? Max? I'm Vincent. We have a deal. What's your name? I'll make it an even five hundred. Plus an extra hundred if you get me to LAX on time. Regulations? These guys don't even give you sick leave. How much you pull down on a good night? Bullshit. You probably know the light schedules, too. Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing. Five stops, one night. I gotta catch a six a.m. flight. I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures. Why don't you hang with me? Twenty-four minutes! Man, you're hot... None taken. There are talkers and doers. I like doers. Like what? Oh? How long you been doing this? Why not? You should start a union. Yeah. Retirement? Paid sick leave? You on some kind of work plan? You prefer nights? You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in. This your regular ride? You share it with over three million people every day. You know that's the population of New Zealand? What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles. Read about this one guy. Gets on the subway and dies. Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that. Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million. That's too damn many people. Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown. Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave. Place gets to me. Too loud, too fast...too much. You like it here? Mind if I time you? What do I get if you're wrong? A free ride? Twenty-four? Not twenty-five? Or twenty-three? How long you think this'll take? Uh, let's go to... Hello...? Hello?I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport Not yet. It's only beginning. The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away. One of your suitors? I thought that was you, up there. At home. I couldn't face all this traffic. Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians. I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident. No. But when he's in that car... He's very pale. Covered with scars. It does. You're not envious? I thought she might come along. Handling a car again might be more tiring than I imagine. Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident. I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant. What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet? You should have gone to the funeral. After being bombarded endlessly by road- safety propaganda, it's almost a relief to have found myself in-an actual accident. It's about time. Have you seen it? What!? They brought the car here? Where's the car? And her husband? What was he? That's going well, then. Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it. I'll listen for you buzzing over. They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting. Thank you. I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen. We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set... Did you come? Where were you? And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents? And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars? Please finish your story. Is this part of the act or are they really hurt? Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash. Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him? Isn't that rather too close...? The Road Research Laboratory? Where they simulate car crashes? Are we imagining it? Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it. So - why the airport? I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them. The airport? Why? Are you leaving? You haven't told me where we're going. Can I give you a lift? I somehow find myself driving again. I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult. It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people... No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan. Hard to say. You're not jealous, are you? You have to understand... Helen and I had this strange, intense... experience together. You're kidding. Really? What kind of exhibition is it? What is it? I can drive. You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love. There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it? No. Where are you? He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood. What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project. It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why. Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash? You could get your wish at any moment. What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic? Do you live here? With Seagrave? Why are the police taking this all so seriously? Yes.But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't. Anybody can see that. What's that, sir? Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses! Make them go faster, Mr.... ? Why? It don't hurt. Well, I thought he'd come in the middle. I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater -- 'N Daniel Webster will be there. And two unpara-- unparalleled Cir-cass-ian beauties? What is that? No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be -- -- a man that eats fire? Gee -- that Fair -- Well, I wouldn't mind. But my name's Daniel Stone. I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you. Mama! No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party. No! No! I won't. It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone! Not me! Grandma, look at me! I did not, Grandma. But I like the new one better. Granny, when do we move to the new house?Who are these people? What are those people doing there? What do they want? Oh -- Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady. Get some wine for the Squire, Belle. Hey, you! Watch out there -- you're scuffing my Brussels carpet -- Consarn them. The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends? We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle. Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning. Let's dance together -- Belle. I'll take it. From over the mountain -- Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ... Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you. Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around. I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me. Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind? Howdy, Hank. Why, thank you, Tom. I was going to ask you if you thought I could. I'll look out for myself! ... Now go away -- leave me alone. What Grange? What do you want? Black Dan'l? I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington. Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights. Sure am. Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens. Belle -- Never mind. What's your name? She couldn't be gone! You're not -- Dorothy. Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me! Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow? All right -- so it's buried with you! Why do you fret about something that isn't there? Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all. Afraid ... of what? What's the matter with you? Almost seven. No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure -- Now run along, Daniel. I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come? No, you're not. Some other time, Stevens. Hello, Stevens ... you're early today. Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad.... You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air. Like that! -- in gold. I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment -- Stevens! You know darn well it is. Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me. Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie. Never! About what? No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now. Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle! Not now! Not now! -- Let me make up -- let me make up. I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything. I'm through with you. My time isn't up yet. Are they all as -- small -- as that? He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there. You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship -- Leave your tongue off of that! I don't care. Look here now-- The seventh day of April -- Well, I'll be -- No, no! Give it to me! What does it mean here -- about my soul? It's mine? Yes, why shouldn't it? Where did it come from? Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But-- Opportunities? You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did. I guess I did. Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster! Well, I -- There's no joy in it for me. Not long -- now. Yes -- at midnight. Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began. It's your fault! You brought Daniel Webster here -- just to try to make a fool of me! You played the sneak behind my back -- made up all sorts of lies against me! You can get yourself out of my home -- go back to the other house -- that old place, where you belong -- I don't want to -- to talk to you again! I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this -- Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything. What -- what's on your mind? Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests! Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary. Thanks, Mr. Webster! To the champion of the whole United States -- Dan'l Webster! Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster. Thank you, Mr. Webster. Ten throws -- Mr. Webster? Shake! How much? Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet? That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster. Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we? Yes siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already. You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come. You think that's a joke? I had him on there too, but I was afraid Dan'l Webster might feel insulted. Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody? Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation? Dan'l Webster is coming to my party. Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret? You really think so? Howdy, Squire! Howdy! Oh -- how do you do, Squire. But -- I was just lucky. Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me? Camomile tea! Headache -- Squire? Mighty good of you to come out, Squire -- sparing all this time to -- Sheriff, too -- and Schoolmaster -- mighty nice. Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks. Why -- good morning, Squire. Shall we? Mary! You must go now, Mary -- you must! Mary! Come back ... Mr. Webster ... Wait! ... Mary! What's the matter with 'em? Why don't they come? Think this room is larger than anything Webster's got at Marshfield? You've been there. What about it, Mary? Why don't they come -- Oh, for heaven's sake, leave me alone! It shows on your face. He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything. Isn't that your own fault? You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary. What happened.... Where are you taking him? What in sugar hill's the matter with him? Well -- I -- I- Mary -- Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest. I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind. And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife. Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it. But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife -- I'm serious. That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary. You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me. Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners! Thanks, Mary. Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on. Mary -- Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground -- Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man. There is nothing to worry about now. Tired? Remember, Mary, how he said it: "Couldn't have done better myself, Jabez Stone," and it was my first speech. I don't know what came into me, Mary. I just stood up and the words came flowing like water out of my mouth. Yes, Mary. It's been a long day. Looks right elegant, Mary. Will you come into town with me tomorrow? Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn. Mary -- what would you do? Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold? I'll get the doctor. Mary -- how do you feel? Mary-- You're right, Mary it's a fine calf. That's why Stevens'll take it for the rest of the payment. Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in. I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that. Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end? To save us work on the spring plowing? If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him. Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse. Mary -- it's gone. Your butter money? Well -- what are we going to do? If it would only move old Miser Stevens -- We've still got to pay him. " ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors? It's Tom Sharp and two other fellers -- Oh, glory -- where's my pants? Well, I'll be -- there's a rig, turning in, by the gate. Hold the splint tighter -- it's almost done. Go on reading, Ma. This man, Job, he had troubles, didn't he? That's what we said. I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first. Yep. I think his leg is broken. You're right, Mary. What is that smile on your face? Is there anything wrong with me? All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants! Down, Shep! Down! Coming. Ma -- Ma -- it's all right, Ma! Ma! ... Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l? I want you to fix these fish! Sure, Ma. Golly, Ma -- Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight. Ma -- is she? -- Make out? We'll do better than that! I never thought I'd be glad for bad luck, but I am. I never thought I'd be glad of a hail storm at harvest time, but I am! Oh, bless ye the works of the Lord in the hail and the storm and the rain! I say -- it don't matter. It don't matter! Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he? I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways -- Do you really think that? Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma? Me -- a son. I feel -- fidgety, Ma -- not right at all. Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else. My son! Do you really think, Ma.... Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs -- Say, Mary, how is your shoulder? But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right. Aren't you glad? Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was. I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing! And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good. Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him... ... up there, just what I think. I dunno. Helps sometimes to say it. Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it! How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma? There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary. But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper. That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma? Hard luck -- like me. Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig -- He won't let me fix him -- Consarn the consarn -- Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum. Come in, Sheriff. Very well, folks. I accept. And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him. Hello, Sheriff. Let him try it. It's all right, Sheriff.I see you! Riding pretty high, ain't you? Look out you don't fall off. Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again? That's just too bad -- Move? -- We are not going to move -- the old one is good enough for us. Of course it's all right, son. You had Daniel Webster, didn't ye? Breakfast's ready! I've made a special surprise for Mr. Webster. Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go-- My son ... what's the matter? And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath! And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...! You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy. Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that. There -- that's what I mean. You'll be a father any minute now. Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out. What's that you say, Son? Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined! A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters. You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him. Wouldn't profit him none. Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference. I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son. Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you. Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States. Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance. It won't be the first baby ever born in this house. There! Made me drop a stitch! Sit down, you make me nervous! Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world. Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again. Well -- that's comforting! Supper. Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell. Don't seem right, somehow! You found it in the barn, hey? Hush up such talk, Jabez! Well ... make him keep quiet. What's ailing that dog? All right, son -- if it helps. That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ... I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills. Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez! Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish. You know that, son. Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word! "There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil." Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there. Ah, fiddlesticks -- you are old enough to know what you are doing. So you've made up your mind to go to the party. What's that? Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all. Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him! She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away! Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing! The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain. Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that? H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians. Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out. Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read. Well, I guess we won't be going to church today. Mary -- Jabez --Gentlemen, the prosecution rests. But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience. Is this your signature? That is highly irrelevant to this case, Your Honor. Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document? Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract? Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind? Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed. I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of -- You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ... Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone -- -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might-- Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose. What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences. Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone? Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary. Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing. In your case -- He was -- .... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance. Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract. Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service? Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste. But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that. But you should, now that you are becoming a father. Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract. Good evening, Neighbor Stone. 1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847. Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date? Excellent. A firm, fair signature. One that will last till doomsday. My dear Neighbor Stone, I congratulate you! You're going to be the richest man in New Hampshire! A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man? Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing-- That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is -- -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years. It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time. Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen. Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn! A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him. Like that! Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county. You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you. You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities -- Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire. My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen. Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A. The quick or the dead! You have said it. May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster! Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury -- You mean -- a jury trial? And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours. Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner? There, Mr. Webster. All open and above-board and in due and legal form. Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now. Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster! Cup for cup -- what do you say? Oh .. not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep. It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it? Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you? Mr. Webster, I presume? Pretty good -- that's perfect! I'll be there, too! With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir. It's only a short drive, Mr. Webster. Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now. Why don't you? You can talk to me ... The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense. My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So -- Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone. You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains. Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West. Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself. No, Daniel -- they are not race horses. They are good old friends of mine. I call 'em Constitution and Bill of Rights, the most dependable pair for long journeys. I've got one called Missouri Compromise, too, and then there's a Supreme Court -- fine, dignified horse, though you do have to push him now and then. It does hurt! And don't you do it again. Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again! And serve him right! And what about Daniel Webster? A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l? Young man -- you got me there. Guess there will, if it says so. It hasn't opened yet? All right, Daniel. Jump in. Hello, Colonel! Want a lift? Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven. I know -- that was mighty queer Medford -- knew it the minute I tasted it. But it takes more than that to down Daniel Webster. You were worried, Jabez, weren't you? Oh, come, man, come. Just because you've sold your soul to the devil that needn't make you a teetotaler. There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip! Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug. They make plucky women in New England. H'm ... how long have we to wait? I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too. It's here you said that you closed the deal with him? No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child. I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too -- They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it. They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more! You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone? That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez? Well -- I'll be -- if it isn't little Mary Sampson from Franklin. Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself -- -- under the circumstances. Thank you. Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land! To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone! Not at all, lad -- not at all. For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim. I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners. You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone? Ten throws it is. Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin? Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you. What are you looking for, Colonel? What's your name? There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma? I'll do my best, Mary. Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady. Are you, Mary? Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way. Party seems to be quite a success. Lots of guests, anyhow. And now come on, Mary. I want to show you the all-fired biggest parsnips in the whole United States, raised right here in Marshfield -- of course! Mary -- you've talked to me as you might have talked to your father and I believe he wants me to help you a little. You see, sometimes we think we're licked in this life -- but we weren't put here to be licked. Don't you believe it. Sometimes the shadows seem to get hold of us -- the shadows and the evil -- but it is still up to us to fight. Now I was thinking before you came, of coming over to Cross Corners end of the month, to get acquainted with my Godson -- and other things. You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself. I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself. Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there? No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs. Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely -- Do you mind if I indulge? Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him. Why, that's different! Well, boys, I guess we'll knock off. I've got to see a friend. If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira -- Hullooo! Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ... I object. I'll drink to that, Mr. Scratch! Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury! I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians. Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client. Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship. H'm. This appears -- I say appears -- to be properly drawn. But you shall not have this man! A man isn't property! Mr. Stone is an American citizen, and no American citizen may be forced into the service of a foreign prince. Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it. Cup for cup! There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. Me? Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name? Say, that's pretty good, young man. I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition. Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju. You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N. Give me it. And four children? How many in your family? Ten thousand francs for each one. How much? You want to pay me? There is nothing to it. They are all Tutsi cockroaches. Where is your family? Do you know how to open the safe there? Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it. You work at the Hotel Diplomat? You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president. Let me see your identity card. We are looking for you. Who are you?We're awaiting a decision, excuse me. Yes we have. Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order. Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role. No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels. I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out. No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now. Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it. The rebels have fought their way into the city. They have many Hutu prisoners. I can't, I don't have the men. That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel. Yes. Where are the Rwandan police? They're only taking the whites. You're fucking black! You're not even a nigger, you're African! They're not staying to stop this thing. They're gonna fly right out of here with their people. Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing. We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless. Congratulations. You should spit in my face. Anything. Strong. They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister. Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them. Paul, I've sent my soldiers to rescue the Lady Prime Minister, she'll need a room. Get him a room, but tell no one he is here. Paul will look after you. Paul, you know who this is?You will tell them the truth. I led no massacres. I committed no war crimes. You lie. I am on a list! What list? How so. We are better here. You cannot go back to the hotel. The crazy men are going there now. Better to come with me. I am going to do you a great favor. I am going to take you with us to Gitarama. Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them. Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think? Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland? You know what the Scottish call it? Today. We have decided to move the government to Gitarama. They can go where they want. They are in charge now. After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back. Get in. I'll be over. Whiskey? You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey? Where are my supplies? You said you had no whiskey. I am strong, Paul, like a lion. I will see what I can do. If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them? He did. The police are very busy. The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders �we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us.� What do you think would have happened? No different. The high command? Our high command? And what will they do with these satellites? Satellites? Watch everything? How? They are gone. What did they say? What did you overhear? The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you. Your cellar is well-stocked, right? As long as it is scotch. Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul. Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please. Paul, this scotch is exceptional.Show us the manager. He wears a suit. One thousand francs. No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards? What cards? What? Show me your ID The commander is not here. What do you want?Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go. No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead. It is dangerous to be here. The radio says this is a nest of cockroaches. No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe. I will see what I can do. No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this. Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.We, who is we? What happened? I'm sorry, it's a private function. Yes, Benedict, what can I do? I'll be back. Of course. Leave it to me. Excuse me? No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis. Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand? Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me. Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here. I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside. I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you. I'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them. Ten. Six. Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines. I don't have that much. Name a price. Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work? Please, I don't use guns. Let me explain. Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here. Of course. I used to work at the Diplomat. No. I work at the Mille Collines. Yes, it is a calamity for us all. What is this about? I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu. Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise. I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day? What is it? Will you protect us. I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away. They fired a rocket at us. Their people? I don't understand. Excuse me, Colonel. Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all. Canadian Club? Where is she? What's happening? Yes sir, but these people they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium? Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance. I will do nothing unless you help me now. You think they will believe you? Who will tell them? You need me to tell how you helped the hotel. The others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. They say you led the massacres. If you do not help me, you will stay on that list. When the Europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists. The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list. You are a marked man. Listen, you need me. I do not want to go to Gitarama, General. Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate. I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now? No, sir. No. When? What do you mean, General? Where are they going? Your police are at the gate? We must go to the Diplomat. Bring back your policemen... The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you. General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies. No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests. I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty. Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio. Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey. I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one. I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness? The front gate would be best, General. �Well rewarded� Those were his words. I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded. I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us. Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily. 'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. Lock them all away forever. No political risk, and big publicity.' That's what he said. I thought I'd better tell you. The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command. Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder. Satellites. The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything. A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel. Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about. The United Nations are still here. I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie. It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know. Let's go. ) You cannot kill them all. What do you mean George? You have no whiskey? I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey. At least. Very good. Time is money, George. We need extra beer today. I will try my best George but these days I have no time for rallies or politics. Thank God. When will they be here? Of course. The fifth room is your broadcast room. Just give me a moment to get your keys. Are you sure this is the river road? Just drive, Gregoire. For supplies, you drive. Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George? Gregoire it is good to see you back to work. I am in charge now. Get back to work or I'll fire you. Get out of this room and get back to work. Gregoire, what are you doing here? Give me the phone. This is a Rolex, I can't take it. I would never do that. This goes out live? I'm afraid I can't do that, Mr. Daglish. I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here. Promoted. House Manager. I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish. Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina. Call, sir? That will take time. The guest list. It hasn't been updated since the murder of the president. I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping. Why sir? Yes, sir. What is wrong? They have him in the lobby, go quickly. How much? You have our cards. Our cards, please. Excuse me. He will be here. We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda. I will give you my house. How do you know? I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins. Was there blood? This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful. I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family. I need a great favor. We can't wait. We all go together or not at all. They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance. Also, this is your bill for the last week. Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms. I'm going to put you on the third floor. I'm afraid you will have to move room. Of course. Anais, it is so good to see you. I have to go to the Diplomat. The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled. We have to. If I do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump. Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there. We have to have a plan. We are almost out of everything. I love you. Keep the children safe. I will follow on the next plane. Go. I cannot leave these people. I will wait for the twins. I have to stay. Get on the truck, Tatiana. We wait until 7:00. If he is not here with the twins he is not coming. We leave. That was your promise. Go help the children. I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise. We have to get out of here Tatiana. A Volkswagen. What does it matter. A car. It was substantial. To be closer. So that I could marry you. I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali. I had you transferred to Kigali. Yes, when you worked as the nurse. I have a confession. When we met... A kiss. It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace. I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants to impress me now. I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide. To Rutagunda's place. It is close by. I have to go out to get food. We're running out of beer and other supplies. Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it. Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef. Do as I say. I will be there soon. Go to the roof now. Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then. What are you saying, Tatsi? I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis. Listen to me woman. I said all the whites are leaving. The French, the Italians, even the Belgian UN soldiers. We have been abandoned. They are being evacuated. No. They are not dead. Stop this. This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they fled or could not make it home. There is hope. Give him time. How can we help him. Has Roger spoken yet? I'll try. Any luck? This won't do. Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them. What! Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore. Get in. Stay with the children. Where are you hurt, son? Dawn. Then they go. They know you are Tutsi! Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them? Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here? I sent them home. Go and call them. Murdered! By whom? Jean Baptiste! Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment. He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us? No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals? I couldn't help. No. Please, be quiet. What? Homework? Let's have dinner first. Thomas wants advice? Your brother's here? Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time? Why? Thank you, sir, you saved our lives. There is one thing I need right away. Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit. What is this about no water? When? Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people. You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here. How much beer? Where has all our beer gone? What are you doing? Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it. Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up. What! Paul storms off. Where are the receptionists? Where's Gregoire? How dead? Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself. Many times. Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates. It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama. You are with me, Zozo, don't worry. What's wrong? The French. They supply the Rwandan army. Yes, thank you Mr. President. Now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. I have ten minutes left. The staff, the guests. I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all. We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel. Where? Who is this Simon? No, I don't want you going on the street. Why the hurry, Roger? Thank you, Roger. Go downstairs, I will help you. What is his room number? Can I help you?
