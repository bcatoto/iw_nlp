Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem! What's the problem? Oh, sod you. Look, do you want the bed in or not?Will you sign for the bed? We're leaving. Want to buy a bed? It's my lucky day. Lucky man. Oh. Got her mother's looks. That your daughter? Do you really need this bed, lady? Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.We've got such sights to show you -- Just in time. We want the man who did this -- Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that? Nobody escapes us. Many times. No time for argument. No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering. He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us. You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures. Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others. It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration. The box... you opened it. We came.That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK. Hush now. It's all right Frank's here. Poor baby. Don't mourn him. He was dead long before we laid a finger on him. Some things have to be endured... Come to Daddy. One last time. Give me the box. I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter... I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful. What? What will you do? What CAN you do? There's nothing to be frightened of. Come to Daddy. You remember. Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank. Kirsty? I need a skin. Then we leave -- Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS? There's very little I can do about it. Maybe. I don't think so. She'll want Larry first. Then find me somebody else, before they come looking. So where's the harm? You can't love him. It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes? They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it. No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible. You would be. They tore me apart. The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free. Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box. Sure. Somewhere safe. Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room. I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth. To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which. Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors. It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle. This is what began it. A long time. Not know. What? Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some? You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse... Ssh. Don't want babe to hear. Poor Larry. Obedient as ever. The Cenobites. It's only a matter of time before they find I've slipped them. I have to get away from here. -- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking. One more. Maybe two -- My nerves... are beginning to work again. I'm hurting The blood brought me this far. I need more of the same. Or I'll slip back... You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't. ...somebody... Just help, will you? Please God, help me -- His blood... on the floor... It brought me back. Believe me. It's me. It's really me. Frank. Help me. I said: don't look. Don't look at me. Julia. Sure you are. Wedded bliss? Forget him. I don't want to see the dress. I don't want to see the dress. Well can I come in or not? There is going to BE a wedding? I came for the wedding. I'm brother Frank. You're Julia, right?You fucking ass-holes. My fucking hand! Christ! Just take it slowly. Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work. Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not? Julia's my second wife. Her mother's dead. Uh-huh. Alright, let's give it another try. It'll go in. He was insane, baby: a mad dog. I put him out of his misery -- What are you talking about? What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Huh? Come with me then. Oh baby. What's wrong with you? No. I'll do it. Only I'll turn it off -- Are you all right? Is this upsetting you? Kirsty. O.K. O.K. Sure. Can I get you anything? Oh, babe... Are you all right? Sweetheart... I've been calling you. Julia? Are you O.K.? Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding. Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company. I'll be scarred for life. So damn stupid. I'm going to throw up. Shit. I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood. I cut myself. How are you doing through there? We'll move in Sunday. Well? He's BEEN here. There's stuff in the kitchen. He must have made a hasty exit. Where are you? I hear you. Oh Christ. Julia... So what's the argument? You wanted to come back to London. We came back. You're still blaming me. You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it. He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors. We'll sell it. Sell everything. I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway. The best part of ten years. It's just been empty a while. Ah! Like who? O.K. O.K. It's ONE of these. Where are you going? No. It's all over. What's the problem? Show her. No you don't. I'm afraid it's true. Poor Frank. He's better off dead. He's gone. Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now. It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right... Of course. Maybe all she needs is some company. Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends. I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me. It's like she's waiting for something. She doesn't even want to leave the house. You don't like her at all do you? I guess. ...maybe we should never have come back. I love you, honey. Never better. You sleep well. Steve? What are you drinking, love? Are you O.K.? Kitchen's through on your left. Kirsty. Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving. I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved. You like? Call me tomorrow. O.K. You will keep in touch. I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us. What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture -- Well come over, will you? See the place? Well I want you to see the house. Do you want me to come over? You'd like the house. I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile? What did you say? Where are you? Kirsty? Who's there?'Bye. I'll come back later, huh? What did I say? What? I won't let anybody take you. What's wrong? What things? What happened to you? It's a fetish of mine. Can I lend you a hand? Are you busy after work ? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you. Your father told me you were working here. Are you alright ? Well you've just been talking to the wrong people. Oh no. We're not all frigid. I beg your pardon? Meaning what? I see. Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room. We walk. If there's a train. Please. I want to see you home. All right? It's late. I thought we'd lost you. Need any help? You're not going? So lie down. We're on the Cointreau.The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we. That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son. Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this. Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes. The sodding water table. And the bride. Here's to music. And absent friends. And I'm still just a lad myself. Don't panic! Keep your head! Bugger the Buffs. I don't understand. Is there any point to it? Except the servicemen. How's your war, Mac? There was talk of planting some when we first came. Why not? What about it? What kind of war is this Mac? Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about. I heard the drum and fife yesterday, Mac, marching past. Made my hair stand on end. I thought, I've been asleep for twenty years. If King and Country call, Mac, you go as soon as I will. Kiss me Hardy. Weeds will grow, Mac. And Jim. ...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat. Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching. Fair enough. The river. Where to? I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt. Not till Christmas, I don't suppose. A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England. I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished. That's it. Taste it. Why don't you taste it? Jam is jam! It's just jam! Well? Well, it's off ration. We know that. Jam. Oh, that. What's that? We all had to write a last letter home. We didn't know that. It was a suicide mission. Machetes against artillery. Volunteers only.Apparently so. You're much more convincing when you're making it up. You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk. Only till they get you into the local school. You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school. Give him the you-know-what. I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil... This is going too far, young man. Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you. Want to know why they're called Faith, Hope, Grace and Charity? You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another. That was a googly! Never let a rat creep up on you. Put your hand on mine, get the knack of it. So it was. Sheila. This boy will go far. What's that? What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn. You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us. And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness. To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson... ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.We will, you will, for the rest of our lives? They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8. Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have. And absent bridegrooms! Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all. So you're going to be a grandfather. I will if you will! You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs. There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time. Naturally. Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else. Propaganda. We've been had. You need trees for an avenue. Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue. Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street. What did we know? We were seventeen. You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot. Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you. Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold. What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter. ....buried In a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs. ...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin. Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship. Look after yourself, Grace. You might still have a house. We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that. We did the decent thing. Clive had a job. I didn't. I couldn't. It's all better left unsaid, Grace. She said, 'I know you love me, Mac, but you've never loved me enough.' A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless. Happy days. When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly. ...since I used to take you to the Proms? Play something, Grace. Grace! It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake. How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite. In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to. Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two..... Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out. I mean it! No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you. I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done. She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong. You're a lucky man. She's in love with you. Anyone can see that. I know it's no good. I've no right to be jealous. Thing is...I think I'm in love with her. Not really. Truth is...I was ..jealous. Of you. She is beautiful. I was wrong. She tried to help us get away. Now, you're too suspicious. Rene? About what? Keep thinking. Gimme a minute. Never mind that, where are we now. Be quiet. Losing power. The laser drained it. What exactly? Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip. This may hurt. And don't let her know, either. GRUNER switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to Chiang Cho. The man we want has the PEM, and is across the border by now. ...Shit! It's just money. Aim just in front of his face. Are you alright? Don't worry, I can. Do it. He didn't. He left us that walkman chip to confuse us. Would have kept most people busy. We were too fast for him. He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back. It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong. While he makes the run. It's not the one...Wait... there's a label. Left...The one with the red dot. Cash. haka xuki. You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman. Just say the words. Just like I told you. Not sure at all. I've got an idea. Plenty of circuits in a Walkman... It's him. I don't trust her. Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind. No. You can't trust her. He was with Gruner! Never mind, just say it. Neither can they. Door to the right. Get up and run. A hard left. A hard left. Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----. You have to! Quickly! Drink lots of water. ...drink it. Don't touch a thing. One of your instincts? Yeah...You've fallen for her. What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through. Relax. Make your mind a blank. Relax. Let me do this. `Joe. I'm here. You're Okay. Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me. Just stay here and rest. That's not funny. Come on, she's getting away. Run, stupid! Follow her. We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself. Fountainhead of High-Tech. Osaka. Better. I found Ryuji. Bingo. Some agent you are. You been had. We have. I...I'll got to the movies. That's what I'll do! You get time off to sleep. And on my time. Shit! You're in love. Is that all? What she say. What'd you get out of her? What Happened? Joe! It's 56 hours! Oh come on. What am I supposed to do? What if she says something important? What is it? You're doing great with her. What is it, your charm? Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know. She's the toughest to read. Voice stress analyzer. They're all in it. Joe, be careful! Don't get too cute. He recognises you, throw him off. It lends you an air of mystery. Just don't show fear. The blond...GRUNER. A killer. Just hold them close and stay still. Follow that busboy. The drinks...Stay on them. Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses. Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved. You're not just after this girl, are you? Get close to them. They both look good to me. Which one is she? Doesn't. What did that cost? Not that tie with that coat. It is my business. It's my name. Much too blue. You really like that shirt? Looks like...the optic nerve. I can see out! Is something glinting? But what's it look like? What are you looking at? But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire. Well you did it today. You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum. It worked. Good thing I'm here to do the thinking. Without your pants. Where are you going? What happened? No...you idiot! Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works. Touch her. Where is she staying? Wait. . Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth. Don't just stand there, say something. What can I do? You're on your own. How should I know? Try another language. What's happening? What is it? You're out of shape. Follow it. What was? What? What do you mean? Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while. For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it! Why not? Eat it. The sand. I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it. You eat it. Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head. Swim. Do you notice anything. What is it? Just get there. How else do you get seaweed under your nails? The beach. Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands. You'll be me. Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona. It's attitude...how you carry yourself. We'll change your appearance. Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy. You are in trouble. Now do it. Who cares? Why not? Use my credit cards. What about it? We get on a plane. You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities... Send a man there. A secret agent. Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique... Nothing. You just do nothing. Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up. Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound. Good. Get to a phone. I'm back. I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport. Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you? Anything...A feeling...a smell..? You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away. You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me. Don't know. They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone. That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them. What do you mean? Oh my God...What did he look like, the man? Who did? Is it familiar? Have you been here before. Take a left and your next right. What does it say. With Authority! Go out, take your first left. See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993 We have to get out of here. Sue them. They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece. I'm not gonna make it easy. Ever think of what they might have to do to find me? Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here. We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility. You gotta help. You're the one talking to a little guy in your head. ...We'll have to do it on our own. I am. You are. They're busy covering their asses. They're not the type of people we need." I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance. I don't know. I don't want to find out. It can't take that long. Did you hear that? No. Don't tell the guards. Calm Down! Act rational. You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help? Too late...They want you. Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer. Then what are you stopping for? Whatever you do, just...don't stop. Outrun them. What'd he look like? What's that? Behind us? Anyone there? If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward. I'll tell you what to say. I'll talk to them. No they won't. Why don't you? You weren't listening! What was that? Yeah. You'll be alive. Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down. Yeah. Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head? You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain. Of course you do! You're not crazy. Don't do it. Don't aim at the head. Are you crazy? What for? What are you doing? I know...it sounds insane. Then how'd I get here? You've heard of U.S.T.? The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either. Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that! Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it. I'm trying to get you to listen to reason. You've heard of the PEM114... I told you, my name is Al. Quit screwing around, this is important. Yeah...Who? Who are you? I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle. Right. No. Where are we now? Yeah? ...I need to make a phone call. Why don't we go home? What street? Where are we? I just got here. What is your name? Yes. Yes. Yes? Al. Me. It wasn't him. Don't do that. What's going on? I'm...inside you. You're not gonna believe this... My name is AL. No, not her. Me. I said something. You just got a Mickey. Some friend you are! You know what I hope? I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love. Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM. It's all we've got. GO-TOE. It's some islands. I knew you were trouble. Then what? What kind of a deal? In my own way...I want you to know that...I love you. I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this. Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this. Don't worry. I'm against it. We've ruined his market in Japan.. Where's Dieter? Good. No! Don't give her your name. Do what? What'd you do? The best part. She'll love it. Doesn't matter. Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right. Sorry... Not that truth!What are you doing? That's nice. I'll get us out of here. Awwww... I want to thank you for what you've done. I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow. You're lovely. Yeah, sure. They can? Oh no! You've changed your mind. No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along. You were the one who was always suspicious of her! She works for them. Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here. I have been... I think you're right. I can always flush you down the toilet. Looks like you can have all you want. We are in a dungeon. How do we get out? Where've you been? What happened? I don't know. Do something. Pretty advanced, isn't it? Well, don't let it. What are you doing? There's a lot you don't know. Dieter! He aready made the deal.. Holy... Aim what? Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on. I can't handle that thing. Then, why'd he lead us here. And Dieter? Where? He hung us up dry. Well...? haka xuki. What's that mean? What was it? What'd I say? Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot. You sure this will work? I was afraid of that. Come on. Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got... Probably. I need a guide and you need a client...and $1000. You were with GRUNER! What? I can't see a thing. Ow! What are you doing? ...imagine a better grape for the region. I can't... What next! Too late. Don't worry! I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her. I told you, I have a feeling... You think. That's what you're good at. It is a blank. This is no time for Zen. What do I do? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Al, you leave my heart alone... Where are you going? Sapporo.. Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad. I can't keep up. On what? What do I do? I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........ Don't you think I stand out like this. Osaka? That's good. It's not better. Where? You found her. Why don't you get out of my face. It wasn't like that. No. What will you do. No. What do you hope? AL I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do? It's not your time. I get time off. She's got the most beautiful...s Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week. Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo.. I don't know! I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it. You shut down your sensors. You got any books in there? I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in. It's embarrassing. You can't listen. You can't watch either. Not her. You! This just won't work. Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct... Maybe she's telling the truth. Even Rene? Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time. How do you know? ...I've lost something. I must get it back. My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place. I don't know what's going on. Killer! Which one? I feel like an idiot. Are you serious? What glasses. That's a big if. You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know. Who, me? That place. By the window. You have no taste. The beautiful one. You want sophistication, it don't come cheap. Why not?! But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want. Mind your own business. Not blue enough. This...is not going to work out. What is it? What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing. Now, where would I be? Yeah. I did it. I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls. Rene... I made it work. Yeah. Some help. That poetry really killed her. Maybe they won't stand on ceremony. To the hotel. To register. ...Rene... ...Joe. What? Where are you staying? Wait. . What? What do I do? Help me out, will you? Which language? She doesn't seem to understand. You're beautiful.. She's beautiful...! What do I do? She's...pretty fast. This must be business, there's nothing else here. A girl. Beautiful! Are you screwing with any nerves? Al, are you doing anything in there? Where are you going? Wait! It's sand. I don't want to eat it. Eat it? Now what? You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like? Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what? Little late for that. Good Idea! The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now? ...Just beautiful. Holy shit! Eating sushi? The beach? Now what? You leave my glands alone! I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you? Oh yeah, to what? What's wrong with how I carry myself. It's just not enough. They'll know who I am. ...and a license to kill... I'll get in trouble. It's illegal. I can't do that. I don't have any. What about money? We get on which plane? You mean...just leave. Who?... Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone. What do we do? What is it? What am I supposed to do? Who is it? I'm at the airport. The airport! Hey, wait a minute. Just scratched my arm, why? Nothing! I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home. You need ID in there? Gone where? That's not a good idea. Black suits and helmets. Like the guys that attacked us. I can't remember.. The man. I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink. A lab and equipment. Where are we going? Corridor A. Which way do I go? Just walk down the hall? Now what. Door's locked. I don't like the sound of that. I'll sue. Why don't you just get out, leave me alone. Find You? I'm not leaving until you do. Thanks. I did. I brought you back here. What do you mean we. You are CRAZY! Yeah...Who is? Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you. They could put you back in the tube.. JOE Or what? Why? Yeah. Al wants to talk to you! I don't know...To get Al. How do you act when someone trys to kill you? I don't know anything. I just want to go home. Why? AL You know too much. I want out. Can't see a Goddamn thi.. I wouldn't say that. Now what? This is a Fiesta! What do I do? He's not the problem. It's the van in the back. Nothing. Just the cyclist. He's passed us. Still clear. Just a motorcycle. No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up. If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head? Oh...Gooood! Why not? Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head. Why don't I just take you back to UST? Who was that? Somebody out there? With a man in my head... Why he's argumentative? You're gonna explain. Then I'm crazy. Hear voices don't I. Used to be, things were bad. No job...no money...no girl. Now I got all that and I'm crazy too. Yep. Kill myself. Loading a gun. You said it. I just went there for a job. No. I don't know what you're talking about. Me? What'd I do? Are you threatening me? That a new Datsun? What are you doing in my head, Al? It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you? Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD! Who am I? Nerve bundle! What are you doing? You just leave the nerve bundles right where they are. Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say. You're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what I say, but you can't see anything. My place, can't you see? Somebody's been here. Shut up! Do me a favor, Al. Go home. Good idea. Get some rest. What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves. Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us. What??? You lose your lease on a condo? You're in my head? You don't know my name? No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play... What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head. I see... Your name is Al... You're in my head... This candid camera? Al. Who? Who was it? Arrrgh! Why not. ...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!! Try me. Where are you,...Al? Al ???!!! Who's you? I know you did! How about a deal? Newer, more powerful design. PEM115! I dyed it. We're all getting old. Then how did you know? I think I've heard of you. I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all. Well...I try to give them whatever they want. ...Foreign service. It is to me too. Al Viola. I don't want to intrude. You...him...UST. Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon... Not...complaining, actually. Ahhh...nothing. I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head. The little man in my... ...head... I don't know Who. Not you. Them. No, it wasn't, It was intentional. Oh yeah, thanks... What? I will? I feel fine. Oh....Sure. Oh. Here? Well what? Thanks. How do I look? Who...are you? Yeah. If I remember anything... I call ...you Remember what? Do what? Oh...that's okay. What things? Oh. What about it? What? Whatever it is, don't do it. Don't do it! Thanks, I appreciate that. A little voice in my head. Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...? That Rene...lovely girl...a killer! The fresh tuna?.. About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood. Now you know what I know. This sophistication ain't tough. All it takes is a credit card. How's that Trucklhouser Beer? How's that for fucking Savoir Fair! Oh...and who is it!? Then who did? What? What did you say? What do you want? Yes...What is it? Yeah...I have to get away. We're not moving fast enough for him. Riuji? Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats. Come on. It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now. He told me what to do. It wasn't me. It was him. Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this. He can't help us. We just don't stop. I knew it. I told him. Who are you? Who do you work for? Her? You son of a bitch! You conned me! I'll come back for you. Escape. Don't worry. Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you Now what? What? I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend. Why did you, then? I'm sorry I got you into this. They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us. Nothing we can do. What a mess. Why? Now what? What did you tell them? Looks like they can. What did they do? Are you alright? I can't fly it. Sure I can, can't I? Why not? Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him. So do I. You coming along? You've been there? ...across THE BORDER. Come on! I said just relax. I'm in full control. Maybe I'm wrong. Then GRUNER won't be here. Why'd you ask him. Oh. Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here? What? If Gruner led us away, Who'd he lead us away from? Where would you go to sell a chip? Get us one. Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time. We figure out if it's in here. He plays it all the time. Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous. Beats me. And you? And Dieter. Who was? What's Gruner like? You think I'm like that? Then why are you smiling like that? You don't believe me. Get your things. What is it? Got to trust someone. The most important one. Can you help me find him? A chip. Goes in a computer. We're very close. He stole something. From a friend of mine. You know where he went? I'm just on vacation. I'm sorry. What will you do? Why? Food doesn't agree with me. This is a tough place to keep Kosher. Who did? He didn't. Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me? Were you working for him last night? You work for Ryuji? Why did they leave? What did you tell them? Your friends, did they ask about me? Who else is interested in me? Why? Why did you stay with me? Why didn't you tell me? Why did you leave? Why'd you run off? And you, what do you like? How often they come here? Hires you for what? Is that Ryuji? No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you? ...Naw. Made that up. Just Okay... And how'm I doing? That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to? If I was with you, I wouldn't But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy. I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask? Promise you what? You are. I am sort of scattered. Disinterest? It's not apparent. Why? Me still. They left you alone? And you? Yes, of course. Wait. What's your name? What way? What's so funny? Let you leave without it. I can't do that? ...right here too. Dinner...tonight. I'll be right there. Yeah. One of the corniest lines I ever heard. The poet...something he said... ...Blake No. No one to speak of. ...I'm looking for someone. What about the others. Why'd you invite me here? Why are you on to him? Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...What is it? ...Piece of mind. It keeps me busy. Everybody always wants something. Thanks. A drink... I have a seat. I've had it since nine. Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...You take care. I do. I like your coat. Listen, I'll... see you again. You don't have to, now. You still going away? So. Yeah. It's all over. Claire! It's Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and Tommy. Yeah... "For"...? How long you going away for? I'd miss my life... It wouldn't work. I've been doing a lot of thinking. They guys treatin' you all right? Pretty bad. Do you dance? I'll think about Wednesday. Claire... I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart. Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens. When can I see you? Where? Oh that thing in Queens. Are you okay? I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through. You don't want to know. I don't know. Not exactly. You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke? I don't know you... She's okay. Everything's okay... Yeah. I do care about you! Stop being nuts! Stop, will you?! Claire...! Claire, will you calm down? No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again... It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in... Open the door, will you? Claire? Sleep good. Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire. You could do better. You asked. What's to like? What about Neil? Very nice. No dog. No dog. Yeah. Yeah. It was. ... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act... Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business. No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out. Absolutely. Look at this. Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow. Could be, I guess. No kidding. They're kind of fuzzy. How did you know? Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things. Yeah, what a woman. You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you? Claire? Big talk... Desperate guy. Sooner, the better. I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did. I'm sorry about what happened. You all right? I came on at 8:00. I'll come with you. Ah... I shouldn't... on duty. Hey! There are crazy people here. Not too sure about that. I got money. Beg pardon? No, Ma'am. Nice. Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif... Queens... You know Queens? He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times. Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home. I'm supposed to call in. Right. That's true. I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea... Uh... Hi. Hard to find doors in this place. It's okay... I've never been a detective before either... Me neither. Ellie... No. What about Tommy? El? I'm sorry. I do love you. And you are a lady. I have so much respect... Let me drive... My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take? You talked to his wife? Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. I'll talk to Garber about it. Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon. What did you watch? What did you do tonight? I'm sorry. What're you talking about -- You heard me. D'you have to say "fucking" every other word? I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother. Did you hear what I said?!! It is my fault! I'm responsible for her! Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming. Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago. It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law. I'll be right up. Few minutes. Want to catch the news. I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie? She bought it. I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit... Ellie, it was a formal party... I had to follow her to a store. She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one. What did she say the down payment was? Bought it. No! No! I'm sorry. Ninety-seven five right? I might stop you. I think -- she's crazy. Why? I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be. You don't want to hear about it. Oh, some shit. Okay? Well, actually, she looks better than that. Hey. The neighbors. I think television's a dangerous thing. Just keep it someplace safe, but handy. Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi... ... crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night. 'Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means. Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide. You got no idea... You got a great ass! I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor. Get in bed. What are you talking about? Your what...? What? Take my advice, don't buy any... Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now. Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him? What do you think? Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this. It should've been me... They're operating on him. He's still alive. What about when she identifies him?! Even Joey Venza?! It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him. But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?! What about when she goes out? Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job. I just sat and listened. No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up! He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone! He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away! Koontz, please! No, I need'm now! Koontz! I need you guys! At my house...! I just gotta talk to her, T.J. It was my fault, T.J. Fuck! Not Koontz. You in this with me? Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all. Who's Joey Venza? Right behind you, T.J. ... Hard? Yes. Uh, yeah. I'm a policeman. I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M. Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave. She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please. Is she injured? That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs... No, sir... Watch your step! I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head. Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in. Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in! Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up! Put him under the table! Let my kid go. I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door. Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It's pitch dark in here! You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door! She trusts me. She'll do what I say. I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in. I'll prove it! I brought the girl. She's outside. That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this. Take care, pal. Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing. Shooting? So, what are you doing tonight? No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father... What! What kind of pathetic line is that? She's what? What "plans?" You and Mom got "plans?" How about dinner tonight? How are things going, pal? Yeah, I think so. Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back... Lay back, Mack!! What's this "lay back, Mack?" Where does he get this? Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things. How do you know where the gun is? My special, scrambled eggs surprise.I'm all right. Hey, can we go to McDonald's? Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad? We're not going to the game, are we Mom? The gun? It's in the upstairs closet. Keep what handy? I don't think she can sing, either. Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. 'Bye, Dad. Shooting. We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons. You coming in? We're gonna pass the street. She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company. He thinks she's got a great voice. She's taking singing lessons. Mom and I got plans. Okay, I guess. Nice threads Dad. God! Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...! God! Lay back, Mack. I know where everything is. Scrambled eggs surprise? What're we having?Time to activate Plan B. They're gaining on us! We blew it, Edgar! We lost it! We don't ride with vampires. They wouldn't be out in the daytime. You better get a garlic T-shirt, buddy. Why not? He's a vampire alright. Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet. Can't stand light? Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us. We're fighters for Truth, Justice, and the American Way. Yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh? How do you like Santa Carla? This one could save your life. Just passing through Santa Carla? The meanest! Maximum body-count. You know what? You're absolutely right. Whattaya mean? Two down and two to go. Did you see that sucker burn?! Good. They're gonna book us. We unraveled in the face of the enemy! Should I run him through? The nightcrawler. The bloodsucker. Zero. Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.You're one of us, now -- aren't you? If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us. Hey, take it easy. What's goin' on, Marko? Get your bike. We're going someplace. Why? They're only noodles. You're eating maggots. How do they taste? So how do you like those maggots, Michael? Good idea. Marko. We're hungry. You don't have to beat me, Michael. Just try to keep up. C'mon, Star. Climb on. Honda 250, huh? No, Star. Put it down. Put it down. You can't kill me, Star. You're almost one of us now, Michael. Sorry, Michael. No hard feelings, huh? Here. Try these noodles. No. Stick around. With him? Where you going?It's you I was after all along, Lucy. To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no. It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy. One big happy family. My boys... and yours . Well... what do I know? I'm a bachelor. Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you. Let me tell you something about boys. They're like weeds. They grow best when they're ignored. Something the matter? Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change. I don't want to fight with you, Lucy. Come on. Let's give it one more try. Dinner at my house, tomorrow night. I'm cooking. Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you. Our batting average isn't very good is it? So far we're zero for two. It's garlic !! I like garlic, but... This looks terrific, Lucy. Oh, right. I always gets those two confused. Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner? Yeah. Runaways, mostly. They come from all over. Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean. Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute. But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it? So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me. Not impressed, are you? I know. It's so 'Eighties.' It's the Cute Decade. Say hello to Thorn. -- a job. So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy? We've got it all. Best selection in Santa Carla. You've got a generous nature. I like that in a person. My name is Max. Michael invited me in. Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless. Yeah. I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom. I just want to be your friend. Burn?? Are you kidding? It's freezing! Okay, Sam. Thanks.What is this, David? Where's Star, David?! Where is she?! What's going' on? I'm my own man. Don't! Stop! What?... We were gonna grab some food. I can't beat a Triumph. Star?... That's right. We still going? Sam, don't -- I said, I'll take you there . Nobody's going near Star without me. I'll take you there. David. Of course not! Get out, Mom! Run! I didn't invite you in this time! Gotta go, Mom. Can't. Got plans of my own. Mom... please. I'm tired now. We are... Sure. Okay. I watch him all day. The only time I have more myself is at night. Let Grandpa watch him. No. I'm up. I'll pass. See you later. I'll hitch. It's early. Why do we have to go home? He's not breathing, Mom. He looks dead. For what. It's gone. I feel it! They'll be coming for all of us. Huh? You've got to put this on. You're not going anywhere... Sam... I know, I've felt it... Then it's not too late for us... Why not? That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood! David's blood. I'm one of them, Star! I'm just like them! Do you know where David took me tonight, Star? Do you?! Okay. When? I have to talk to you. Please wake up. Let's go see them. Now you and David... I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you. Ouch. Are you hungry? Wanna get something to eat? Sort of. We used to come here summers when I was kid. Now we're here on a permanent basis. I'm Michael. Ex-hippies. My mom was one. I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something. But Star's great. I like Star. Oh. Your folks, too, huh? What's your name? Hi... I just wanted to... I, uh... Well... yeah. Sure. Well, I... I... I don't feel any differently. Do you? Huh?... Who are you calling? Star. I don't know. Just for a few days, Sam. Give me a chance to work this out by myself. No! We can't tell Mom! Please, Sam. Don't tell her. We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me. What?? He was protecting you ! Nothing! I didn't hurt him. He bit me ! This is my blood! Nanook... Don't turn on the light. Piss off. Don't bother. Mom's home?... No. I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food. No. Why? What would that make Mom? I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots. Entertain yourself. Go away. Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.' Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay? Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night? Nowhere. You're beautiful. Okay. I'll flip you for it. This room is mine. Hey, Sam, we're flat broke. Will you give Mom a break? This is kind of a cool place. That's okay, Mom. I can see it later. I'll help you unload.What's Plan B? Well... we blew Plan A. You gotta drive! Burn rubber does not mean warp speed ! Fine! Stay here! I'll have to drive! Exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed? He's my brother. Yeah. Wears sunglasses in the house . All day. I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you. I don't like horror comics. You better get some fresh air. This isn't a comic book store, right. It's a bakery. It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian. I don't like horror comics. No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection? What happens in tow and a half hours? No, Nanook! Quiet! There's a cop behind us. Oh, no... I thought they'd be in coffins. What's that smell!? Chill out Edgar. He's telling the truth! Aren't you, Michael? Hit the lights again. How do you know they're not? Well... he only shows up at the store after dark. And today, his dog attacked my mom. Listen to this. From Vampires Everywhere ... 'Vampires require a daytime protector -- a Guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. For it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. Since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell -- are often employed for this purpose .' I have something to tell you guys. Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's dating one! I can't do that! His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath. Now I get it... you're like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. You're part of a cult. Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something? Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and... And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's. I guess so. She said not to be late. Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight. I thought we were goin' into town. Great. I wanna get some new comics. Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck. What's all that wood in there for? Good! Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk! Thanks, Grandpa... You have a T.V.? Mom! -- I'm not talking about Max! To hell with Max! No, I'm not... But, Mom... This is not a joke. They know that we know about them. They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark! Vampires, Mom! Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers! The TV stations! They'll listen to you. They'll believe you... you're a mom ! Must be a circuit breaker. C'mere, Nanook. Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen. These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan. The Frog Brothers. Do you mind? It was a real scary comic. Can I sleep in here with you tonight? He's already gone to bed. Sorry, Mom. It was a mistake. I thought I saw something out the window. I was reading this horror comic and I guess I go a little carried away... We can't talk about it on the phone. Mom. I think we've got to have a long talk about something? Soon as I finish this comic. Okay? Can we get a T.V.? He met a girl. Help me, Mom. Help. So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me. When you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to Berkeley, spent the night in Golden Gate Park and begged for spare change in the morning? I thought we were poor. Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later. Grandpa's expecting us. Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach! Smells like something died. What's that smell? What?! Did you know that!? But you passed the test! I am? Does it burn? How about a little Parmesan cheese on that? What's the matter? Michael! Get behind the wheel. The Marines. Don't kill anybody until we get back to you... It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them? I don't know, Michael. This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'. What about Mom? Look at your reflection in the mirror!! What did you to do him, Michael? Why did he bite you? What about Nonook? What have you done to Nanook?! What have you done to my dog, you asshole?! What happened, Michael!? Michael? You have such a great personality, Michael. You should open your own charm school. Lose the earring, Michael. It's not happening. It's just not happening. I'm making you a sandwich. No. On the phone. Wanna go to the comic book store? The bottoms of your feet are covered with salt. Did you spill something? You're right... not even to mention you and me. You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you? What did you do last night? You look wasted. You're supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood. Do I have to do this? Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember? Then what's the rush? You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it? I'm at the mercy of your sex glands! Where are we going? Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face. I was here first. Even poor people have T.V.s Grandpa does not own a T.V. Have you noticed? There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV. I will not know anything hip happening anymore. I'm so excited I just can't hide it. I'm about to lode control and I think I like it. What!? He can and I can't ?! No fair!!Why? Congratulations on history's longest winning streak. He excels at gratitude. Okay. I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him -- Hi. No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long. This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry. No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard. Can I ask you something? You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right? It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it. London. That's a promotion! Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you? Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us. What did they do with you? I'll put her on. Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry. The pointers were great. I'll study the tape. Oh, God, no! No? It's not loaded. Just don't physically... Fantastic tip -- fantastic. I don't like being handled. What? It just might not work for me because of our different approaches. This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently. Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie. I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry. I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states. There are only ten. Okay. Don't name them. Just tell me if you know. We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they? Can you name all the members of the Cabinet? And the rule was... Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal? You have the job you have... You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly. Oh, stop it. Keep it to yourself. How you doing? You've made my dreams silly. Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause. Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea. Nice, Jane. You write this? Yeah. Shit, shit, shit... Stop the tape, okay. Forget it, Ellen. Let's call security and get him out. Which would you prefer? You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions? Eventually rising to... You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department. I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right? That's your full name? It's Mr. Buddy Felton? Well -- my wife got this new job... So who's the guy? Really? I hope so... No. I'm not really mad. I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay? I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him... ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies. Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations. Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part. Let's go... Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago. Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher. Speaking. Hi. Will I ever sing again? I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me. Yes, yes. I know. Right. And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you. How do you like that? -- I buried the lead. Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told. No. You know that I'm not. What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi-serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen. And he'll get all the great women. I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil. You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about. Aaach...Jane... Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. You know? Let me think a second. It's tough. Yeah. Well...I think it is important for you too. Sit down. Don't go. No!!!!! Call him -- I mean it can wait, right? I don't know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway. And I'm chipper because you finally showed up. I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good? No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack. I'm not kidding. People phoned in. It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway? I lost six pounds... No. No. Define your terms. Then it went well. You didn't see it or speak to anybody? Thanks, Jane. Have a good time tonight. If ...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment. Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio. Yes. Because this is important -- so don't just be polite. I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?... Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date. Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie? I didn't know you were going with him. They're not that dumb, after all. Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here? Good. Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go? Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not tell you? -- it's a happy thing. In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further. Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner. I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why. You're welcome. Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too. We're very busy here. Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange. I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here. Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'. Watch? -- What happened? Not because you have to. Can you believe it? I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups. We can cut back at the end. Did you shoot their boots? Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me. I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material. Eleven and a half. They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the Times and he had a great audition tape. Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on? I'd give anything if that were true. Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high? Okay. Let's do me. Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom. He must have been great-looking, right? Where's where I asked him about being scared? You should work on your speech. Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>]. Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now. But he's not ever gonna change. He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie. He feels no different. He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully. Hi. Turn on your TV... Good Morning America , the Morning News and Today are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them. In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war. But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money. Oh, you mean use him...That's nice. Okay. In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. He... No -- Don't worry about it. Let's do this. It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it. Ready. So I quit. They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line. Thanks. Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while. Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy? Do it then. Do one thing to me? Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it. I think it could turn them around. Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God. They want to fire me. Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it. Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness. Wipe me out? Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that. Outside? I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi. That's it. I resign as of now. You didn't say anything to her? I'm gonna go look at it again. All this business of war -- do you get scared? It depends on how big a news day it is. How long has it been since you've been home. We came from Washington. Just a few questions? No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser. Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division. Oh, come on -- tell us another. Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a Homecoming The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children. But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal. Oh, that's nice... We'll need some new lines. What is she shooting?The cost-efficient reporter. It's what he did. I'm proud of him. I understand. I'll go with you. It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things. Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time. I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner. All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They... I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it. Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to... Upper management thinks you're dull. Anyway. I want you to think of this as... We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right? I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you. Yeah -- Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk? Stop it. I had the strangest thing happen yesterday. Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again. I saw the smile -- good piece. Bye, sweetie. No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help. They fired me. Tell me I'm on the way in.Finish quickly. I don't want you getting obsessive about these things. Good night. You don't have to finish tonight. Jane -- For God's sake... Look, it's time for you to go to sleep. Honey?...If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know. It's nice to see you. Are you any closer to a decision? I'll see you back at the hotel. I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you. Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name? You know what I... I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way... Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party? Hold it down, okay? I don't think so. London. You packing up tonight? Why? What did they do to you? They booted me out of Washington. No. Don't worry about it. Everybody has one like that. I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end. You were smokin' toward the end there. And the left side of your face is the good one. Go again. And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story. Punch -- come on -- Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you? No. No. I'll find some copy. Be right back. No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going. Sit on it! Now look. Your coat jacket is rising up in back. Wait. We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want. What's wrong with it? Fifty, right? You're feeling good, aren't you? Yes. Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet. Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd... Never to pretend to know more than I did. I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports... Shut up a second... I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if... You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you. Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams? What did I do to you? You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second? Hi, Aaron...What's doing? ...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'. One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury. Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs? You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do. I'll speak to you. Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work. No. I'm doing fine...Look. Oh. Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong? Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing... Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore. What do you mean? You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to. No. Really...don't worry about it. That's okay. Nobody else had it. Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds. Thanks a lot, Buddy. Yes. How do you know? What? I really have to go. No...no. Yes. That's right. I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still... Follow me. No, I don't think so. That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good? Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please? I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will. I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete. It's not. Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things. No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick." No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess. I don't know. No. Not even you. Okay...It's so good to see you. Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila. What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington. A picnic? Take it easy. Then you should stay here. You want to come? Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it. What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true. What do you think? Never mind what you think. Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news. You keep coming after me and looking down on me. It's starting to make me batty. I'm leaving now. Gate 43. This is a one-way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket. It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they? I got promoted for things like that. Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane... We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time? I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming? Why? Then give me a minute... That's yes? Sorry. I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this. Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion. That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes. Yes. Then he said a really weird thing... He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty. Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule. Okay. Good night. Hello? I'll see you at the office. Good night. I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep. No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight. Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him? I know. I taped it. Well, when? Where are you? It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up. Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind. I'd like to know. I'll go along. That's not it. What? I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did. Because you're nuts. You just can't stop editing me. Huh? Why can't I let go of this woman? You okay? You're not going to take off on me, are you? Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that? Me! It's incredible who's here. Yeah. So what did you think? I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole. We can go together. Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go. No. Were you going to you? No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday? What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow. It's not important. Yes. I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane? If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that? I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me. Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something. I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own. Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy... Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little? Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all? I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight. Jennifer, you want to have another drink? There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones. I didn't think you'd make it. I'll wait for you till seven. Jane? You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.' Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex. You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head. George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might. Excited. You okay? You're great at taking the edge off a good time. At work there's always this sort of film over you. It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty. Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you. The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work. I have it cold, confirmed. They have five million dollars in this thing already. I've got another story. Ah, I don't want any credit. Bobbie and I serve anonymously. So he was indicted? Okay. Can I buy you dinner sometime soon? Hi. And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there? You make me nervous. Anyway if I can pick your brain -- I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if... I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now -- I'm sorry if I was in the way. It was totally impressive. Great piece. They said it would be okay if... Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry. I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for. Whoa, this was a mistake. Uh-huh. One year...almost one year. But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks. I don't write. I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and... Listen to me. You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it. I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter. And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about. It isn't that I'm down on myself. Trust me, I stink. Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at. No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up. Yes, sure. That actually goes on... Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry. I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to. I have about two thousand questions for you. I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight. More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what? I was a lot earlier. Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that. I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick. I'm not knocking it. It's a great solution. Not only the storage but you can see everything you have. Where's the bathroom? It would never occur to me to worry at all about you. This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it? Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat. So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team. ...that way we have someplace to go when we cut. And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy. I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um... Don't be silly. What are you sorry about? Are you okay? That's enough. That's enough.So pee? Here? I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee. Yes I do have to pee! Knock what off? That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave. I didn't have to pee then. I really gotta pee. They say sex is great for cramps. Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty? Hey, how about a little nightcap? Well, whattdaya think? So there I was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "Son, you got into Harvard!" It took three of them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating. You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat. Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf. You hungry? No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it? Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay. So you're Grant's secretary?Packages of money. How big? You got a dog? Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive. And the last to see Gregory alive. You heard about Carlton Fraser? We can get a warrant if you like. A kiss? Did you have sex with him? Looks like it was your only date. Unless you go to his funeral. Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment? It's about Gregory Jameson. He's dead. Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard? Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims. And that was 28 days ago today. She says she's on the rag every time I get called in to investigate a murder. My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days. Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there... I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house... And fifth, you're dating her. It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass. You think mafia hit? Like a vampire or some shit? It's a bit farfetched that Mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense. One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed. This one walk you home too? Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive... Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes. Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park. Sounds like you got a conflict of interest. She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them. This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead. I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase. And he was missing an arm. And you think I'm sick? Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush. Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse. I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull? Hey, there was a lot of blood. Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know. Nah, man, I'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive. No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her. Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick. I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird. Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess. Hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria's Secret. Bitches are outta control these days. You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk. Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.Wow. Yeah? I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River? Come on, I'm your biggest supporter. It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened. These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs. I did something stupid. I had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money -- so I kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me. Come on Frida, I'm not kidding. I'm totally fucked. Let me in. It's a matter of life and death. Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in. I'm kinda borrowing it. Who's this, Mr. Date-Guy? I'm working on it... Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me... Frida, you know you're it for me. OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this? Shit. And you're eating my burger? You don't eat meat. Look what you did! You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra? You look different. I mean you look good. What, you got a date or somethin'?Very well then. Is that all? No? Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women. I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk. Yes, that's what we're looking for. Did you change your hair? Coffee and... Script coverage? The Nielson's?Thanks. I'm going to take a shower. I know. The important thing is that it stop. No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves. Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer. We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems. I knew you wouldn't kill me. I'm staying here with you tonight. There's no getting rid of me. Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you? I have the silver bullets in case I need to protect myself. Does that make you feel better? I don't think you would. No matter what form you take. I don't think you'll hurt me. I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you. If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf. Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that. You at least owe me the truth. Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me? What? Is there someone else? Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over. No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay? No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural. Your breasts feel larger. You know, I've never seen your cat. What's with the squirt guns? You didn't say it. Is that how you feel? Is it that funny? You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite. That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days. Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country. Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times? Except Mark of course. Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead. I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all. What happened? I need to talk to you. About us. Frida... I... Can I carry your box? Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs? He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment. Still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it. No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date. You had a date with Carlton? Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important. A man killed in Central Park. You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check? Was there anything in that washer? No. I was doing my laundry. Frida, wait. Don't go. We can just sleep. I just want to wake up with you. I mean we can still... whatever... Maybe I should get a towel? Oh, nothing's wrong. Just... well don't you have your period? I'm a cop -- I notice everything. That drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when I left... Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people collect beanie babies... I collect silver bullets. Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix. Goodnight. Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime? Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up? Briefs. Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line. You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear. Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something. The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since. We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area. I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think. No, she died when I was twelve. My mom used to get PMS too. I can forgive you a bestseller. No really, I love knowing what people read. So what book did you buy? Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together. Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off. You wanna get some coffee? There's a lot of that going around. Being a cop has such a warm effect on people. At least let me give you this back. I washed it. No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why. You busted me. Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call. When's the last time you saw him? He's been running money for the Mafia. Why would you want to be a cop? We can just take this pillowcase. We're just trying to figure out what happened. Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night. What kind of animal? Did we get those DNA tests back? So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton. What makes her think that? What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here. What are you talking about? Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer. Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute. It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes. Spencer's the key here. Frida is in no way associated with him. And her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings. Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead. He means the last that we know of. She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was. Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him. The park dude was missing an arm. You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex. She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys. Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them. We only live a few blocks apart. He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park. What? Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their natural state. Madonna's in Penthouse? Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body? She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this. I told you she was innocent. I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation. Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag? That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period? He was found a few blocks away. You're some catch Lloyd. Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?Yes you can.... Give me a hand here for Christ's sake.... My vision is perfect.... There's nothing to be sorry about. Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why. Blushing suits you.... I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody. There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations.... Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean. We could take a few days.... I borrow it without telling him.... I'll nick the boss' plane again.... I like to travel.... I could take some time off.... I dreamed about always being warm... Stay a while.... I tried winter once. Burlington, Vermont. Flew a run to New York. I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed. When I was a small boy.... But it gets cold in winter.... Our little island seems to agree with you.... I have two right feet. Would you suffer through a dance with me? All or nothing. You want to roll them for me? Couple of more passes and I'll buy my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own airline.... A big one.... A drink with an umbrella in it.... Give it up... Kick it in the ass... Get on with your life.... Sharks come and go, Ellen. People don't have anything to do with it.... No, you're not.... What's wrong? How do you like flying? They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut.... Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters.... One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon. Went down in the jungle.... You're doing fine. I'll keep you out of trouble. Relax.... It's just like driving a car.... If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute. No one does till they learn.... Sure you can.... Boss' day off...Take the wheel.... Depends on where you want to go.... I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities.... It could have been an accident.... I always listen to my feelings.... Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier.... Mostly it feels like driving. You digging for buried treasure? I'm the captain of this majestic ship. It goes where I take it.... First time for everything is the best. After that you know too much and it's never quite the same. I own the airplane. I can do whatever I want. I'm the boss. Can you keep a secret? Something no one else knows? Just like that? You the architect? I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....' Want to go for a little ride? The wind does that. Ever been to the Bahamas before? I'll get it back next time. I have coffee in the thermos. Aye, aye, Captain.... Maybe the plane gave it indigestion.... What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ... Will you get the bloody hell out of here.... Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get going...I'll keep it busy.... Hell, no. What kind of pilot do you think I am...? Grab your socks.... She said it was coming.... When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up. Don't worry.... You're going after her in that? You're crazy...It'll take all day in that bathtub.... I hope she's a good sailor.... It was theirs anyway. I 11 buy us all a drink.... The damn thing is going to have our asses.... Nothing! What the hell are you doing down there? All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain.... Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion.... I fly elephants for smugglers.... What's that....? The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers. Good news travels fast....He knows what he has to do.... We'll divert it...We'll do something.... We're going down. All of us.... Get the bang sticks. We're going down. What difference does it make? It's here.... You have something to say about everything.... We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it.... Michael! Michael! This thing working? Keep it steady.... They spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it They don't care what it is.... Get her started.... It'll come for the plane. It's attracted to metal. The electro- magnetic impulse.... You sure you know how to do this. What do you mean, it'll find her? She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it. We couldn't.... You got a better idea...? A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it.... We'll buy you one. We're having a party.... I'm the one who wanted to study it.... We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you. Get it on me.... No way.... My equipment doesn't crap out.... I forgot my rubber gloves. Let's do it. Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch. Just like taking a picture. Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away.... All the time.... If it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it'll shock the hell out of it. We'll need a slave switch to set it off. Pull the dry cell out of the radio. You jump, you'll kill yourself.... What the hell are you doing? Holy Christ.... You told me what? Tough shit. 'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...' You don't like my voice...? You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one? 'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...' Don't be so down, man. Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made.... 'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....' 'A Moray eel....' A Moray eel...A Moray eel.... Just trying to be helpful.... Maybe he only likes white meat.... Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday. Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry.... I live to hear the sound...You all right? She's not going to like it.... What about Carla's gig? I don't like it.... It's my turn in the barrel, man.... Close...I don't know...Just get the hell.... Nothing.. But stay within a quarter mile...I've got a three-mile radius on the monitor. If he comes back I'll hear him. You'll have time to get up. If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie.... We lost it.... He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around.... Half don't...Bring her about.... Bring her about. We're headed in the wrong direction.... You think he's not good enough for her? You're right. If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now. I don't remember. One day he was just here.... Who? Bring her to starboard. As long as he's been here.... What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this? What? Shit.... What are we getting out of this old bucket? So far.. Lots of times.... You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned.... I thought we were planning a long rosy future together. The shark will get it for us. We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas. There's never been one down here before. I'm not just going to let it swim away. Okay...we got it together.... When I invited you... When I got the grant..... Okay.. .we're done, man.... We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine? You got two of them...? As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch.... Gave them the day off.... Down here.... You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark. A great big bloody wonderful shark. Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it. We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research.... Holy shit! What? I've struck the mother-lode. I'm counting... spade work.... Stop busting my hump.... You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics. You're never going to amount to anything. You're afraid of the competition out there.... A regular tropo...Spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants. You want to be a bum all your life, be my guest. Not me. I'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot.... I know a guy who got money from them to study eels.... Money is money.... Office of Naval Research has some money.... May your sex life be as busy as your shirt.... Bad boy.... Where the hell's the beer...? They won't fight with me.... I missed you, is all. It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne.... Shouldn't pick on that. Sorry. I'm sorry about your brother.... You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie.... A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside.... You didn't stick them on right.... I made them, man.... The readings suck.... If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems.... We'll pass around cigars.... You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man.... You tagging them...? How many...? Try the area around the wreck.... Stop farting around.... You want to be careful how you talk to me... I'm about to become famous...You should see.... Woman has taste.... Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed.... She's in management.... I just want to make an honest woman of you.... Happy birthday, darling. ... Now wait a minute... I'm being serious here.... More beautiful with each passing minute... Who grows more beautiful.... I knew there was a reason I could afford this. To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful.... How much longer? This is supposed to be your party. Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....I'm sorry. Please, Carla. I didn't think there was any danger. I'm sorry. I love you. Both of you. Where's my mother? Where is she? Sweetheart.... It went away.... But it went away...We would have known.... What's wrong? What happened? They're at the beach.... I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy. Off.... Turn it off.... No fair, I'm not armed. What the hell are we arguing about? Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage.... I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out.... How come it's my responsibility? I thought artists worked with their subconscious.... My brain is shrinking. There's only so much room. I miss him, Matt. I still can't believe he's gone. I'll be right there. Big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks.... Make a list. She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach.... It sure is.... My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets.... No way.... Please, Mom. At least consider it. You should get away. You shouldn't be alone now.... Nowhere.... It was a piece of wood. A shitty piece of wood. It's not fair.... He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way.... I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night.... I'm going to finish what Jake and I started. I owe him that. Hell, I owe him everything.... I'll get something important done for both of us.... I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be.... Promise me you'll be all right.... There's a lot...I want to talk about it.... Why'd you take the boat? It got him.... No. I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark. Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up. I don't want to talk about that. There's nothing to worry about.... I m not unhappy. Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little. It'll work out.... I have to get this finished. I'm fine.... Trying to write our report.... You just got here.... I'm pleased. I really am. Really.... Good. You're not a pain in the ass.... I don't like him chasing around after you...I don't trust him.... You're having a good time.... I'm not going to quit now.... Mom, please don't start that again.... Nothing out of the ordinary.... Good. So will I.... Okay. All you all right? Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something.... Come on, I'll show you around. It's Jake's actually...Our floating lab.... There's never been a great white where we live. It's warm water... They don't like it.... Dad died from a heart attack.... Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo. Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person.... Mom, you're upset. Sit down...Please.... I'm just getting started.... Come on, Mom, you can't be serious.... What? Sit down, Ma.... Mother.... It needs more time to charge. What happened? Come on, Hoagie.... Can't this thing go any faster? What do you deliver on all those charters you...? I want you to leave her alone. I don't want you involving her in.... Mind if I cut in? Your date's lonely.... Jake tells me you're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table.... I'll get her. Have a good Christmas, Matt.... It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them. The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing.... Would you talk to her? She's got it in her head that the shark came for him. She still blames it for my father's death.... I wish there was something I could do.... She has good days and bad...I don't know.... Inch by inch.... We'll be done pretty soon.... Still chasing fish? You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel.... Matt? Jake. It's my fault...I have to.... I'll do it, Jake. Your equipment has crapped out again.... The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his.... If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself.... It'll work.... Anybody ever tell you you're nuts.... I've got to get to her.... Mom.... Screw you, Jake.... I don't like the song. Stop that! Shove it.... Shit.... 'Snuck up on me....' 'It was so ugly...It was so big....' Funny, Jake...Funny. How come only me? What about the monitor...? You getting anything on the shark? You getting a reading on them? I'm going down, Jake.... I didn't ask you to.... You fall off a horse, you get right back on or you don't ride again.... I'm coming...How close is it? I've got about a half dozen...I'm going to tag them. You hearing anything? Maybe it's gone.... Maybe the gear crapped out.... I hear he flies a lot of private charters.... I am...You must know something about him.... Half the pilots down here fly drugs ...He's always going off.... What's so funny about that? What do you know about him? Hoagie. How long has he been here...? How long? How long have you known Hoagie? How long have you known Hoagie? What she's got. Nine knots.... And it's always worked? You sure you've done this before? I don't know shit about electronics.... So did I.... My name goes on that report. It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate. Neither do you.... We have at least three months' work left. We can't write a report...We don't know enough.... We got it together, Jake.... When I signed on.... When we got the grant.... We don't write up anything until we're done.... What for? We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor? What happened to Clarence and...? Where is everybody? Don't say anything about this to my mother.... Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor.... Spade's a garden tool.... I wish you wouldn't say that.... Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me.... How many? He's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own.... It's not a bad life, Jake.... They put bombs on dolphins.... Forget it.... Sharp shirt, Jake.... I didn't do it on purpose.... Maybe I missed you too.... Put me down, damnit.... Put me down.... Yeah, well, just stop yelling. Hey! You couldn't find your ass with both hands.... If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak.... I stuck them on, man.... Maybe it's the tags that suck.... I know how to tag a damn conch.... If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done.... We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate.... The females have eggs.... I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen.... Will you leave me alone...? Stop busting my hump....A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day. Okay. Yes. His brother. I'm going to bed now. Thank you, Rose. What? I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend. Rita. Pass the wine. I don't wanna talk about it. I won't pay for nothing. I have no money! I don't like him. Nobody. Loretta is getting married. You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming. Rose, pass the wine. I don't wanna talk about it. I don't wanna talk about it. And that's how much I'm saying. I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more. You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips. Hi. Hi. Alright. I didn't see you here. You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp! Who is this man? You're engaged! What are you doing here? What'd you do to your hair? Let's go tell your Mother. Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing. It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring. That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring? He did? Maybe. I didn't give you away the first time. I won't come. More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it? Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me? No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man? What killed him? You did this once it didn't work out. Again? What's your news? Ti amo. I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death. Bed. I don't know. I got a feeling. I like your dress. It's very bright. They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess. I brought you something. The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right. And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding. No, I want to see the dessert cart. And I'll have the special fish. We will both have the Salad Ticino. Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight? You haven't said anything. I don't know what you mean. I have my eyes open. Hello, Mr. Castorini. What? In time, you will see that this is the best thing. I must ask for that back. If I marry you my mother will die. Loretta, I can't marry you. I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone. Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away. We should talk alone. Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful. The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away. Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it? He's my younger brother. There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding. I'll call you when I get to Mama's house. Yeah. Alright. A month. In a month. Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back? A week. Two weeks. No more. My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married. Seven-thirty. I like this ring. Alright. This is a good suit. On the floor? I don't understand. What do you mean? Yes? Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Have Something. My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes. Never is a long time. A man who can't control his woman is funny. Maybe you're right. No? Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk. You don't know where Loretta is? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe because he fears death. Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman. Who was that? Yes. The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig! My mother's recovered. That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle. Maybe I should go? It's late. Where is she? Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. I came right from the airport. And you are a son who doesn't love his mother! Because my mother was dying! But now she's not. It was a miracle! Of course I want to. Have you come to make peace with me? Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death! Loretta...Yes! I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous. At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house. You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other. What do you want me to do? Pick up after five dogs? I'm eighty-three years old. God in his heaven understands that I cannot pick up after five dogs. Good morning, Lucy. I will. But I must find the right moment. Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner. If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick. Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say. I don't know. My granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. But he does not want to pay. My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby. Lucy. There are big things going on in my house. My granddaughter Loretta, the only daughter of my son Cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.Thanks, comrade. Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka? What happened? Do you have a girlfriend? May I presume to ask you a question? Can I get another one of these? Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka? I'm freezing Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. I'm a little cold. People home. I guess you can't invite me in? Temperature's dropping. You knew that man? May I walk with you a ways? I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect. Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming. Nerves. Go ahead. Then why are you eating alone? I'll remember that. What do you do? Yes. Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U. Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. Are you sure? Sorry. That was rude. Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you? My lady friend has a personality disorder. I'm sorry if we disturbed you.No. You were there. I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better. Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? We just come from the bank. Hi, Loretta. You gotta date? Oh. Did you see it? Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES... WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU! I knew she had it. Oh. Right. You see that moon last night? I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over! So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around. And you were a lamb. As soft as milk. I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso! I don't know. Cosmo. I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. Is he down there? No. It's Cosmo's moon. Look. Rita. Rita. Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark? Will you marry me. Loretta? Loretta, what are you talking about? No, I'll tell him. No. I'm gonna wait. Good! We can get this out on the table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. Is Johnny here? Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on! No. No. I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other. I was. Why? Yeah. Yeah. That's right. We're here. I'm here! And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again? Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta. You're making me feel guilty again. What's the matter? Yeah. It smells like snow. What do you want to do now? I think that's it. Yeah. Awful? It's the best thing there is. Come on. I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera. Thank you! He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in. Marc Chagall. A Russian. Thank you. You look beautiful. Your hair... Hi. Alright. Meet me at the Met. I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life. That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera. Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing. But he wants me to come! I'll come to the wedding. I can't! I'm in love with you! I can't do that! What? Oh no I didn't! You ruined my life. What did you do? She didn't like me. All right, I'm guilty. I confess! You're trying to make me feel guilty. Don't just become excited. Take it easy. What? It makes you look like an angel. It's so bright. I don't know. I think it's the moon. What? Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left. What about Johnny? I've got you. Loretta. Your blood. I was dead. I can't believe what is happening. To the bed. Son of a bitch! A bride without a head! He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head! Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool! Stop it! What are you doing! I'm a wolf? You don't know nothing about it. Yes. She was right to leave me. Why you talking to me? I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that. Stupid yourself. How many men since then? When your husband get hit by the bus? No. I don't know. Why? When you get engaged? Fast. How'd he die? Where'd Johnny find you? This is good. Uhh... I like it well done. You don't have to help me. Loretta. What's that smell? I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget? That's it. It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc� saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man. No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife! Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat! I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me. I have no life. You are going to marry my brother? Why? Have you come from my brother? What's wrong can never be made right. Why didn't he call himself? Yeah, this is Ronny. You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life. I'm sure she did. Well. Yeah. You may not want to. Good. Johnny...Don't hold your breath. They're healing up nicely. How's your hand? Good morning, Jennifer. Yes. I'm going to see her tonight. It was great seeing you again. I'm glad you dropped by. To old friends. And your new dreams. The city that never sleeps. So what will you do now? I'm glad things have worked out for you. What's happening? It beats Dr. Simm's theory. She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll. Don't hold back on us, Max. We need all the help we can get. Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day. Just go. Kristen needs you. Keep her awake somehow. Do it. Oh Christ. Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night. They sedated her. Nancy... Who would know where they were hidden? The question is, what happened to Freddy's body? I've heard crazier things this week. Bullshit. Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good. Besides, we do have a choice. You're not going in. That's exactly what he wants. As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you. There's nothing we can do. It's out of our hands. Anything? This isn't possible. And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here? Did you drag me in here too? Everybody take five. Breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there's no tension left in your bodies. None at all. Keep following the pendulum... Okay, we're going to try a little group hypnosis. You sound like Peter Pan. I can do that. Try me. For what? I'm running out of answers. A patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access. A girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. Nothing makes sense anymore. Doesn't matter. We're gonna try. I can't believe I just did that. I'm sorry, Nancy. The answer is no. So do I. Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with. you have no business taking it yourself. You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers? With Hypnocyl? The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems. That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford? Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me. I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count? Sounds like a rough time. Sorry. Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much. your parents still live around here? Never been here before? Yes, tell us, Nancy. Well, we've got -- You're late. Only if you call me Neil. What was that nursery rhyme all about? Ms. Thompson. Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour. So I've been told. Practically an obsession of your. What's that supposed to mean? Ever work with vets? These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat. We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview. I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake. Right. They seem to share a group delusion, a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word. They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep. You'll get to meet them all tomorrow. They're...survivors. In a way. All severely sleep disordered. Insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting... Somebody else is out here. What? You're about to attend a funeral. One that's long overdue. We've got work to do. How do we get in? You said something before...about laying him to rest...? Freddy. My God. The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it? Some kind of scandal... This wing's been closed for years. What was this place? I beg your pardon? I could've saved them. You do volunteer work at the hospital? There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort. I've seen you before. Sister...? Science...I suppose. For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you? Listen to them. I'll go straight to Carver if I have to. He'll either back me up or accept my resignation. Nothing. They're my patients. It's my decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers. Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl. It's a dream suppressant. That's enough, Kincaid. Okay, Group's in session. Straight talk only in this room. Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help. I know these kids. I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published. Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro. Don't worry, it won't come to that. Cooling down.Right behind you. Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along. No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here. Now what, Dutch. You going to send your mystery guest an invitation? That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait. What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes. What the hell do you think you're doing? You're wastin' your time. I can accept that, it comes with the job. We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us. The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this? She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us. We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that? Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story. That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to. Jesus... this is inhuman. Uh... I wasn't told of any operations in this area. They shouldn't have been here. Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time. They're getting better equipped every day. You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!! No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own. Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals. Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are. Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya. That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. Beautiful. No way, old buddy. We both got scores to settle. Take a position over there. I'll work around towards you. When I flush him, you nail him... What, Sergeant? Thanks.Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one. Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing. Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39. You're quick. I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed. It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38. I could kill you now. We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone. I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss. Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way? What do I do? You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted. Don't say that, Vizzini. Please. Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. I thought I was going faster. I only dog paddle. Anybody want a peanut? I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl. You never said anything about killing anyone. Who's Guilder? I'll be right back. I hope we win... Inigo. Don't pester him, he's had a hard day. At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it. Will this do? Over the Albino, I think. You've been mostly dead all day. How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works? Has it been fifteen minutes? Inigo -- there's more than thirty -- I have a little. The body? Everybody ... MOVE!! The Man in Black? But you don't know where he is. -- where? -- what? -- I don't think more than ten. He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men. Yeah? You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either. True! Hello. If there are, we'll all be dead. Yes, some of the time. He's really very short on charm.As you wish... Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124. Now I think you ought to go to sleep. No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it. Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90. I don't understand. You want me to read this or not? -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up. It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse. All right, then. No more interruptions. ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen. Do you want me to go on with this? Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair. Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor. Someday, you may not mind so much. What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56. Because I can stop now if you want. The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered -- It was a very emotional time for Buttercup -- Keep your shirt on. Let me read. Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea. -- wait, just wait -- Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around. Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning? Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin. That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you. Open it up. I brought you a special present.He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK! What? Right, right, sorry. Where did you get that? Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had? We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back. Tilt his head back. Open his mouth. We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand. What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him. I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91. Have you any money? Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. -- Fezzik, please -- His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me -- Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace. To find the Man in Black, obviously. -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go -- No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black -- That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82. How many could you handle? Perhaps not. I feel fine. It's you. FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead? Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme. Probably he means no harm. You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life. No. Where's Fezzik? Now? Now? I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? -- Why? You can't even lift one. There we cannot help you. Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel. And it is guarded by sixty men. Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen. Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99. Your guess is as good as mine -- I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH! -- offer me everything I ask for -- -- power too -- promise me that -- -- offer me money -- Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. Thank you for everything. Humiliations galore! True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that. What's that? He's dead. He can't talk. I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years. This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation. Sixty-five. We're really in a terrible rush. Sir. Sir. He's already dead. Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years? Kill me quickly. Okay. I must know. Who are you?! Tell me. I ought to be after twenty years. I am not left-handed. Because I know something you don't know. I admit it -- you are better than I am. You are wonderful! Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro. Begin! You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you. You are ready, then? More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge. I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done. We'll wait until you're ready. You don't know any way you'll trust me? I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. I do not suppose you could speed things up? Sorry. Slow going? Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly. I want to duel him left-handed. You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means. My God! He's climbing. He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us. Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using. I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15. No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there. You're sure nobody's following us? Making sure nobody's following us.... as ... you ... wish... Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead? I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53. Does it bother you to hear? Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me? With pride. What can I do for you? Rest, Highness. "Are not capable of love" is what you mean. You admit to me you do not love your fiance? You think your dearest love will save you? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50. And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness. Catch your breath. They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder. I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know. Why should that make such a difference? Why is that, do you think? And a good thing too. Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people? I believe you -- So what happens now? I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either -- Get used to disappointment. No one of consequence. I am not left-handed either. There's something I ought to tell you. You're amazing! And what is that? Then why are you smiling? Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so. I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain -- You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die. Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30. Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday. You've done nothing but study swordplay? How old were you? Do you always begin conversations this way? Again. Thank you. Nothing comes to mind. No good. I've known too many Spaniards. That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. That does put a damper on our relationship. If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26. Thank you. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. You guessed wrong. What's so funny? Then make your choice. You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work -- You're just stalling now. Australia. Truly, you have a dizzying intellect. You've made your decision then7 What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man. Inhale this, but do not touch. Good. Then pour the wine. Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits. Yes. You're that smart? But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse. Perhaps an arrangement can be reached. Let me explain-Finish him, finish him. Your way. Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly. I'm waiting! -- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains. Faster! Veer left. Left. Left! No more rhymes now, I mean it. Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass. I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition. Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go! It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. Oh, have it your way. You know what a hurry we're in. He didn't fall? Inconceivable!! Inconceivable! Whoever he is, he's too late -- -- see? The Cliffs of Insanity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19. Go in, get after her! What? As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask? Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over- That would be inconceivable. You only think I guessed wrong -- -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool. I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours. I will. And I choose -- It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is. You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46. Wait till I get going! Where was I? Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. Hmm. I smell nothing. I accept. For the Princess? Morons. Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates? I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains. There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her! -- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43.You don't believe me? So it's to be torture. Then why bother curing me? Then I'm here till I die? Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness? Did you say, "I do"? It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117. It never happened. What hideous sin have you committed lately? Gently!! Gently. Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64. Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist... I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too. No. No. We have already succeeded. Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59. This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts. Singed a bit, were you? Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57. There will never be a need. Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while. I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me? Can you move at all? This is true love. You think this happens every day? Hear this now: I will come for you. Of course you will. As you wish. As you wish. Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why -- I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon. No. To the pain. DEATH FIRST!! It will not happen! Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts. In that case -- I thought he was with you. Light him. Not yet. True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside. Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak. And our assets? That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying. Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? -- I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.Lacy. . . I . . . You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one. Like me? I'm not so sure you do. I'm sorry to see you go. Gee, I'm really sorry. Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished. Oh . . . my . . . But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite. Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash. Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change. Gee, I don't think . . . Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story. I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do. If you say so. Here goes. Maybe I should sit this one out. Don't worry, I've got you. That sounds kind of pessimistic. Well, my career takes up a lot of my time. Oh . . . no, there's no one back home. No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand. Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom. I've never been in a place like this before. Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line. They make my eyes itch. And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty. I really don't think . . . Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . . . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse. You know him so well. But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is. Superman? Has something happened to him? It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . . . . . Please leave your message at the beep. Politely? 'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?' Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois. The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news. I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield. That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?Lucky I brought my drums. You think he'll find us. Ready, Uncle Lex? I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex. We'll all fry. Boy, are you gonna get it. What? Good. Let's hope he stays that way. Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed me down. You're just an experiment, freako! Hey! He looks . . . normal. You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex. The one Superman wrecked up? Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here? Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part. Superman broke your monster, Uncle Lex. Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer. Whoa. . . He missed the door, Uncle Lex. But why the hair? A toupee that flies? Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?Gee guys, that's swell of you. But . . . I've got another idea. If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it. Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave. Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man! And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again. Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . . that. Never. But we have to hide out for a while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan. If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring. Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband. This wasn't in the plan. My nephew, Leonard. He worships me. Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last. Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped. He's . . . cold. . . Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that could come in handy. What was that about? Hey! Just remember I made you. He's . . . beautiful. Perfect. There! Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me. Did you hear that? Oh Leonard . . . When I sent the remains of my last experiment . . . Get the box, nephew. I must have miscalculated. How. . . Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . . He has all of Superman's powers. If I've planned it right. . . Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious. That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic material. The building blocks of his body. With my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me! . . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate. Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair! Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman! Stop! I command you . . . you mutant! Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear? Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were? Nifty, huh? Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable Now, destroy Superman. Wait! Not yet! Back! I made you, and I can destroy you. What? A genius? . . . an inspiration? I hadn't counted on this but . . . . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ... For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on. But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized? But . . . how could you beat him? Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back. Superman. . . But you're... dead! Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive. Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world. I'll ignore that . . . So, I created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as I might have liked -- you were clearly his better -- he needed more energy, more power. No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman. Look closely at his cell structure. See anything familiar? Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block. Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . . Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call. I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look great! Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.I am master now. Destiny. What do you fear? First, I have fun. Destroy Superman! I am an experiment? I am freako? You are . . . nothing. I am father now. You are . . . What I need this for?Nothing is left but us. So had I. So did I. All the time. What difference does <i>that</i> make? Did you now. It was only a mouthful! H'm? Reprieve. In my pocket. I've got a present for you... Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan. Can you move over a wee bit? He'll be looking for another apprentice. I finished it off. I'm cold. Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while? Ah, come on now! Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible. Let me in. Living with him put years on me. You're only a young thing. I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it. Go away. Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell. That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells. Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain. What was <i>that</i> in aid of? She'll have to learn. Home is where the heart is. Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles. Didn't you know he made things? He made that. In his off hours. She got away. He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow? Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet. Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day? He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature. I carried you up to your bed. Curled up on the landing like love locked out! You're spoiling your pretty looks. Come here. Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids. Excuse me. There's not. You'll put your clothes here. There's no law, as I know of, to prevent it. You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away... Sounds like a french word, what is it? I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink? Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old. Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight. Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch. I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you. I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history... Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying! He's lying. ... That's what you told us to say. ...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day. ...you take that Anacott Steel? Wanna play some tennis Saturday? Great Charlie, any better it'd be a sin. ...not that you learned anything, Chunk. ...if I had your looks, better. ...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer? Now! Tell everyone to dump! Start unloading. I want to make it up to you. Bluestar, put all your clients in it. Get the hell out! Then get out and close it behind you. Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here? What's going on? Anacott Steel. Buy it. All right, I owe you one Marv. Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality... Marv, ...I just bagged the elephant! Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. ...gotta read my reports. Yeah, but he didn't see me. Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life. Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko? Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to you. You know what my dream is? One day to be on the other end of that phone... Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me. Thanks, Marv, with that I might be able to qualify for welfare. Joke about it. I was up all night charting these stocks. You want to see this or what? I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv. Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it. Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral. No, thanks, I'm nervous enough. Your words, not mine... Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me? Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please. That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself. Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants... ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking, you hear? Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday. ... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner? Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit. Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes... Alright. Why so pissed? Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the... The FAA announcement. You sure about this FAA announcement? Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all I can advise is hold on to that stock Dad... That's great Dad. ...Work okay? How's Mom? Not in here Dad... please. Later. Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise. It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 50 K don't get you to first base in the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of 15,000, I got school loans, car loans, food, park my car costs me 3 bills a month, I need good suits, that's $500 a pop, shoes... Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline. Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm. Coulda been a contender. D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me. Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss. It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date. ...thanks Natalie. It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get. ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko. Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me... Good. Then call him back. And call me back. Don't worry. Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing. They won't. That's not their jurisdiction. Tell 'em your father gave it to you. Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment. What'd you tell him? No, no Dixon, my client wants to buy a large, large block of stock and needs to spread it around. I'll park some money in your account and if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm telling you, this is the easiest money you ever made... It's ready to take off. I'd jump all over it if I were you. Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share. Let's see, it closed at uh, 41 1/8... Up a quarter...very attractive... about average yield... Like? Uh...hmmm. Well... So, where are we going? We are? Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure. Would you, uh, like to come in? He never told me... Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool. ....Relax Roget You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this... So what's the problem? ...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger. More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer? Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know. Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another. What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal? Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over. "What are you thinking?"...that was it. The hours are hell, but the money's starting to tumble in. I know this guy who's got an iron- clad way to make money, I can't lose and I can't get hurt. Nah, she asked the wrong question. Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie? Gordon. Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide. ...I can't make it tonight. Obviously... How much is enough Gordon? Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough? If these people lose their jobs, nowhere to go. My father worked at Bluestar for twenty-four years. I gave 'em my word. Why do you need to wreck this company? Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me. I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why? I'm sorry, this can't wait. Now, wait a minute, Dad... And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt. I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts. The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air... Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside. Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune! Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility... ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker... I think I got some friends that won't mind making some easy money... How much? ...Gordon. Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%. "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate. The break up value is higher. It's worth 80. I guess I'll head back... Sorry, Mr. Gekko. My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow. ...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill. I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more. What about hard work? Follow him? Mr. Gekko I... It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it? I don't understand. I remember that deal. You were involved? 'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders. Yes... What? How do you know about my father? Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little loss today. We got stopped out on Tarafly... ...about 50 thousand. Nice club, Mr. Gekko... Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on. Excuse me sir. Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner. No sir, that would've been illegal... Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell... ...I can't even see it... Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko. My home number's on the back... I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop. There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know. A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities... Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management. Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko. ...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff. Jackson, Steinem... I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you... Oh no, no... How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox. Why? Get the hell out! I'm looking...and I sure don't like what I see. You really mean that? What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien... What the hell's that supposed to mean? I can stay with the brokerage firm. And you're doing fine. We can survive without Gordon Gekko. At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger. I'm not gonna let it happen Darien. Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people... Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express... ... and you're going along for the ride. ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded... Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side. I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours? You think I'm gonna broker the rest of my life... I'm going to be a giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in the Italian 15th century sense of the word -- a mover, shaker. Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius! Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching... It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world. ...right here...make love to me...now... Stop me if I'm going too far. That's right -- one with high yield, rich assets and no downside... I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise. Sure... But your fee... considering you're way over budget, should be negotiable. You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn. ...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. You're not trouble by any chance. Are you? Well, why stop at that? And what do you want? The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us. Yeah, almost... How would I know? I once bet a horse. He went out at ten to one and came in at quarter to five. Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown? Only if I want something bad enough. So. See you Friday. You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you. Break it. Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo. Upper West Side. Well, if you're that good, you could probably do wonders at my place. I gather you're a decorator. Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here. You could have a great beach house for that. ...few thousand dollars down the drain if you ask me. Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this? Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together. Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink. Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks. Oh Christ! ...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent... ...how do you know? You wish... Any better and I'd be guilty. Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin... ...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim. It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things. Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing. Anacott Steel. Old values. Buy. Sleep with me and the secrets of the West are yours. You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others... I guess it's time to hit the road. Another cup of coffee? You speak for me, son. I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them! ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent... Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father. What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it. I met them before you were born. Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here. Whatever night you like. Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks. What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes. ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans. Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month... What's this? I gave you two hundred. Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money? Don't start, alright. What brings you out here... Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that mischievous look in your eyes. You used to smile just like that when you were a baby sleeping, just like that. About what? Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now. ...this drug testing is driving my guys nuts. I got flagged for my blood pressure pills. The only good news is, we just met with the comptroller over some union stuff...'member that crash last summer? and the investigation? Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was a manufacturing flaw in the door latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em it wasn't maintenance, it was those goddamn greedy manufacturers out in Cincinnati. And I was right. ...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it. ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never... ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow... ...Got a 100 on me, you... It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need? So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you... I don't get it, you get a scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000 the first year, and 50 last year, where the hell is it? You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman. you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman. I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer, Speak English will ya. ... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me. ...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti... ...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day... No, it's a prophecy. The rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time. The only difference between the Pyramids and the Empire State Building is that the Egyptians didn't have unions. I know what this guy is about-- greed--he's in and out for the buck and he don't take prisoners. He don't give a damn about Northstar or us ... There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know. I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?Sell it all. What the hell, so I'll only make ten million. Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter. Tell those spineless toads we'll self-insure if they don't write it... You fire 33 vice presidents and nothing changes... You eating twinkies today, Bud, or are you schtupping some stewardess... If I ever need surgery, get me the heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's never been used...Happy Holideals Harold... Look Harold, they're vulnerable, alright, but we don't want 'em to think they're under accumulation. Go slow. Call Geneva and the Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint towards it but we wait... You sandbagged me on Bluestar. I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh? Hello Bud. Dump it. Are you with me Buddy? Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien... The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip. We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it... ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you... Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest. It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation... Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life. Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind. You're walking around blind without a cane, sport. A fool and his money are lucky to get together in the first place. Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung. What the hell do you want? I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning. Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain. A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox. Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen... So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more... What makes you think you can? What does that mean? I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake. Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry Wildman going off a cliff in my new Maserati. Men as smart as myself have got their asses handed to them on a sling with the airlines, fuel could go up, unions are killers... The art of which is deception. Spread the buy orders through different accounts and you won't get burned... Close to two million. But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals. Got him at an auction in Kentucky. Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work. You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line. Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment. ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on. Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out. You're learning, sport... He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs. But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72. Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox. Allright. Wait here... ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it. ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up. You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now. I'll be right there, fix them a drink. Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand? What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...?? Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that? I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business... Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture... Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport. ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world... Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired... Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight. Know the name? The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that? I guess your father's not a union representative on that company. Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people! ...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself... ...come on sport, you gotta try harder, I need some exercise for chrissake... ...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious. Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account? Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for yourself? Bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office. ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today. See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen... Hi sport. Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one. How do you know? ...don't like airlines, lousy unions... ...rings a bell somewhere. So what? It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport? So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here? ...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know? ...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal. So what firm you with, pal? Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor. So what s on your mind kimosabe? Why am I listening to you? Got to monitor my blood pressure, so whatever you do, don't upset me. So you say. Nice to meet you; hope you're intelligent. Like these, how'd you get these? Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground. I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb? Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen. Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you? Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of. You and I are the same, Darien. We're smart enough not to buy into the oldest myth running: love... A fiction created by people who got nothing to keep them from jumping out of windows. Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit. Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding. I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay? Now tell me, why would I want to do that? You told him about us? Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power. So what's the problem Sunshine? You look like Black Thursday. Bad case of puppy love? Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought. What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine. Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor. Interesting. You got a card? Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie. He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business. Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red. Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested. Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way! Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50. You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline... The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid... Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured. Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest! You guys must know something nobody else knows. If those are my plans, it's the first I've heard of it. Cards are on the table. What do you think? I'll have a letter of agreement drawn up within two days. Cause I have a way around all this, a way we can all make money and make this airline profitable again. What do you say we cut to the chase. I'm asking for a modest twenty percent across-the-board wage cut.Sell? The stock's going to Pluto! Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back. Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do work wonders. I agree. Go thou and sin no more. You know what you need, buddy buddy--an optorectomy. That's when they cut the nerve that runs from your brain to your rectum--to change that shitty attitude of yours. Hey the door was open. Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk. Lynch is giving him the boot... He's not pulling his quota. What the hell... That's right, next time a little birdie talks to you, talk to me too E.F. Hutton. Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar Airlines yesterday. Today they just happen to get good news and the stock goes bat shit. You must have ESP. A real Nostradamus. Jesus Christ, what are friends for? Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar. Got a little action there, eh buddy? Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his equity when his firm went belly up in the recession of 71. you wanna be coming in here in your late sixties still pitching? ... Whatever happened to that cute analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ... Cindy? Susan? Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there. ...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say? Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle. ...well, see him? It concerns his future! Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short. Just put me on the institutional side of the room where the real cheesecake is. You forgetting something? Hey, things could be worse. It could've been my money. Let me help you out, rookie. Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today. Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down. Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest. Yeah, where's your machine gun.
