thank you i see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it because they felt so silly i have no idea well not quite a bloodthirsty mob that was weird i guess leaving was the best idea come on im freezing i dont know lets see if theres an inn or something up the road come on jack shall we go jack wed better go you ask them wrong i see you want me to ask these people if theyre burning candles to ward off monsters you ask them maybe the owners are from texas what about it listen at least its warm in here hello shall we i assume full responsibility a severed wolfs head on a pike as their symbol of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed wolfs head on a spear as their symbol of course the slaughtered lamb why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol weve known debbie what since the eighth grade how many years of foreplay is that it just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull if you dont stop im going to kill you i dont know im talking about a girl you want to fuck so give me a break shes a jerk i think debbie klein is a mediocre person with a good body right well i like it here youre not having a good time are you jack yesi doubt it but its something to do nurse hobbs said theres a disturbance in leicester square involving some sort of mad dog tea would be nice i expect you shortly shall i send a car youre certain hes lucid you wont need any help right now listen carefully i want you to bring david here i want him in my care ill notify the police that weve found him it is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital do you understand could you get here without any trouble is david acting strangely have you read the papers today have you listened to the radio or television the zoo is he rational is he all right why didnt you call me where was he lets call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy oh i dont mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon but in such a deranged state he could harm himself or perhaps others david has suffered a severe trauma i myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in east proctor if all the villagers believe that jack goodman was killed by a werewolf why shouldnt david and then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf wouldnt he himself become a werewolf the next full moon youve absolutely no idea where david might be i think the village of east proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret im convinced that like david they believe in this werewolf they were lying there were no witnesses no escaped lunatic the whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there i tried to investigate the attack there are no records the case was closed and now theyve misplaced the file davids lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before i did the goodman boy is already in the ground so hes no good to us so i went to the pub in east proctor where i was convinced of two things warn him what did he say has his friend appeared to him again alex has david persisted in his werewolf fantasies its a full moon where is he oh dear girl your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me i dont give a damn who you sleep with im concerned about david come to my office miss price did he say a wolf the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them he must have been a very powerful man although i really dont see that it is any of your concern miss price that would be jack goodman the boy who was killed what exactly did he call out oh miss price go about your duties can i be of service miss price miss gallagher surely you must perform some function here at the hospital of course not david ill fetch in young miss price believe me the hound of the baskervilles was an invention of sir arthur conan doyles and if youd read the bloody book youd find that holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud a fake david please the police are satisfied im certain that if a monster were out roaming northern england wed have seen it on the telly i really dont know no in fact your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here youd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of yes did you get a good look at the man who attacked you youve never had bad dreams before in time im sure it will all come back to you so they said now weve just given you a pretty strong sedative so try to get some rest now miss price will see to your needs rest now youve suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises lost a bit of blood but nothing too serious black and blue for a while youll have some dueling scars to boast of that lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow they say a mad man has the strength of ten youve been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago miss price miss price please now david i want you to prepare yourself your friend is dead i should think so after your recent traumatic experiences youre in a hospital in london hello david i am dr hirsch and this is a countryman of yours mr collins what can we do to assist you regardless of what you think lieutenant the fact remains that david is missing and that we must find him why dont we ask him you were saying well then what can i do for scotland yard come in come in please sit some tea tell him im out no tell him ive passed away an old war wound or something tell him im dead and no more calls what here excuse me yes send them in yes i see youve heard nothing about the incident whats that i suppose guinness will suffice campari and soda would do nicelyif you did it wrong it would be painful youd choke to death because this must be stopped gerald is the man you murdered in the subway we thought it best you didnt see him as hes a fresh kill and still pretty messy david kessler this is gerald bringsly i want you to meet some people what about the zoo thank you if i was still alive i probably would you dont have to say anything hi david the canines will be real youll taste real blood god damit david please believe me youll kill and make others like me im not having a nice time david dont allow this to happen again you must take your own life you must believe me what do you think you must take your own life now david before its too late david tomorrow night is the full moon youll change youll become yes david im sorry i upset you yesterday but you must understand what is going on i wanted to see you dont be an asshole david come here its cold david and im so alone the undead surround me have you ever talked to a corpse its boring im lonely kill yourself david before you kill others the supernatural the powers of darkness its all true take your own life suicide david join me listen to me take your own life david its our only chance david please believe me you will kill people david youve got to stop the bloodshed before it begins youll stalk the streets of london a creature of the night beware the moon the full moon david youve got two days remember what that guy at the slaughtered lamb said beware the moon you survived and now you shall continue the curse its you david the wolfs bloodline must be severed the last remaining werewolf must be destroyed i was murdered an unnatural death and now i walk the earth in limbo until the werewolfs curse is lifted on the moors we were attacked by a lycanthrope a werewolf we were attacked by a werewolf im a grisly sight its true but i love you and thats why im here youve got to know david now i know this may be hard for you but i have to warn you david life mocks me even in death so you know what she does shes so grief stricken she runs to find solace in rudy levines bed debbie klein cried a lot yeah your parents came to my funeral i was surprised at how many people came im sorry to be upsetting you david but i had to come david youre hurting my feelings im aware that i dont look so great but i thought youd be glad to see me thanks a lot nice to see you you really scared me you shithead ill tell you when we get there yeah not far enough come on no walking away yes sir here we are walking away nice doggie good boy oh shit what is that do you think its a dog plan its circling us come on where shit david what is that i vote we go back to the slaughtered lamb its a full moon beware the moon heathcliffe didnt howl pecos bill there arent any coyotes in england yeah what was it did you hear that say david maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural what do you think was wrong i dont know now that were out here and its three degrees im not so sure i wouldnt rather face a bloodthirsty mob beware the moon what the hell was that all about apparently so what do you mean im starving go on ask them right listen thats a pentangle a five pointed star its used in witchcraft lon chaney jr and universal studios maintain its the mark of the wolf man ask them what the candles are for its a fivepointed star look at that nice looking group nice to see you okay david before we go in there i want you to know that no matter what happens to us its your fault thats not a spear its a pike thats a wolfs head the slaughtered lamb she says she likes me too much it is impossible for a body like that to be dull i have to make love to her its very simple she has no choice really rendezvous in rome starring jack goodman and debbie klein the love affair that shocked europe see torrid lovemaking at its most explicit see jack and debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the vatican never has the screen dared well anyway do you think shell be there youre talking about the woman i love debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time do you think

grant you your wish if you grant lady guenevere hers im going i didnt know leondegrance had a daughter but i have to leave tomorrow the forests are thick with rebels invaders plunder our shores yeit is the old wound that has been opened i have always known it would be the gateway to my death for it has never healed let my heart do its job my king and pump me empty my salvation is to die a knight of the round table arthur it is deep but one can still keep a sword sharp riding out in the name of the kings law only give me leave to ride out again to do what i am most able to do and happiest doing these men repented before god for their evil deeds those who would not met their fate at the end of my sword accept the fruit of my first quest as my wedding gift we spared the lives of a few so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of king arthurs knights my domain is here inside this metal skin and i would pledge to you all that i still own muscle bone blood and the heart that pumps it i gave up my castles and my lands then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place i the best knight in the world bested this is a great day for my search is over i love you my king it is you sir who knows not the virtue of humility as a true king must sir your rage has unbalanced you it seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy for a length of road you can ride around i sought only not to harm you sir yield i have the advantage i will not you must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms under the eyes of god not a boast sir but a curse never have i met my match in joust or duel i am sir lancelot of the lake from across the sea i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom and i look for the king who is worthy of my swords service i await the king himself his knights are in need of training good day to you sir the king without his sword the land without a king why didnt he kill us there are things about love the law forbids it i can not love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my king and my friend and in pledging my love to you i can not love any other woman yes i would swear my love to you you there is one i am a fighting man and i am married to the quest that is enough no it must wait child these good ladies for whom i intervened once will honor me with a meal i am beholden to them now as i was when they begged my protection listen boy its more than twenty days from here very well climb up just a man a knight in the kings servicestories you brought me back your love brought me back back to where you are now in the land of dreams but im here it is like a tree the roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree and the stars whisper back to men the future course of events but the earth is being torn apart its metals stolen and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge in fact i nearly didnt make it in one piece i know i have heard noises and echoes through the stones i can not i must not here i must stay you betray the boy who drew the sword the boy who saw the dragon the dragon who moves close by coiling and uncoiling restless looking down waiting for the king to be a king my powers fade arthur i resort to cheap tricks yes i enjoy every moment of my foolishness i join in the making of it so no one can betray me but you you betray yourself that is my destiny i have a destiny too what the greatest they blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword a king should be afraid always the enemy is everywhere waiting in ambush in the dark corridors of his castle on the deer paths of his forest or in the gray and winding paths of a more tangled forest in here yes what is it my child never where you expect it thats all i know good and evil there is never one without the other at your service sir the knights of galys approach the camp it would be politic the lady of the lake take it take it quickly come now so much anger for such a little crime are you sure there is nothing else troubling you i had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so i could get some honey and i didnt feel up to using any more magic just yet anyway i was in less danger than youll be in today youre not listening your heart is not love is deaf as well as blind guenevere and a beloved friend who will betray you there are maidens as fair and fairer than guenevere if i put my mind to it i could see them now many of them weeping for love of you watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles offering you their every favor rich cleverbut if it is to be guenevere so be it a king must marry after all whats this whats this the dragon there the book without pages open before you all around us you can see it in bits and pieces for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance why it would burn him to cinders in the great book because you must you and only you have you forgotten that it was you who freed excalibur thank you well there you dont need me half as much as you think you do you already know what must not happen it is whispered in the forest that leondegrances castle is under siege by lot and uryens help me help me help me get up thats not why you came but not from your destiny you are the son of king uther and the fair igrayne you are king arthur speak of the devil i am the sea which covers the desert forever under its weight i am the cloudburst that quenches the flames whats behind that beauty a wizened coldhearted snake what do you want you must desire it for me to weave it i wont you would misuse such power i have paid enough for you and i will have you flattery do you think i am ignorant of your stupid little games preying on you weakness of others thats your power a petty evil mine is great great plans impossible dreams laughable endings they do when arthur built the castle i carved out a place for myself where i could laugh or sleep and no one would bother me that i can not maybe maybe i showed you all my conjuring tricks shh yes yes sit with me please morgana no yes i am i am jealous i want to write poems about you with moonbeams make the sea sing your name im not jealous no no of course not you are young it is you left your husbands side you left your brothers wedding they are not weapons my friend but truths you betrayed the duke stole his wife and took his castle now no one trusts you lot uryens your allies will turn against you give me the child uther i will protect him go back to your war tent maybe not even that uther i thought once that you were the one to unite the land under one sword but itll take another a greater king its not for you uther hearth and home wife and child you didnt ask the child is mine uther i have come for him now you must pay me doing what i did for you it wasnt easy you know it takes its toll it took nine moons to get back my strength what issues from your lust will be mine swear it again i have walked my way since the beginning of time sometimes i give sometimes i take it is mine to know which and when behold the sword of power excalibur before uther it belonged to lud before lud to beowulf before beowulf to baldur the good before baldur to thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow speak the words just show the sword its done a truce we meet at the river
