383 to the goddamn housekeeper what the fuck is your problem how much wheres the rest sixteen dollars thats not correct youre so spoiled what is not good to you only a few hundred you cant just run home every time things get tough first of all weve got enough dough to dont panic anthony bob taught you how to get electrocuted you dont know how to hotwire no one to back me up now i have a good idea so unless you come up with something better look im ready to get the fuck out of here its real torture for me to be here getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans she doesnt need to know i know we can its real simple we go into a room grab some car keys and inez has a master key to all these rooms doesnt she doesnt she i have an idea for that i dont really feel like talking about it the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place would of been nice can you hand me those french fries ok no im going to swim ill see you later well the world is a little bit colder today if youd gone with bob youd probably be in weatherford by now of course id be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob id be dead so when you were saying bobs at the store and acting real surprised that was just an act you were just if you wanted to go what were you going to do just leave me here by myself he told you and you let him do it where was i whend he tell you we said 48 hours he took his stuff hes gone i should of seen this i should of expected it bob doesnt have any character that coward son of a bitch right here hes gone he stole the car yes its true they blamed my family for everything they always said mr langston saved anthonys life mr langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation cpr ive never said this before but frankly i thought anthony was dead the veins in his face were all sticking out his skin was blue he truly did look dead see one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr langstons house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious i had to dive in and save him see now weve got a plan obviously thats a given now that makes sense well hang out for a couple of days get a little rr make sure future mans ok and then get back on the road he needs to hire an attorney no kidding which one was that they dont anthony were on the run from the law here did you tell these people your real name what the fuck is going on here may i have a word with you please jerry and this is my associate cornelius hi no we didnt even if its the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not then youre going to have to dye it anthony weve got to hide our identities especially after bob crashed the car true actually if you knew the exact route you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over right get back to me on that one once your plan is worth a shit armored trucks are very difficult to steal anthony no im not saying her im just saying i dont know you owe me fifty bucks on your marks get set go ill say it you were spoiled rotten thats real cool anthony yeah i wore boots my parents wouldnt buy me any 200 running shoes like yours i wasnt spoiled really ok dad but seriously anthony these are fast shoes well those treads stink youd blow a knee out racing on those what about them yes they are see if mine are in there anthony were on the run this is an emergency its only fair that well then cut it in half shes not going to notice anthony why not can i get that credit card from you i didnt realize you were so sensitive to bobs feelings considering i did the plans youre actually lucky you got anthony he sat in the car and watched a 411 in progress he got what he deserved whats wrong with him like im going to hunt you down and kill you yeah i swear to god in a very quiet voice oh shit that was scary in the middle of the robbery the manager looks at me right in the eye and goes im going to remember you we got it we got it unlock that door check the aisles we know theres another stocker wheres the other stocker youre right youre right youre out im not working with either one of you anthony give me the fucking gun now one thing we need to discuss is timing timing is absolutely crucial what are you doing anthony thats a good question no i dont im just being hypocritical here however i will say ok escape route the most important thing you can have is an escape route just in case somebodys tailing us or even chasing us as the case may be loop around real fast yeah hang on a second thats not bad holy shit whatd i tell you yeah i heard that no just do it real quick ill meet you down there i dont think so just reach on in im lookout did you see that youre making fun of my family you know theres nothing to steal from my mom and craig you know exactly what youre saying i dont appreciate you ridiculing me yeah but i cant be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary theres just not time for it every valuable item in the house was on that list i know about money anthony i know the value of money plus the earrings are worth three times that anthony well get two hundred for the coin collection alone thats less than what its appraised at what do you think the cops have shes an attractive older woman see your mind is very good with the more mechanical details whereas my strength would be would they do that kind of except weve already got the keys this is he what does starsky say see thats what im saying it has the logic of a dream why i think you might of dreamed this one anthony plus wheres huggie bear ok thats wrong making hutch david soul what color hair does he have bob get back in position true well this isnt really a party per se mr henry pulled that job in 1965 its famous applejack was the wheel man did you use this same car applejack wait did he see us looks like hes staying with buckethead thats what i figured hes probably got his own room lets see where hes going yeah thats anthony wait a second we might have to take that chance cause i feel pretty strongly about this just settling an old score you might say revenge theres a lot of valuable shit in there applejack the silver and the china the crystal and the grandfather clock goddammit i bet that clocks worth ten grand now here we go i dont really want to talk about it bob no i have a cellmate his names carl we dont have rooms bob we have cells thats just what the da asked crs is a disease where you cant remember shit i said to the da that cop

know its not future man would never go to jail for you ill tell you that dont threaten me bob i cant do that bob good luck since i got the keys not in that car youre not dont come on dignan me this could be a trap bob that makes no sense what do you mean get back then how come they havent set the bail yet thats unconstitutional how long has he been in there so tell them the truth what do you use it for since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house everybody has a scale that could be anybodys i dont think they can make it stick bob i mean what do they actually have on future man but its not his how can they arrest future man what are you talking about you can go first bob bob are you coming what the fuck possessed you im sure he did well have to get new plates i dont know shit bob what the fuck did you do that for in all probability nothing would of happened but why take the chance thats why i ran i mean how many plants were even back there five ten so its my fault way to

tape on his nose no i was calm dont count it be cool bob be cool make that light thats good keep it at forty shhh slow down bob drive natural im putting a piece of tape on my nose you know when somebody gets electrocuted their skin starts smoking at least swiftys did yeah one of the nicest old guys youd ever know it was an accidental i dont want to go into the details it was just one of those senior pranks that didnt really go right i mean obviously since swiftys dead thats why anthony never graduated you know bob anthony did kill someone he electrocuted our janitor senior year well

dont do nothin stupid and well all get along fine scotty you sure you dont want a drinkunderstand i had help very well the jobs still yours ill go but if i have to return youre finished and i will then do everything i can to destroy your reputation am i not fair told you youd hate me im going to try and locate redbeard i assume youve heard of him let me explain about time youve been here three months and already two months behind and the germans and the french are gearing up and i dont care about you and i dont care about the thirty dead i care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule ill get my knighthood and i want it professional hunters may be the answer i made a mistake hiring you youre simply not up to the job and it worked are you running a high fever man how could you expect something as lunatic as this to succeed how could you even conceive of it genius the beast will enter tripping the wire the door will slide down trapping him you safe behind the bars will have him at your mercy and will shoot him this is supposed to be salvation what kind of idiocy are we dealing with here what have they done besides kill starling how many have they killed whats the surprise in that this is africa well i need to speak to him awhile back he ordered some bibles ive brought them is he here i do need to see starling but overall youre pleased so work must be going well lovely sound they seem happy how could it be i hate africa very moving patterson im touched you confided in me but i dont really give a shit about your upcoming litter ive made you with this assignment dont make me break you youll need your confidence i promise you youve never built in africa build the bridge over the tsavo river and be finished in four months time can you do that games look at me closely patterson i am a monster my only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me such as yourself one mistake and i promise you this ill make you hate me john henry patterson come in im robert beaumont firm i like that tells me a lot about you now why dont you tell me about me to get you started many people find me handsome with a wonderful smile im sure you agree winning personality heaps of charmcareful abdullah i wasnt and you know it and dont push it just listen we have a problem in tsavo thats ridiculous talk and you cant seriously believe it morning friend glorious day you think so fine its best you get out go tell all your people to go run home where theyll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here they were the only ones to flee he sees this chaos hell replace you all you think you matter beaumont is on that train he matters oh sing a different song abdullah theres nothing wrong with your men so stop telling me there is there is no reason for fear let me see the sick you were contracted to work not a time for modesty bob every man whos ever fired a rifle has heard of him by the time you find him the lions will be dead all theyll bring is more chaos and weve plenty of that already and if they come in word will get out and what happens to your knighthood then you genuinely enjoy trying to terrify people dont you well fine except there isnt a higher rated engineer and we both know that and since time is so important to you how long do you think it would take to find someone else qualified and bring him here what in point of fact it didnt but im convinced the theory is sound i didnt conceive of it for the lions i built one in india when there was trouble with a tiger in that half will be bait human bait ill start things off a sliding door will fit above that and a trip wire will run across the floor im calling it my contraption were going to surround it with a boma a fence to you and were going to leave a small opening opposite that door it hasnt been that simple so far its what the natives are calling the lions two lions have been causing trouble yes he is starling truthfully there has been the occasional odd hiccup but then as you so wisely told me id never built in africa dont they though pleasant journey you wont have the chance any further words of encouragement then ive a train to catch ive got a reason far beyond confidence my wife is having our firstborn in five months and i promised id be with her when the baby comes but i have in india every country presents problems im sure youve examined my record so you know ive never yet been late on a bridge my wife is the game player in the family sir you dont enjoy killing do you karim will have to show me where it happened and of course ill need the donkey with any luck ill sort it out tonight then why do you stay i am desperate to see africa but i hate the leaving what if there are complications well its just other men dont abandon their wives at such a time it was embarrassing the man showered me with compliments were not much good at goodbyes helena well of course he kept moving but he couldnt have been more than ten feet away from the three of you surely you must have wounded the thing not once you didnt hit it once all right youll spend your nights inside youll have plenty of ammunition youre totally protected you have really nothing to fear very good indeed you mean nobody died but its crazy the lion shouldnt be that hungry this soon samuel second death where thats what the books say ill try but this feels so different that old lion i killed could never carry off a man singhs size nigel youll just have to use your hands in your honor nigel and you and singh will be in charge of building them and youll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars and youll be finished in eight thrilling weeks all right thee second embankment will go there possibly how lucky we are true enough but without the comedy relief so thats what a lion looks like not to terrify you nigel but its worse than you think ive never even seen one what youll have to deal with it nigel shhh id love the company and ive hunted all my life might be exciting for you we know three things about maneaters first they always return to where theyve attacked before second theyre always old they cant catch other animals so they turn to us and third theyre always alone theyve been cast out by their pride because they cant keep up well he put me in a spot didnt he but thats all right after all im responsible for everything that happens here and it certainly wont do much for morale if a maneaters on the prowl and anxious to get started what is this mostly malaria excellent could i see the bridge site does he speak english have you got that in writing beaumont says its to end slavery almost three hours but ive been getting ready all my life just that they fart through their mouths must make kissing something of a gamble the females are bigger only animal here like that have to be or they wouldnt survive because the males eat the young he just gave me his monster speech actually i could have done it much more easily without you but for whatever reason im glad you came i never thought id say this but im glad you came how many do you think theyve killed why you think theyll come then why was that supposed to make me feel better ill have to ill be bait alone theyre used to people in trees not in a clearing it may be tight where could it have gone how could it get across the water theyre only lions yes their den have you ever seen anything like this what happened to them you just got hit the getting up is up to you but theyre only lions and im going after them crack of dawn but of course yours worked goddammit have you ever failed dont know misfire it jammed it was probably luck id rather you did the shooting i can try have you got it thats very considerate somehow i guessed actually no we need to talk got me out of trouble i didnt have a chance to thank you its all right samuel we all get hit where is it he has children i feel the same about the bridge this country certainly didnt ask for it doesnt need it thank you why does he need you by him youve known him long you like him dont you i have to ask why do you need me i do actually very much i expect so its from my wife thank you samuel look out samuel here it comes fine get started and a strict curfew no one allowed out at night send half your men to the bridge the rest with these two and im sorry for my tone earlier but i repeat there is no reason for fear i will kill the lion and i will build the bridge nonsense what are they looking at clearly you dont agree about building the railroad this is more difficult the workers dont get on its all wonderfully under control samuel youve done a splendid job why do the workers look unhappywell have to make them come to us wont we and since there are two of them were going to set two plans in motion first we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night starting now we attack them excellent decision your name is abdullah im sure well meet again go and enjoy the splendid morning am i to take it you want to live youre right the devil has come look at me i am the devil no hints samuel then we agree i suppose i could answer you i suppose i could explain that the place is so inviting what with the smell of blood and flesh that they have to strike its even possible that i tell you i found some fresh paw marks around back which means theyre already contemplating feasting here but i dont want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that i dont have the least idea what i am doing that i am nothing but an incompetent that i am a fool anyone who finds me a fool please say so now is it im sorry but then of course youre the doctor you should know understood you realize now you could never have done it without me the most of any lions a hundred probably more johnny because i think theyre after you good luck its certainly the best chance theyve had to kill you i cant control mine id be lost without the shame factor driving me yes and ill be in some distant tree where i can provide no assistance whatsoever can you control your fear not for me im too bulky and its your idea you go up there take the others to the water tower for the night dont they have to be nobodys seen anything like this lions dont have caves like this theyre doing it for pleasure i got big in my town when i was little there was a brute a bully who terrorized the place but he was not the problem he had a brother who was worse than he but the brother was not the problem one or the other of them was usually in jail the problem came when they were both free togther the two became different from either alone alone they were only brutes together they became lethal together they killed it would have been a beautiful bridge john i never noticed before occupied with other business i suppose never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but ive had the time today nothing else on and this its graceful and the placement couldnt be prettier and in point of fact it didnt but im convinced the idea is sound meant to ask you the railroad car trap your idea excellent notion i used the same device myself once its all right stay ready they know its there only in life think about something else has it ever done that before youd never force the lion to me and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck around theres a clearing youll know it from the anthills get there and hide and listen to the sounds ill make the lion come directly to you samuel says you killed a lion the best way to ensure the kill when youre using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter have you ever led trackers no but you do see you were needed after all and fifty warriors at the camp before dawn im always considerate my mother taught me that i dont really but understand something even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out when im gone youll still have to build the bridge and i dont want the men to have lost respect for you all right lets go into battle im redbeard let me save time you are the engineer you are in charge youre sorry im here right so far good because i am not an engineer i dont want to be in charge and im sorrier than you are that im here i hate tsavo so i will help you by killing the lions and leaving and you will help me by doing what i tell you so i can leave see any problems nonsense samuel would have done something what did i do hold your son high my life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder our lives have crossed because two lions went mad but what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity was that worth all the lives too soon to tell some russian princes want to hunt the himalayas you patterson and i will be in the old hospital where the enticing smell of sickness still lingers and by the time were done i promise you the odor of blood will be irresistible gentlemen theres no sickness smell at all here and little blood when we leave close the gate securely dont open it til morning and keep your fires high any questions ask them now you two will sleep beautifully in your tents and stay there not even close what happened because i have two plans to kill the lions one involving the cattle the other the men four should do it why do you laugh you dont believe she taught meafraid of lions underneath somewhere once three years ive worked for the railroad now i dont know why it seemed a good idea once he doesnt he needs nobody but we have hunted many times he knows i am afraid of lions since his beard was red oh yes but it takes time soon you give me hope john do you love her good news for you oh yes i think so we should construct thorn fences around every tent area fires burning at night you dont know what tsavo means do you it means slaughter you they can not believe youre still here i am also liaison between these two did it look like this in your mind get on they detest each other obviously the africans hate the indians but the indians also hate the other indians some of them worship cows while others eat them thank you the truth is this you have to work at it constantly because they are here because tsavo is the worst place in the world come john to the bridge some mysteries should not have solutions help finish the railroad where do you go next and where will you sleep beautifully did you ever see a lion that size why so many they will want a lot of money how many cattle i dont believe you had a motherplease you neednt be so graphic a maneater attacks and youre such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it you never had it we all worked together worthy deeds were accomplished i liked the labor my mother insisted on piano lessons broke the dear womans heart when i turned out to be tone deaf but she still was always at me about being careful with my hands i like the blood is that strange what a good week far end of camp man wandering alone at night hawthornes examining the body now theres even less of him than of singh but you said they were always old john it will not be easy you do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just there arent we full of ourselves today i think its because of the lion with much more on the way john we could have had this chat on flatter ground one shot since youd only been here three hours when we met are you sure this is how you hunt lions john i know this isnt the time to ask but that is precisely my plan but back in my tent im sure you mean that to be comforting but i hate to be a bother john but the cramps getting worse the pain is actually quite unbearable now well why not you seem so calm and experienced why not indeed ive never been all that adventurous i wouldnt be in the way i dont suppose i could watch you said of course youd need the donkey why of course i couldnt believe it when you said sort it out as if it were the most normal thing in the world hohum what lovely tea i think ill bag a killer beast this evening nothing much else going on anyway yes but their suffering is only transitory once they except god into their hearts he will vanquish all pain finish your tour ive got medical supplies to deliver come along to the hospital when youre done samuel is camp liaison absolutely indispensable the only man here everyone trusts we all have our reasons mine is simply to make them understand happiness accept salvation know the serenity that comes best i stop one of the byproducts of my belief is that i can become amazingly boring but i know god smiles on me every time i see something like that i know were right to be here to bring christianity into their lives enrich their souls ive lived in africa a year and i dont know what you know how long have you been here anything special about them dont much like them that i know robert seems dreadful but when you truly get to know the man well hes much worse and im one of his defenders forget him for now its your first ride to tsavo i think youll find it breathtaking many thanks youre patterson yes nigel starling ill be assisting you at tsavo but surely beaumont must have told you thatdid it work if anything goes wrong ill have to think quickly adjust the signal who knows well be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off better be you left me for him you still believe in him a toast to the end of the world just my luck no ice you cant be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons hes not going to listen to me i want you to leave with us right now fifty six minutes forty five seconds walk to the window right in front of you connie dont hang up its not paranoia the embedding is very subtle its probably been overlooked ive worked with embedded loading theyre communicating with a hidden signal theyre going to attack you dont understand you have to leave washington you have to leave the white house checkmate think its like in chess first you strategically position your pieces then when the timings right you strike that signal its a countdown remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction just do it tell her to get the kids and leave town whatre you talking about strange thing is if my calculations are right itll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway the signal reduces itself every time it recycles eventually it will disappear are you listening ive got a lock on the signal pattern we can filter it out yes because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas we should be able to block out the overlay completely no the good news is i found the problem and its not our equipment theres some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed youre in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch theres good news and bad news lets retrofit the dish to another satellite did you try to switch to transponder channels what the hell is this it was turned on i was ignoring you whats the big emergency thanks pops a cold of course pops youre a genius weve got ta burn the rain forest pops dump toxic waste pollute the air rip up the ozone maybe if we screw this planet up enough they wont want it anymore im making a mess dad please moishe please dont talk he wasnt the president then because last time i saw him i punched him in the face yes i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house perfect shes using it she didnt take my name when we were married college nickname i just havent found it yet i tried c halbrook connie halbrook spunky halbrook she always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies sometimes its just her first initial sometime her nickname this pops is every phone book in america dad they dont know this cant this thing go any faster thats okay youre driving you still got the olds pops three years dad dont start you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose im thinking doesnt matter games over you as well its not me theyre overriding the system get us out of here must be thousands of them what are they doing what the hell are you doing i have a confession to make im not real big on flying well meet you there ill see how theyre doing with the radio transmitterdo not engage until weve confirmed the package has been delivered i think our secret is out theyre headed right for us roger eagle one our primary target has shifted course mr president just what do you think youre doing pilots sir we dont have enough people to get them in the air weve been collecting planes from all over but we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world most of europe the middle east and asia are battle ready better than we thought yes sir were down to approximately fifteen percent sir if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on were looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami ft worth and memphis eta with target four minutes the helicopter never arrived at nellis and theres been no radio contact she should be shortly but mr president sir what happens if they do become hostile with your permission mr president id like to remain my your side with their shields down it might be possible how long would their shields be down christ why didnt you say anything about this when they first arrived you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots you were the head of the national intelligence agency you knew all about this when were you planning on informing the rest of us my god the vice president and the joint chiefs were trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but were getting nowhere atlantic command is working on a type of visual communication more ships keep arriving fifteen in total so far sir i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately thats not your call to make mr nimziki its doing what how do you know a meteorthen what a countdown to what not really okay why did i just send my family to atlanta what happened havent you been watching can you believe this huh oh good good and well be the only guys in town with a clear picture thats my man thats the good news and the good news is you wont charge me whats the bad news weve tried its not working its almost as though they werent even there please would i be this panicked if it was that simple so sue me started this morning every channel is making like its nineteen fifty snow static all kinds of distortions no one knows what the hell is going on what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you dont turn it onthen get them out of there i could have evacuated the cities hours ago you know when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple we knew what we had to do its not simple anymore connie a lot of people died today how many didnt have to he used to run the nasa he knows where all the bones are buried comes in handy can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia roger wheres it headed grey you read me im a pilot will this is where i belong then find them but what general and our troops here howre we doing organize every plane you can find and get some goddamned pilots to fly them were being exterminated and our forces atlanta chicago and philadelphia destroyed where are they any news on my wife is my wife in the air and get those helicopters away from the ship call them back immediately general grey coordinate with atlantic command tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can then god help us i had a feeling you would i said call them back call them back deploy why the hell wasnt i told about this place above american soil were leaving so far these things have not become hostile for the moment lets assume they wont connie lets issue statements advising people not to panic to stay home and take cover i want the vice president secretary of defense the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location im staying here i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives im not leaving can they be killed what can you tell us about the enemy were facing people are dying out there i dont think exciting is the word id choose to describe it yes what do you want us to do can we negotiate a truce is there room for coexistance can there be peace between us and before here where do your people come from where is your home why did you people come herei dont hear no fat lady were loose nice meeting you whatre you doing i cant shake her free looks like theyre preparing the invasion just getting a feel for her great oh shit were late buttmunch yeah but what an entrance i should have done this a long long time ago before we do this i want you to know im sorry you know me you know how i like to make a big entrance buttmunch yes i am naw ill just tell my other girlfriends they cant come over tonight look after your shift tonight why dont you grab dylan and come stay with me on base what they cancelled it why are you acting like this baby you know how it is i have to report to el toro right away hes doing a good job jimmy stay with me so push it jimmy kick it theyre gaining command eagle one switching to sidewinders were moving in damn it i shouldnt have left her dont get premature on me jimmy we dont light up til the fat lady sings i thought you said you were doing to break it off how to kiss assi believe so the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology your console may not be configured to handle the data flow no there is a perimeter alert a ship has entered sensor range no no its so empty please give it back i need it yes but the enterprise my duty no no please you can not yes i am grateful for what you have given me but i still do not wish to be assimilated my creator did not intend for me to experience these things i wish to go back to the way i was i do not want this that is not true they have tried to help me no i will not betray my friends it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endoskeletal structure i do not know what you are referring to it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg today is march second 2063 the time in montana is oheightforty five according to our astrometric readings the year is 2063 the vortex is collapsing sir i have helm control it has entered earth orbit correction it is not in orbit it is heading directly toward the surface we are approaching the terran system captain the borg ship has modified its shields captain our phasers will no longer be effective dispersive armor is holding that is a contradiction the borg act as a collective consciousness there are no individuals who are you i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before as an android i am in complete control of my neural net the information contained there can not be forcibly removed no human beings do not have that luxury and neither should i i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming grief loss remorse not very well we met shortly after the enterprisee was commissioned i found her to be a most promising officer the planets surface is covered with borg technology so is the moon and three other planets in this solar systemtheyre getting awfully close what the hell are they doing well i feel a whole lot better with them out there we may need some help captain the enterprise theres no temporal shielding in here were starting to pick up relativistic effects the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating i dont think cochrane built this thing for comfort im on it the nacelles are charged nuclear warhead standing by were ready to ignite the warp drive the vulcans should be out there right now we need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if were going to get their attention ready to deploy the warp nacelles ignore it well be fine prepare for first stage shutdown and separation on my mark entering the upper ionospere solid rocket fuel at twentyfive thousand kilograms whats still there no the doors too thick captain weve got less than ten minutes before that vulcan ship leaves the system weve got to go now captain tell her to go back to resurrection always am they used copper pipes in their plumbing so i melted it down and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings its not the strongest alloy but its better than all this crude aluminum and steel maybe sure yeah as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration but so far we havent found any other photos were tearing this place apart looking for them but the computers are down and the fires destroyed half the filesso far nothing yeah if i knew what it looked like theres probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this this used to be the throttle valve assembly it controls the thrust of the engines its been completely vaporized and without it theres no way to launch the ship it could be the radiation captain try from the surface blast door its designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched alphanumeric lock we need a password to get in im picking up faint life signs twenty meters below im having trouble scanning underground theres a lot of radiation leaking from something this must be it i have the silo sir bearing three one zero distance three hundred meters captain im starting to worry about the hull integrity weve been running the support field at full power for three hours straight i dont know how much longer its going to hold upwere fine sir it will take some time to explain admiral whats the status of the borg fleet mister data set a pursuit course maximum warp absolutely beverly there were many reasons why you and i regardless of how i may feel about ruby our fates lie along different paths nothing can change that if theyre not wed better get used to living in montana not yet how did doctor almack react to that you actually performed surgery i have to go back to the silo will you be all right yes but until then youll have to make do with what youve got lets hope so because if cochrane dies the future may die with him im saying they might shoot us on sight you have to remember these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them it may not be that simple this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history as i recall the town of resurrection is about two kilometers east of here they might have a hospital its not the radiation and theres nothing wrong with the combadges the enterprise just isnt responding its cochrane im afraid so if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans earth will remain in the second dark age an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century yes were here to find zephram cochrane he may be injured or dead montana energize mister data i want to know the exact date and time give me a damage report on that missile silo what year is it contact starfleet command wheres the sphere what go to impulse wheres the borg ship ready quantum torpedo bring us about target borg ship alpha four port side battery oh just a little tinkering how is he where wheres the battery room for the hospital juice doctor crusher has been studying some advanced medical theories were crossing the threshold their com system must still be down picard to enterprise picard to enterprise do you read me one minute to warp threshold speed two hundred seventyfive thousand kilometers per second passing onehalf light speed the starboard nacelles running a little hot engage bring the warp core online ill lay in a heading as they used to say all systems are go theres a red light on the second intake valve altitude fifty kilometers get a tricorder youre going to have to track my exact position in that room then well just have to assume its still there itll have to wait come on this is picard ive suspended the launch sequence shes a very determined woman phoenix to control mister lange let her in we cant leave her out there when the ship launches shell be killed phoenix to control initiating five minute countdown mark ready to make a little history wheres you get the alloy for the throttle itself if there are other photographs i think i may know how to find them we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours there must be some design schematics blueprints can you reconstruct the throttle valve picard to enterprise enterprise please respond there should be some kind of manual release i have the password right here there should be an access hatch nearby probably from the nuclear warhead cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive how serious is the damage lets go understood keep me informed im afraid youve caught me i am a spaceman from another planet oh i almost forgot they have green blood and pointed ears there is no invasion invasion what do you want something wrong with that i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine and one of the fuel cells burst yes im an old friend of cochranes i wanted to see how he was doing it wasnt a trick i used to be an electrical engineer theres a few of us left california san francisco oh here and there you know how it is yes jeanluc picard oh yes ultraviolet protection thank you mister this may be hard for you to understand but im dutybound not to interfere with you or anyone else here any more than is absolutely necessary thats impossible no im from france no its a lot further than that i have to i am not a thief why are you being so difficult all im asking for is to look at one of the photographs itll take five minutes we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon a key piece of the ship has been destroyed and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like some myself and a few other friends of zephrams were trying to repair doctor cochranes ship its been damaged and id say you already have it cant wait until tomorrow ruby i need to talk to you about those photographs its very important how did you know about that were the two of you involved are you always sucha good judge of character what makes you say that what im an old friend i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in no but sometimes i feel that way what i meant was id be willing to trade for the photographs i can try did you take any other pictures of the rocket yes i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo there were three of them printed on some kind of fabric im very sorry cochrane ah yes but i didnt realize that yes he is track their weapons fire we have to follow them back repair whatever damage theyve done to that timeline life signs on screen signal the endeavor to fall back well cover them onscreen worf have doctor crusher mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three civilian clothes fire go to manual intercept course full impulse weapons status steady as she goes data set a course for that vortex time travel theyre attempting time travel full power mister data worf quantum torpedoes at my command fire unless youd like to stay then make it so have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex return to our own time ill keep in contact you have the bridge normally i would agree but in this case the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history youre many things number one but youre not much of an historian in twentyfour hours zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test from a missile silo in montana if im right the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship life signs on screen report they mustve done it in the past they went back and changed history worf torpedo nowno sir yes sir but captain are we all going back yes sir good luck sir and if they succeed humans wont make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow as first officer i should be the one beaming down captain cant tell longrange bio sensors are offline looks like they damaged the silo were still in earth orbit they did it they assimilated earth were caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex emergency override report worf im going to need at least five minutes ill keep that in mind right just a little queasy i guess id better get it right the first time agreed options theyre connecting the conduits to subspace communications computer thermal enhancement what are they doing we have to cover both possibilities well take care of the bridge worf take your men and seal off main engineering turn it into a fortress nothing gets in well have to assume theyve been assimilated into the collective what the hell is happening worf what assign another team if you need to i want to reestablish communication with the captain as soon as possible casualties are light captain minor buckling on the port nacelle nothing serious hold that thought i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll i remember it made me sick deflector dish why the deflector dish where the hell are they going all right weve lost control of eight decks three cargo bays one shuttlebay mister worf find data if you can but your top priority is isolating the borg the borg some of them mustve beamed over before we destroyed their ship seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields reportincoming transmission from starfleet command admiral hayes aye sir target locked phasers are offline we have two quantum torpedoes left but the computer targeting system has been destroyed captain ive found the borg sphere its on the far side of the planetfiring at the surface hull integrity down to thirty percent captain there are five borg ships closing in on our position aye sir port battery ready sir nothing weve lost bridge control understood and commander whatever you do do not vomit in your exosuit it would be unpleasant try not to look at the stars keep your eyes on the ship are you alright the borg will undoubtedly attack set phasers to rotating modulation you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation theres only one torpedo left destroy the deflector dish we have to stop them from sending that message theyre converting the deflector dish into an antennae theyre rerouting the deflector power conduits they appear to be modifying the deflector dish to control the enterprise theyll have to gain access to one of two locations main engineering or the bridge we saw at least thirtyand there are twentytwo enterprise crewmembers reported missing including commander data it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room a shipwide decompression has been initiated i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems so far theyve had no success incoming message from the starship intrepid admiral hayes commander we have a problem something is very wrong commander were falling back worf to bridge were about to enter the environmental control room theres a dampening field in place on this deck our tricorders are useless worf to bridge what kind of message datas positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise command codes security protocols there were no planetary defense systems in this era their weapons were designed to fight each other not extraterrestrials target no response im not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sectordo you realize that ive been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off shut up shuddup no stop come on enough ive got to use the phone okay ill think about that bye it didnt feel that way i dont know about that youre right i know i know i know shit thank you nikki well thank you

summer i swear you cant leave the house it hurts it physically hurts ive been around here six months and i still cant get over it i know its like the opposite of inbreeding the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool a dewars on the rocks and a bud please ill get a dewars rocks kinda money huh thats probably a more appropriate analogy its kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing its kinda cool its like youre in on some kind of secret you tell a chick youve been some place its like bragging that you know how to find it the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there you have to have someone come before there is a direct line connecting you back to the original unequivocally cool club patrons its kinda like judaism its one of these for some reason cool bars in la have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven looks like were in a dead heat after one hole this is turning into quite a rivalry whatd you get i dont know eight or nine what do you have a pluto call back you want to hit the town tonight ive decided to get out there go ahead play it out the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that im not going to talk about her anymore i thought youd appreciate that i didnt mention her once today i dont talk about her that much what like you didnt want to jinx it why havent you noticed i didnt mention michelle once today you tested over a month ago im sure they figured it out by now what do you want youre tall look theres not much of a call for shakespeare in this town youre an actor find the zen in the role its a gig rob i just want you to know youre the only one i can talk to about her its just that youve been there your advice really helps thanks man sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time theres the rub unless she comes back first right wait what do you mean so its almost a retroactive decision so i could like lets say forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her well that sucks so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her so whats the difference so i dont call either way but you said i shouldnt call if i wanted to give up on her and what if i dont want to give up on her shes really special guys believe me i know what thats like yo double down what time are we leaving dont sweat it man i needed a kick in the ass were better friends for it what are they doing here it was six months and she didnt dump you live in such a fantasy world yeah here its easier to avoid trouble its not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day nobodys mugging you on no subway in new york the trouble finds you out here you got ta go look for it you asshole why are you carrying a gun what in case someone steps to you snoop dogg you asshole she didnt like me i made a fool of myself i cant believe

so fuckin money it was like that jedi mind shit and then im struggling to impress some chick whos not half as classy as my girlfriend who im not even really attracted to its just tough after sleeping with someone you love for so long to be with someone new who doesnt know what i like and you got ta wear a jimmy its just that ive been out of the game so long trent i was with her for six years thats before aids im scared i dont know how to talk to them i dont know thats bullshit i dont know she likes you im too tired for this lets just go you think so i dont think so what are you nuts you think shes coming back lets go im not paying for a room and if we dont leave now well never make it she was smiling at what an asshole you are i cant believe what an asshole you are that was so demeaning what an asshole what an asshole lets go lets just leave you won theres nothing to be sorry about youre a winner im the fuckin loser i should be sorry dont give me that shit you know exactly how much you lost whatd you drop yea how much thanks for clarifying that but i lost how can you say always im just saying not in this particular case yeah well obviously not always but thats two hundred dollars this is blood money i know but what oh theyre watching all right theyre watching thats where we make our scene the trick is to look like you dont need it then they give you shit for free dont

dont feel like going out tonight i got shit to do tomorrow i dont know sup trenti mean does it have to be goofy i was playing hamlet offbroadway two months ago for crying out loud four days im considering taking a job as a goofy no i havent heard an official no yet my pleasure by the way the guys back home said she put on some weight sure for the same reason you miss her you lived with it so long sometimes is still hurts you know how it is man i mean each day you think about it less and less and then one day you wake up and you dont think of it at all and you almost miss that feeling its kinda weird you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long and the boom something reminds you of her and you just smile that bittersweet smile because you left man shes got her own world to deal with in new york she was a sweet girl but fuck her you got ta move on you got ta let go of the past the future is so beautiful every day is so sunny out here its like manifest destiny man i mean we made it whats past is prologue that which does not kill us makes us stronger all that shit youll get over it thats your problem man you cant see what youve got only what youve lost those guys are right you are money see its all how you look at it if your life sucks then mine is god awful i mean i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing you got in the union you got an agent i thought if you could make it maybe i could too they went for someone with more theme park experience i woulda killed for that job at least you didnt get turned down for goofy well youre doing so well well thats dumb she wasnt your type anyway oh boy its been two days you should call that girl nikki you want to talk about it dont sweat it now i got an la gun story you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home he had an uzi mike halfsmiles you havent been drinking have you no problem buddy you eat anything today ill be your winger go for it man youre a better man than i am charlie brown its unbelievable him oh like that song whats that guys name sue whats the big deal everyone steals from everyone i just tested for one theres the rub i cant wait till i actually get to touch one of them its like every day i see a beautiful woman im not used to that im used to seeing a beautiful woman i dont know once a week i cant handle it darwinism at its best i cant get over how cute the girls in this city are bud classy sounds more like aids that doesnt sound too good for business oh where is this place so if the party starts at eight why are we first going to a bar at ten an eight ill give you an eight how many strokes sure kick me when im down i shouldnt mike its a weeknight i do good for you man well until now tend the pin oh no kinda i dont know its like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter i didnt want to say anything its like hi mom im not going to be starring in that sitcom and oh by the way im goofy send more money do you realize how hard its going to be to tell my parents i still havent told them i didnt get the pilot theres just something about being goofy any other disney character would be fine theres just this stigma associated with the character its definitely a step back for me i mean i need the money i dont think im gon na take it thanks thanks man no problem hey man dont sweat it theres the rub ah see thats the thing somehow they dont come back until you really dont care anymore i mean first youll pretend not to care not call whatever and then eventually you really wont care right or more likely the opposite it sucks right the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back see you cant do anything to make her want to come back you can only do things to make her not want to come back right right you dont callgood for you man hes being smart thanks man ive been hating myself for the last two days but most important man im sorry about what i said i was drunk my adrenaline was going we ran into them that night at roscoes tee cleared it up i apologized bought them some chicken and waffles they fuckin love tee that boy can talk im so sorry man you were

got back to the cave but you were among the british they were your friends why betray them there was a result to what you did it wasnt just another expedition it did this if the british hadnt unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died what did you say you were the only man who knew the desert well enough the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing before you went over to the germans before you got rommels spy across the desert and inside british headquarters he took some pretty good photographs i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk so they made an impression id seen you writing in that book at the embassy in cairo when i had thumbs and you had a face and a name so i come across the hospital convoy i was looking for this stuff and some nurse mary hanas friend tells me about you and hana hiding in a monastery in purdah whatever it is retreat how youd come in from the desert and you were burned and you didnt know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession a copy of herodotus and it was full of letters and cuttings and then i knew it must be you there are going to be

find the peace youve sought in vain for so long shes coming back keep talking concentrate she can hear you go ahead i believe right now she may hear you now you must listen to me this force is like a

waits a beat then takes it im going to need some blood it must be from a woman your daughters been taken i took pity on the poor woman this house is too big for one person to live alone in in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here she would call me and i would come by she attended the church for years a dear woman it was sad to see her decline so rapidly thank you i believe she would have wanted it may i come in at her request she was a very religious woman you must be a londrigan well you know where to reach me the church is a stones throw away if you want to come to mass take care of the girl take care of your family they are important i wish i had an answer evil is powerful more so every day it seems but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us i didnt do anythinggod saved her yes it is will and seamus look at each other keep talking it will not take long i said nothing before for fear you wouldnt believe me ive exorcised forces from this house eliza knew she was there it wants another soul the one weve taken away we must weaken it we must return it if you want your daughter back i said nothing before for fear you wouldnt believe me ive been here before to cast evil from this house the amulet is a guard against evil blessed in countless rituals it is an ancient ceremony of the early catholic church a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost did you remove anything in the cellar the amulet hopefully the whole sad chapter is over and everyone including your family will find peace will i just want tothank all of you

actual list is safe at langley golitsyn was a lightning rod one of ours thats right max it seems has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents this time hes gotten to someone on the inside hes put himself in a position to buy our noc list an operation he referred to as job 314 the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight for a little over two years now weve been spotting serious blowback in imf operations we have a penetration the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as max youre right maybe thisll save some time i

it but you i took him out to sea and threw him in the water even if they find him what connects him with me mitchell was dead enough mine it wasnt the time or place dont worry about the note baby im playing for my neck now im still on course to victoria nobody saw you get on board nobody seen you since dont go soft on me baby ive got your note in my pocket you wrote it all by your own self and i have to use it it has to be found in exactly the right place magruder obliged me no use my saying it wasnt planned that way i had to clean up im not a dumb smart college boy anymore nobody in the world would believe i didnt plan the whole thing not this one and not mitchell no i paid him off it buys things just like any other kind nobody believed i wasnt in on it i was just a dumbsmart collage boy and he was my father i thought it was a legitimate business he was a politician with fingers in a lot of pies i never saw the pies they had names for the record innocent names you know where that kind of money comes from dont you so could you but our records were a little against us in a way i told you my father died in jail he stole a fortune most of it pretty dirty money i dont care to have that known including killaine thats right that and the fun of it wonder what go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink careful how you go were hitting the swell now cold there would be a moon tonight see anything killaines wise we cant wait any longer here put this on but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor ill tell you when well my father died in jail and he was twice the man i am id still go througheven if i ended up in jail its the frame on the picture but not if you say so it did but it never paid off until now i ought to be back within an hour we cant leave until near dark anyway youll be safe here i wont be long help yourself to anything you want the galleys through there you can make coffee if you like the best interference runner weve got he thinks hes in love with youand hes a gentleman come here baby if they had any reason to why make it tough for themselves why go to all that trouble heres an open book close it no reason to keep it open she was a nice girl anyway and perhaps she didnt kill him on purpose perhaps she didnt kill the other one you never know give her the benefit of the doubt leave her stay where she is close the book finis blonde beautiful and sadand nowhere of course she might have run awayif she knew how and where to go she might have dyed her hair bleached it before probably and changed her name again but look at this note and look at her room in the hotel her stuff is all there hasnt a rag except what she stood up in you dont run away like that not if you are young and beautiful no chance i run over to victoria play some golf with some people i know do it all the time thats why i have a cabin cruiser custom builtforty knots mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure member of six golf clubs broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course you have to be good to do that and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria in a few hours you can look right down on mr brandons boat the valkyrie came alone sure he always comes alone mr brandons a rather lonely man this is the ace betty but not of spades theyll find out about the other they might know already and when they get this what would they look for where out there somewhere how bad is the other thing the secret how bad is it bad enough for theres a lot of water between vancouver and the usa this note is a suicide note after youre gone where would they look for you why would they look for you darkness and open water and a fast cabin cruiser and i have a pocket full of money and if i helped you id be committing a crime or so they tell me if you meant it you wouldnt show it to me betty or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine i know killaine has a warrant no percentage in that youre probably mistaken about that lets get together sand talk it over theres always a solution to these problems but it must be near the water quite near yes if you dont mind waiting cant be too close for me right across the street from it suits me anything else listed i dont think thats on the market anymore id like something much closer to the water it sounds like a fair location could you be a little more exact from you i like it thats the second round ive lost tonight that fellow hurt me no use waiting then it still doesnt matter if i kiss you try not talking anything i can do about it why us hes not a cop a cop wouldnt have kneed me hes a fellow with a very hard knee and he knows how to use it well find out quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby couldnt be killaines not that sort of guy he said nohe meant no i didnt notice him i know everybody i dont look at half of life just the nice half i look at all of it why not want to dance at this time of night its not as bad as it looks cold im different i like it fine just who are you anyway lets not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us so there is you dont want to go to bed i dont want to go to bed lets go somewhere and hear some musichave something to drink something to eateven dance quarter after one why he could hardly help suspecting you bad you didnt have to tell him that want a spike in it its always a mistake to run away always you tried to run away id rather wait until it does matter he was a great boy for that what else nice of him how did you meet him theyll know whether he killed himself sure but somebody always does he got in here how whats funny about that if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you the world is full of larry mitchells dont take it so big it isnt a tragedy i know its a littler late for an apology dance he doesnt even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor thanks for the fresh air that felt good neatly saidbut to the wrong man the trouble with pretty girls is that they cant imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls i get tired of it i dont know you and you dont know me i made a reasonably polite suggestion but im sure youd rather be alone whatever you say i can be talked out of it as a matter of fact id like a dry martini myself no are you really going to drink that stuff i never pay for anything they just keep me here to amuse the guests sure but id hate like the dickens to be held to everything ive said before wouldnt you no not very well and i like his friends even less but if you really want a good dry martini brandon clark brandon fellow about my age lot of money that he didnt make former american now naturalized in canada social standing indeterminate manners not quite perfect scotch superb its openhouse no crashing involved anybody in the hotels welcome it might be worth a martini to you a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here hes holding open house i was up there too noisy bored disgusting arent they if you really want a martini i know where you can get one sit down then we often have a double up here you can have the table yourself if youd rather

along how about a cup of coffee near his right hand about a foot away perhaps more good heavens one doesnt use a tape measure no could be on miss mayfields balcony beside the chaise i picked it up dont ask me why i ought to know better yes ive seen it before thats what i thought at first maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party with my liquor of course somebody mitchell picked up on the train i dont even know her name would it have helped if id knocked him down round of golf saturday hows life treating you youre not english what dont bet on it im eccentric want to walk out or get thrown out i wouldnt know just do it somewhere else there is such a thing as good manners do me a favor mitchell find yourself a nice secluded park bench lay off cant you hello mitchell having fungreer and goble in the call building san francisco just like you thoughttwo murders in two days different places different methods different people nothing connects them but a telephone number you win inspector you win all along the line why didnt we think of brandon beforeor did we some of us yeah of course you did when a suspect thinks hes safe you go on letting him think hes safe wait for a mistake no suicide and she did give him the chance the way it worked out how did he know hed get the chance he couldnt have arranged it ive got to find a way to handle it openly like brandon ive handled it mitchells handed it if i wipe it off no suicide if i take it out and lose it no suicide if i leave it hereno suicide this is the shell what about the gun pretty big chance huh do i know that shes out of the room likely to be out of it for some time do i know who lives down there such as before i took the story and closed the case id want to know a lot more about these people id want to know just about everything about them if ive got any sense im going to call headquarters should be over there i think so maybe weve been pretty dumb thats pretty risky business inspector gigi huh sounds frenchone of those fancy ladies must have been very fancy if he scratched her phone number in gold i guess im just ballast around here she didnt seem the type to lam outeven if she got the chance that stuff was all gone through last night anything special youre looking for inspector right a clean deduction from observed facts theyve got to be simple once in a while inspector unless the gun was slanted up this make of gun throws a shell backwards high and to the right the chaise is only about four feet from the wall correct inspector a womans gun us 125 caliber ammunition in it it was on a table in there its her room she only got to the hotel this afternoon with him i guess he took too much for granted heres the gun i supposed you knew her too inspector they tell me hell be a great loss to the liquor trade this mayfield girl right you in charge herewhats the matter baby dont you like being kissed just drunk enough maybe youre going to have to like me how careful should i be why certainly baby betty this is margo west she wants to meet you miss mayfield if you change your mind about the cocktail party or anything else give me a buzz okay you win dont i even get my face slapped the brushoff huh nobody id rather have on a leash nobody gets invited to clark brandons parties they just go well how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six oclock a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there we have some nice places around vancouver whats the matter dine and dance tonight ive got fifty bucks to throw away dont get me wrong betty im not suggesting you murdered anybody you know how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm hes a useful guy to have on your side i have a darned good idea youre name isnt betty mayfield at all i think youre a nice girl i like you but i can read signs if the print is large enough it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector a sort of tenseness as if you were afraid of something suppose i hadnt known that immigration inspector hadnt put in a good word for you no thanks nice room balcony and everything lovely view too you dont know indefinitely a very small service it doesnt even ask for thanks how long for ill make one for you i live there where are you staying in vancouver royal its pretty crowded you know or reno they always throw them off the bridge there ive heard vancouver bc you could tell me your name and where youre going same as an hour ago remember im the steady type my names larry mitchell i live in vancouver you dont throw guests out brandon how would you know brandon did i do something wrong lay off what this is my new girl friend met her on the train shes very fond of me love at first sight wasnt it baby whats the matter baby dont you like me anymore the liquors lovely the rest of the party you can have nothing to discuss tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter be grateful for small mercies im afraid this is all for the moment a little something on account perhaps good afternoon mr campbell unsophisticated if i knew about this babe i say yes in that case theres someone here id like to introduce to you over there be nasty im sorry i forgot about calling for you right i told you shes just of course i didnt mean it that way im sorry its against the law to cross the border with a gun the canadian police might like to know about this how long have you had it whats this thats not very kind its the only pose i have left im sunk broke i dont even have my hotel bill ive always been a heel i guess i always will be whatll we do about it margo correct i couldnt even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me i have a rough idea i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared i wasnt lucky i dont my hunch is shes just torn up an unhappy marriage i was able to do her a small favor rich i havent the faintest idea why margo darling you washed me up remember were just friends you wanted it that way you shouldnt you washed me up very thoroughly shes just a girl i met on the train you dont mind do you her names mayfield betty mayfield soso im afraid youre not very glad to see me margofind her you dipshit where the fuck did she go she cant get both of us i thought she was dead its on the table get the gun ill untie pops and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head its a perfect ending what if your father snapped your moms anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree killing everyone ready you know what time it is sid its after midnight its your mothers anniversary we killed her exactly one year ago today think about it on the off chance i get caught a motive like that could divide a jury for years dont you think you took my mother so i took yours big sympathy factor maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior it certainly fucked you up it made you have sex with a psychopath and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people dont think so you see its scarier when theres no motive sid tell that to cotton weary you wouldnt believe how easy it was to frame him its an easy game we ask you a question if you get it wrong you die where ya going its not over yet weve got one more surprise stu i believe its your turn i was hoping sid and i could talk you ready to party hard tonight because im trying to build your selfesteem youre far too sensitive duh thats quick thanks butt wart you did good howd you do you open your mouth and stupidity pours out no ones saying you did its called tact you fuckrag no i didnt i didnt kill anyone sheriff yes sir i

sidney if you hang up youll die just like your mother uhhuh right here thats the original part your front porch the question is not who am i the question is where am i maybe thats because im not randy are you alone in the house and why is that whats your favorite scary movie do you like scary movies sidney scary night isnt it with the murders and all its like right out of a horror movie or somethingsleep tight sweetie so call if you need me no oh well im hitting the sack my flight leaves first thing in the morning now the expo runs all weekend so i wont be back til sunday theres cash on the table and ill be staying at the raleigh hilton i heard screaming are you okaytwice working thank you oooooh before or after he sliced and diced you got it listen to me sid i found tatum shes dead shes been killed i think stu did it dont shoot its me shes the scream queen no sid dont listen to him its him hes the one yeah there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie for instance 1 you can never have sex the minute you get a little nookie youre as good as gone sex always equals death 2 never drink or do drugs the sin factor its an extension of number one and 3 never ever ever under any circumstances say ill be right back not until trading places in 83 jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies she didnt show her tits until she went legit there goes my chance with sid whats leatherface doing here we could be like two grief stricken students and well say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly i had em hid in the foreign section its 1995 motives are incidental youre absolutely right im the first to admit it if this were a scary movie id be the prime suspect so while theyre off investigating a dead end billy whos been written off as a suspect is busy planning his next hunting expedition because hes probably dead his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere eyes gauged see the police are always off track with this shit if theyd watch prom night theyd save time theres formula to it a very simple one everyones always a suspect the father the principal the town derelict could be now that billys tried to mutilate her you think sid would go out with me maybe sidney wouldnt have sex with him theres always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend thats the beauty of it all simplicity besides if its too complicated you lose your target audience because obviously they dont watch enough movies this is standard horror movie stuff prom night revisited youre such a little lap dog hes got killer printed all over his forehead if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section yeah im off early curfew you know now thats poor taste we had a run in the mass murder section did you really put her liver in the mailbox i hear they found her liver in the mailbox besides takes a man to do something like that it would certainly improve your high school q and are the police aware you dated the victim before she dumped him for steve that was an ice pick not exactly the samewere gon na have to keep you billy the governors got sbi fbi and god knows who else on their way down here did you ride past casey beckers house and last night sidney said you crawled through her window last night too you rode your bike out there thank you hank were on it what were you doing out at sidneys tonight watch her dont let on just keep your eyes out hold off for now just stay close to her hed have to be crazy wheres sidney they believe hes out of state by now well keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night if hes not picked up by morning well do a house to house theres more guess what tomorrow is the anniversary of his wifes death it all fits hes our man listen up dewey because its bad real bad aircomp just faxed us the calls were listed to neil prescott sidneys father he made the calls with his cellular phone its confirmed dewey where the hell you been boy shes okay looks like some boys were teasing her himbrys shutting down the school though i want you to take look around she staying with you twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance but these kids today damn if i know what about the cellular phone bill have to be the shit shes gone through how is she what were you doing out here hank loomis kid aw jesus how is everythingi cant im bad off billy you cut too deep i dont know billy but im hurtin odds are shell miss anyway she looked dead still does no its not thats it billy i cant take any more im feeling woozy everyone dies but us we get to carry on and plan the sequel lets face it these days you got ta have a sequel except for me and billy we were left for dead yeah this is the best part sid billys got it all figured out why do you think we kept your father alive so long why did we save you for last thats right and now that youre no longer a virgin you got ta die those are the rules nope yeah we just watched a few movies took a few notes it was fun and if you get it right you die you have to play sid dont want to disappoint your dad hes been waiting around all night oh yeah dude what are you doing here you know it oh i was just asking why are you always at me so you gon na try and make up with sid piece of cake shell be there sorry owwww i didnt kill anybody sorry what she asked come on sid give me the gun his movie nut mind has snapped sid hes gone psycho ill be right back wan na another beer i wan na see jamie lees breasts when do we see jamie lees breasts like you had one he came to make up i can cry on cue i thought everything was checked out and what would be your motive which is you i think her father did it how come they cant find his ass shes saving herself for you so whats his reason why would he want to kill his own girlfriend the whyd the police let him go it was all a misunderstanding he didnt do anything what you coming tonight jesus this place is packed im gon na gut your ass in a second what are you saying that i killed her or something for about two seconds yeah casey and steve were completely hollowed out takes a man to do something like that peer pressure im way to sensitive the official term is psychotic its all part of the game guess i wont be needing this anymore you guys can go up to my parents room to talk and whatever cool see you guys tonight bring food remember theres safety in numbers my parents are out of town itll be like my hurricane bash last year nothing extreme just a few of us hangin and

you you will for sure is that right i feel sad about karen cross too i just make like to myself she loves me i know better though it just feels good to me when i imagine it seems like doyles wormed his way back in mama said hes stayin over tonight and hes talkin about movin in for good we aint ever gon na be happy well always be nervous wont we karl what you readin she said shed see me later thats kinda good right bible says the same thing about killin others too i didnt mean to say anything bad about you i know youre good you didnt mean no harm did you ever think about killin yourself on purpose like my daddy did that makes me feel real sad couldnt you have done somethin karl i would have i wish i would of had him hed be here right now livin that dont seem right it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother it was still alive when you buried it you threw it in a trash barrel a boy or girl it was alive so it died when it come out why why not it died cause its fun it dont matter if you aint no good it takes your mind off of everything else while youre doin it when you run real fast tryin to make a touchdown you dont think about anything else i aint no good but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it did you have any brothers and sisters growin up to play with and then some people you dont like right off its funny you know why i want you to play ball with me you dont seem like a daddy you seem like a brother wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you dont even know em like what happened with me and you i kind of like you tellin me what to do and not to do just like my daddy i didnt mind him tellin me i hate doyle to tell me what to do mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us that we cant leave him or hell try and hurt her i didnt know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama i tried it but i felt funny thinkin about my mama so i switched over to thinkin about his mama and then what he told me would happen happened it sure tingles dont it oh jackin off what do you mean and i dont try to touch her you know in a bad way foolin around sex and all just cause im not rich dont mean i dont love her i usually get run off

here and somebody was mean to mama vaughan hes real good to mama vaughan that you met but hes not able to do anything to doyle hes funny you know not funny ha ha funny queer he likes to go with men instead of women that makes him not to be able to fight too good he sure is nice though hes from st louis people who are queer can get along better in a big town he got transferred here to work but

thought tell me something what are you thinking right now anyway its hard to live gay thats the right way to say it in a small town like this ive wanted to leave many times but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wont go into have kept me from it anyway im rambling if youre going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wont be easy doyle is a monster not

tune maybe even psychic doyle will make your life hell youre a perfect target when i first saw you i was afraid of you not really afraid i guess just taken aback but also i felt a real sensitive feeling from you and for some reason frank has adopted you much like a stray animal im sorry i didnt mean it like that in a good way anyway i just want you to know what youre in for i have a good feeling about you youre good for frank maybe its that he can have an adult friend on a childs level im sorry i didnt mean it in a bad way theres one more thing its none of my business why you were in

youre capable of being around linda and frank you know you would never hurt them under any circumstances would you well thats a very offensive way to put it you shouldnt say that you were taught that

david niven malcolm mclaren elvis presley no its not bad but its not great either is it and in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right its actually just shite well at one time youve got it and then you lose it and its gone for ever all walks of life george best for example had it and lost it or david bowie or lou reed its certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life roald dahl tomorrow afternoon usual setup and i wondered if youd care to go to the park tomorrow but youre looking better it has to be said healthier radiant even you can look it up fuck off he never wrote any of them screenwriter director running time you only live twice i would say in those days he was a muscular actor in every sense with all the presence of someone like cooper or lancaster but combined with a sly wit to make him a formidable romantic lead closer in that respect to cary grant goldfingers better than dr no both of them are a lot better than diamonds are forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office in which field of course thunderball was a notable success look tommy we know youre getting a hard time off lizzy but theres no need to take it out on us its really nice tommy can we go home now are you serious such as sitting in a darkened room watching videos drinking smoking dope and wanking does that answer your question if im giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket im just saying it had better be good theres plenty of other things i could be doing this had better be goodyouve stabbed me man no i dont mean like that i mean something nice like thats all i dont know maybe ill buy something for my ma and then buy some good speed no bicarb like then get a girl take her out like and treat her properly i want the money mark

here that is i hope im not talking too much i dont usually i think its all important though isnt it only to get my foot in the door showing initiative right no actually i went to craignewton but i was worried that you wouldnt have heard of it so i put the royal edinburgh college instead because theyre both schools right and were all in this together and i wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details yeah people get all hung up on details but whats the point like which school does it matter why when where or how many o grades did i get could be six could be one but thats not important whats important is that i am right that i am id really rather take care of it myself its no problem no ill wash them ill take them home and bring them back sorry about last night would not say no would not say no a little too well if anything a little too well thats my only fear compadre my problem is that i tend to clam up i go dumb and i cant answer any questions at all nerves on

fair enough ive got balls like watermelons im telling you she read it in cosmopolitan its a nightmare she told me she didnt want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would
