well look at them do you like this salieri yes really of course not oh why not i dont think you understand me court composer well there it is you please me court composer a very clever idea ahha favouritism but i so want mozart and the result satisfies yes im thinking about herr mozart what is your view good morning court composer this is my niece the princess elizabeth cattivo again court composer well tell him mozart name us a german virtue well im glad to hear that well there it is now to business young man we are going to commission an opera from you what do you say and here is our illustrious court composer herr salieri ahha lets have some fun bring in herr mozart please but slowly slowly i need a minute to practice delightful court composer would you permit me to play it as he comes in may i try it what a charming idea may i see you are cattivo court composer i want to meet this young man chamberlain arrange a pleasant welcome for him you are passionate mozart but you do not persuade well six or seven minutes maybe eight i have no idea ah love again i think you are rather innocent my friend in these dangerous times i can not afford to provoke our nobles or our people simply over a theatre piece mozart i am a tolerant man i do not censor things lightly when i do i have good reason figaro is a bad play it stirs up hatred between the classes in france it has caused nothing but bitterness my own dear sister antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people i do not wish to see the same fears starting here would you tell me why it is not your place to ask questions is it true yet we hear you are making an opera from it is this true mozart are you aware i have declared the french play of figaro unsuitable for our theatre ah by all means what is it bravo mozart most charming yes indeed clever man well my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna excuse me but how old are you really how delightful may i ask when you marry enchanted madame my dear young man dont take it too hard your work is ingenious its quality work and there are simply too many notes thats all cut a few and it will be perfect my dear fellow there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening i think im right in saying that arent i court composer well i mean occasionally it seems to have how shall one say how shall one say director of course i do its very good of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate oh yes absolutely german unquestionably yes indeed what on one hearing only ahha yes where well what is it about tell us the story why so did we vote in the end for german or italian and now he has returned the compliment herr salieri composed that march of welcome for you the director of our opera count orsinirosenberg no no please it is not a holy relic you know we have met already in this very room perhaps you wont remember it you were only six years old he was giving the most brilliant little concert here as he got off the stool he slipped and fell my sister antoinette helped him up herself and do you know what he did jumped straight into her arms and said will you marry me yes or no ahha well there it is good yes what about him well what do you have for me today well there it is ahha what do you say chamberlain very small pay i imagine im sure he could be tempted with the right offer say an opera in german for our national theatre ahha well then we should make some effort to acquire him we could use a good german composer in vienna surelyoh your grace i thank your grace i thank you oh sir hes never disobeyed me in anything please your grace give him one more chance yes sir thats the truth but dont blame him the fault is mine i was too indulgent with him but not again never again i promise i implore you let me bring him back here ill make him give his word to serve you faithfully sir oh sir yes hes about to make the worst

minutes of continuous music no recitatives guess guess majesty imagine the longest time such a thing could last then double it but its new its entirely new its so new people will go mad for it for example i have a scene in the second act it starts as a duet just a man and wife quarreling suddenly the wifes scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly a very funny situation duet turns into trio then the husbands equally screaming valet comes in trio turns into quartet then a stupid old gardener quartet becomes quintet and so on on and on sextet septet octet how long do you think i can sustain that but majesty this is just a frolic its a piece about love sire i swear to your majesty theres nothing like that in the story i have taken out everything that could give offense i hate politics well majesty it is only a comedy well yes i admit it is who told you this majesty yes sire may i introduce my father he is on a short visit here and returning very soon to salzburg he would

seat the only problem is none will hire me they all want to hear me play but they wont let me teach their daughters as if i was some kind of fiend im not a fiend how can anyone say that we have no cook no maid we have no footman nothing at all no but im broke im always broke i dont know why look i must have pupils without pupils i cant manage but i cant lose this post i simply cant excellency please lets go to the palace and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice he could actually do musical harm to the princess sommer herr sommer but the mans a fool hes a total mediocrity whom did they choose filled thats impossible they havent even seen my work i need this post please cant you help me please why here is the music its here i am submitting it humbly isnt that what you wanted so you see this post is very important to me right now she is well she is well actually im about to become a father she only told me last night you are the first to know your excellency you requested some specimens of my work here they are i dont have to tell you how much i need your help i truly appreciate your looking at these i have pressures on me financial pressures as you know im a married man now it really is the best music one can hear in vienna today dont you agree did you like it then but this is absurd love sire a funny little tune but it yielded some good things mio caro adone i know your work well signore do you know i actually composed some variations on a melody of yours oh yes certainly certainly herr director what are you doing herr director but surely the emperor didnt mean to prohibit dancing when its part of the story yes but this is not a ballet this is a dance at figaros wedding certainly herr director just let me tell you how it begins but your majesty well not especially it can be in turkish if you really want i dont care exactly i i dont think you have herr director not yet i mean its quite n of course ill show it to you immediately may i just do that majesty show you how it begins just that must i well i wont i tell you straight i will not show them one interesting modulation and they faint ohime morbidezza morbidezza italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music they hate my music it terrifies them the only sound italians understand is banality tonic and dominant tonic and dominant from here to resurrection baba baba baba baba anything else is morbid naturally the italians of course always the italians who is on this committee no but im the best then why doesnt he simply appoint me to the post is the emperor angry with me why do i have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee just to teach a sixteenyearold girl what is this herr chamberlain elevated what does that mean elevated the only thing a man should elevate is oh excuse me im sorry im stupid but i am fed up to the teeth with elevated things old dead legends how can we go on forever writing about gods and legends sire only opera can do this in a play if more than one person speaks at the same time its just noise no one can understand a word but with music with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once and its not noise its a perfect harmony isnt that marvelous baron why not its charming i mean i dont actually show concubines exposing their their its not indecent its highly moral majesty its full of proper german virtues i swear it absolutely oh german german please let it be germandont pity me pity yourself you serve a wicked god he killed mozart not i took him snatched him away without pity he destroyed his beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory he doesnt care understand that god cares nothing for the man he denies and nothing either for the man he uses he broke mozart in half when hed finished with him and threw him away like an old worn out flute no father from now on no one will be able to speak of mozart without thinking of me whenever they say mozart with love theyll have to say salieri with loathing and thats my immortality at last our names will be tied together for eternity his in fame and mine in infamy at least its better than the total oblivion hed planned for me your merciful god what difference does that make i poisoned his life i did the only thing that worried me was the actual killing how does one do that how does one kill a man its one thing to dream about it its very different when you have to do it with your own hands his funeral imagine it the cathedral all vienna sitting there his coffin mozarts little coffin in the middle and suddenly in that silence music a divine music bursts out over them all a great mass of death requiem mass for wolfgang mozart composed by his devoted friend antonio salieri what sublimity what depth what passion in the music salieri has been touched by god at last and god forced to listen powerless powerless to stop it i at the end for once laughing at him do you understand do you oh yes yes yes yes yes always the same stale answers there is no god of mercy father just a god of torture oh i thought you did so every day so speak now answer me all i ever wanted was to sing to him thats his doing isnt it he gave me that longing then made me mute why tell me that if he didnt want me to serve him with music why implant the desire like a lust in my body then deny me the talent go on tell me speak for him no was mozart a good man yes father yes so much for my vow of chastity what did it matter good patient hardworking chaste what did it matter had goodness made me a good composer i realized it absolutely then that moment goodness is nothing in the furnace of art and i was nothing to god every day sometimes for hours i would pray it was incomprehensible what was god up to here i was denying all my natural lust in order to deserve gods gift and there was mozart indulging his in all directions even though engaged to be married and no rebuke at all was it possible i was being tested was god expecting me to offer forgiveness in the face of every offense no matter how painful that was very possible all the same why him why use mozart to teach me lessons in humility my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts i couldnt stop them he was murdered father mozart cruelly murdered do you believe it and do they believe it ah youve heard that i didnt that was mozart wolfgang amadeus mozart you know who that is can you recall no melody of mine i was the most famous composer in europe when you were still a boy i wrote forty operas alone what about this little thing well im surprised you dont know it was a very popular tune in its day i wrote it how about this then you must know this where how well are you trained in music i do not seek forgiveness are they do you know who i am you never heard of me did you leave me alone what do you want so about what what do you wantextremely clever you were sublime well what does it matter to you what looks and talent dont always go together katherina you might be disappointed perhaps my dear it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout vienna as a singing prostitute for a turk a turkish brothel a brothel in a harem well do you know where its set my dear well even if there is i dont think you want to get involved with this one no yes oh news travels fast in vienna really what else did he tell you today give me some gossip good morning madame i will respect his he asked me to stay here no i was assisting him he asked me he asked me to stay he needs me maam i was at hand your husband is ill maam he took sick i brought him home what then dont its up to you not to be vague that is the price its a post all vienna seeks if you want it for your husband come tonight isnt it obvious some service deserves service in return no alone come back tonight tomorrow night i dine with the emperor one word from me and the post is his it is miraculous these are originals originals are you sure you cant leave that music and come back again i have other things you might like dont keep calling me that it puts me at such a distance i was not born a court composer you know im from a small town just like your husband i see then he didnt send you really im afraid im not at leisure this very moment just leave them with me i assure you they will be quite safe i will look at them of course the moment i can it will be an honour please give him my warmest i understand how charming but why did he not come himself frau mozart madame how can i help you it is not a question of liking your majesty your own law decrees it im afraid molested majesty twice in the course of the same lesson as a matter of fact one of my own pupils a very young singer told me she was er well i have to tell you mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies majesty i dont like to talk against a fellow musician well sire i made some inquiries in a routine way i was curious to know why he had so few pupils it is rather alarming majesty i did believe me it was a most agonizing decision but finally i simply could not recommend herr mozart sire im sure there is a way majesty some kind of a little contest i could perhaps put together a small committee and i could see to it naturally that it will select according to your majestys wishes yes of course my concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism you already commissioned an opera from mozart an interesting idea majesty but oh your majesty it would be such a tremendous honour your highness excuse me sire but what do you think these could be being a foreigner i would love to learn my pleasure finally such an immense joy diletto straordinario aflat majesty you do me too much honour sire majesty its just a trifle of course i think it is an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna majesty it should really infuriate the archbishop beyond measure if that is your majestys intention are you sure its an opera opera opera is he working is he working where what medicine why what has happened now calm yourself calm whats the matter with you where does he work yes what of course not youre a good girl youre very kind to do this next time youre sure theyll be out of the house let me know will you really what is it hes writing then how does he pay for all this does he work at all do any pupils come to the house bene bene bene thank you are you well today fraulein lorl ahha siena macaroons my favourites give my best thanks to the baker what have you got for me today let me see ah here she comes fraulein lorl good morning what for im not leaving you i can keep going i assure you shall we try oh no im not tired at all yes you go fast yes sopranos up to f on the second voca thats wonderful i think so and thats all also identical first bassoon and tenor trombone what please just one moment yes i think so yes what time yes confutatis maledictis come lets begin oh yes what consigned to flames of woe the end of the recordare statuens in parte dextra then let us try together id regard it as such an honour tell me what is this work of course my dear friend it would be my greatest pleasure yes can i could i help you in any way finish what what man who shall i answer it what are you ill i do oh no it is a sublime piece the grandest operone i tell you you are the greatest composer known to me i would never miss anything that you had written you must know that no please you mean shes not coming back where is your wife im taking you home youre not well are you neglecting my request work fast and be sure to tell no one what you do you will see me again soon i am only a messenger do you accept you will be paid well a man who deserved a requiem mass and never got one a mass for the dead i have come to commission work from you you flatter me yes did my work please you mozart it was good of you to come grazie mio caro wolfgang i wouldnt presume all the same if it wouldnt be imposing i would like you to see my new piece it would be a tremendous honour for me i think you overestimate our dear viennese my friend do you know you didnt even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap i think its marvelous truly well i can speak for the emperor you made too many demands on the royal ear the poor man cant concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four i know its outrageous still if the public doesnt like ones work one has to accept the fact gracefully with all my heart mozart but there are those who have power over him i think ill take this up with the emperor how fortunate you burned the score why bother with orsinirosenberg hes obviously no friend of yours really why wolfgang what is it sta calmo per favore whats the matter i dont think you should become known in vienna as a debtor mozart however i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you and he has a daughter will that do what exactly are you working on forgive me we all have patriotic feelings of some kind cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum crema al mascarpone come come mozart im interested truly ah how exciting tell me more im afraid not of course not how is that possible you give concerts dont you i hear they are quite successful it has been said my friend that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means you dont mean to tell me you are living in poverty an implausible idea between you and me no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth no no no he has yet to achieve mediocrity herr sommer my dear mozart there is no one in the world i would rather help but now it is too late i have just come from the palace the post has been filled why didnt you come to me yesterday mozart this is a most painful situation yesterday i could have helped you today i cant im flattered and congratulations to you of course so you are how is your pretty wife herr mozart what brings you here how could i not dear mozart my sincere congratulations yes yes er on the whole yes majesty ah love well of course in italy we know nothing about that ah really yes in the third act excuse me didnt his majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera about the ballet incredible never mind ive seen the manuscript yes exactly mozart is writing a new opera an italian opera ive just learned something that might be of interest to you herr director indeed just a moment as a matter of fact i think i do know someone who could commission a work from him a very appropriate person to do so yes no baron no im afraid mozart is a lost cause he has managed to alienate practically the whole of vienna he is constantly drunk he never pays his debts i cant think of one person to whom i dare recommend him i agree baron come with me and stay in the room what does he want show her in then go to bed excuse me my dear who is she yes indeed goodnight to you all now it was perfection truly yes and congratulations to all of you it was superb bene of course oh yes hes just exhausted he became dizzy thats all we should let him rest well hes sleeping now better not yes i am looking after himin the pot i have got a good dinner not a sausage or

lot handsomer now dont you have enough blood already you always were sneaky stan very sneaky right think it over sister do you ever get lonely after vespers if you do why dont you give me a call im in the book youre absolutely right i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant im just weak sister im so weak i know sister but i have a very good excusethen she must have run out of the room and you found her when she saw the insects she passed out cold i carried her back to her room she was sleeping when i re entered the tunnel to look around ive spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels i shouldnt have let somebody like willie go in there with me even if they were trying to scare us away a devout hindu would never touch meat makes you wonder what these people are something magical a sacred rock the prime minister doesnt seem that naive youre hanging on better here than you did in america you think so its like the voodoo dolls of west africa the kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him no but i am interested in the occult and this is a kryta kali ma protects us now and for ever and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood yes i understand that was a misunderstanding the newspapers exaggerated the incident i was dubious myself at first then something connected the villages rock and the old legend of the sankara stones when they lost this rock their fields and animals died they also said their children were taken from them sorry i thought we were just talking about folklore you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them maybe but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace well i dont know we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again because of some ancient evil i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard yes very fine but not all of the pieces look old some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the goddess kali i had a question mr prime minister i was examining some of the maharajahs artifacts wed appreciate it if the maharajah would let us stay tonight well be on out way in the morning lost no were not lost were on our way to delhi this is miss scott and mr round my names indiana jones now what about the antidote lao whats that next time ill cut off more than his finger sure i found him then last night i had a little trouble somebody tried to slit my throat i dont like to show off lao she let up on the brake slow on the curves or well fly off the tracks come one whats wrong why legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow the village knew their rock was magic but they didnt know it was one of the lost sankara stones follow in the footsteps of shiva do not betray his truth okay shorty see you in the morning im going to have a little word with willie he was afraid of you he knows a tough guy when he sees one no you dont like him do you just a statue thats it pankot palace nope you got a little surprise over there shorty its just superstition shorty like a ghost story okay shorty you got the tickets short round step on it short round youre betrayed shiva mola ram youre about to meet kali in hell thats far enough nobody can say you dont have a vivid imagination thats what youve got these children these slaves digging for two are still missing nobodys perfect the way i heard it you stole one of them from a small village im sorry i dont know how i can help you here but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone and it had three lines painted across it the lines represent the three levels of the universe ive seen stones like the one you lost was the stone very smooth it was probably brought here from a sacred river nobody brought us here our plane crashed we were shot down by what evil i dont understand whats happened here hasnt the pankot palace been deserted since the mutiny of 1857 pankot isnt on the way to delhi its still a long way to delhi who knows what might happen well you didnt get your prince and there goes your diamond the last sankara stone not quite yeah this time youre gon na help let her go our only chance is outrunning them go theres got to be another way out no they wont kill me yes they believe you yes i dont blame you this hasnt been what youd call a fun vacation youve got to go to sleep now its okay youre all right now maybe someday not today im not leaving without those stones im going down quiet no the hearts still beating its a thuggee ceremony theyre worshipping kali the goddess of death and destruction willie thats it the release lever look inside a fulcrum release lever get us out willie shut up and listen theres got to be a fulcrum release look around willie open the door get us out of here willie willie come here hurry up were in trouble you

research on certain nocturnal activities wearing your jewels to bed princess no real food cheer up you lost your prince but dinners on the way maybe he likes older women ive always had a weakness for folk dancing any more complaints he said he couldnt take us any farther he has to go sell the elephants couldnt keep away huh i think you should sleep closer i meant for safety legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers its sanskrit it tells the story of sankara climbing mt kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago maybe yeah but hes got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years fortune and glory id like to find one of those myself what about the future by the way howd you end up in shanghai shortys family was killed when they bombed shanghai he was living on the streets i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket i know the feeling thats good youre doing fine whats happening keep stroking it pet it on the head go on pet it yes stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae okay i want you to lift your hand

to believe im not even sure i believe but if theres even a chance that spock has an eternal soul then that is my responsibility dont quote rules harry were talking about loyalty and sacrifice one man who died for us another who has deep emotional damage may i ask why why a natural desire to help finish the work we began but we had requested we were hoping to take her back to genesis admiral i dont understand the enterprise indisposed sir welcome aboard admiral dont be a fool give me your hand give me your hand and we both live if we dont help each other well all die here you fool look around

difficult what must i do bones sarek what if he melded with someone else please wait surely he would have found a way if there was so much at stake spock would have found a way but he couldnt touch me we were separated no kirk bathed with sweat suddenly shudders in pain sarek opens his eyes removes his hands he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers opens his eyes spock the needs of the few yes yes of course then how sir your son meant more to me than you can know id have given my life if it would have saved his you must believe me when i tell you that he made no request of me but why yes i was i saw no future then you know how bravely your son met his death sarek i would have come to vulcan to express my deepest sympathies ambassador i i had no idea you were here i think you know my crewbut at what cost your ship your son i am not sure only time will answer kirk i thank you what you have done is you will find a way kirk if you honor them both you must you must bring them to mount selaya on vulcan only there is the passage possible only there can both find peace one alive one not yet both in pain yes but how i see and i understand then everything that he was everything that he knew is lost and when i return home emptyhanded many shall mourn forgive me it is not here i assumed he had mindmelded with you it is the vulcan way when the bodys end is near i have been and always shall be your friend live long and prosper or the one the needs of the many outweigh he asked you not to grieve he spoke of your friendship kirk i must have your thoughts may i join your mind he would not have spoken of it openly because he asked you to he entrusted you with his very essence with everything was not of the body he asked you to bring him to us and to bring that which he gave you his katra his living spirit then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan you missed the point then and now only his body was in death kirk and you were the last one to be with him met his death how could you his friend have assumed that why did you leave him on genesis spock trusted you and you denied him his future spare me your human platitudes kirk i have been to your government i have seen the genesis information and your own report i will speak with you alone kirkits been a while sir here we go retrothrusters the planet vulcan in hailing distance sir we are clear

course admiral estimating spacedock in two point one hourshouston found it in the extraterrestrials suit recognize this shermin i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground were going damn well tell the press that there was an accident chemical warfare spill that cover can not be violated in any way understand me shermin shermin shermin what no deal youre a career intelligence officer shermin youll be in the air with us no we dont well do that but how are we going to hold him he can change himself into a man he can disappear youre not hearing me washington thinks its too late for that we have a new directive im taking over shermin you just do your job shermin well make the policy is that whats affecting your performance so far youve let it cross the heart of america for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security i dont see the humor in that i dont care where youre from you just cant disappear into thin air were growing very concerned back here theres no use pretending otherwise were rapidly approaching a condition red people are beginning to ask difficult questions im gon na be here if you need anything we dont know what else to do we need results dammit shermin earlier you were asking for help whats changed im afraid the situation demands that kind of risk oh shit clarify that why did you let it get into a populated area its in a green mustang when can we expect containment you have to were trying to contact the ship if we do ill let you know immediately good luck weve been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public its been decided not to expand the search at this time well get those answers when you find the one youre looking for we dont think thats necessarily bad at least its a point of contact contain it and get back to me im going to the white house right now ill try and get you everything you need get the body out of there load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson theyll take it from there we didnt expect this shermin is there any possibility that its a hoax could you be mistaken theres no mistake youre absolutely sure watch it theyre coming out okay you can speak to me mrs haydn im in charge of this operation now this is george fox mrs haydnthey must have picked it up in space its a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes major bell here sir we have to tell these people that were friendly that this whole thing was a mistake is anyone trying to contact the ship you have no conception of this do you jesus lyman youre an ignorant fool theyre gon na let some local cop blow him away im telling you theyre probably friendly nothing up there the grass is matted down in a few places but that could have been anything it was a man though right it was kind of like clicking maybe a language wasnt it yes twentyeight years it was only an accident that we discovered them we better get it into the box come on ive been investigating sightings for seventeen years mr shermin this ones real we have a dead extra terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive weve been visited its finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how were going to deal with these beings the better off were going to be after i called in i had a chance to sit down with the three locals they swear theres another one that didnt make the ship it might be alive no sir radar we had a flight of f16s play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour then it shot straight up and disappeared waitll you see it no not on the landscape were trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but its hard going very beautiful country up herei just retired george do you hear me george im afraid we cant let you go youre talking about taking a life the most unique life form on this planet i think were better than that then youre going to have to do it without me thats the chance we have to take you can change a directive george youve done it before listen to me hes going somewhere in death valley lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop east is the nuclear site there are no roads in there she was teaching him to hitchhike im telling you we block the four roads into death valley and we got him ive never been taken off an assignment in my life give me twenty four hours and ill have him for you we dont have to do it that way we can catch him this time whats all this for hello george im not being unpatriotic and im doing my damndest to catch them bells up on 80 and im down here on 70 past grand junction theyre heading west if theyre not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them all im asking is that you people think about it maybe look this is just something to think about from what i got at the shopping center it was more scared than anything else i dont feel its as big a threat as you think it is george listen to what youre saying this things changed itself into a man disappearing may not be that big a deal ill make this as simple as i can george they disappeared youll get results one way or the other thats for sure okay its messy the things got a gun were just asking for somebody to get killed i dont like it george you
