question but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question but last monthi dont know if youve heard about this but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts was he involved at all do you think in occultism or satan worship well ive had a hard time getting an actual verification a stephen

when you are and what are the maumaus going to do for us today whats your name that can be done gentlemen the show our show will be satirical you know what that is dont you trust me on this one and this is manray youll both get an advance and you can stay with me different first things first i have to know if manray is up for this i have this concept for a tv pilot theres no guarantee it will get made but regardless youll still make some money no offense sloan and i have been looking all over for you delacroix good morning cheeba no costume no blackface manray im very sorry about ya boy cheeba and sloan believe me it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her just lookin out for a brother i feel you all this stuff happenin at once but you cant let if affect your work you got ta be professional how you sound mantan you have to start getting into your character i want you to start using the name mantan and not manray if you dont mind youre now mantan i would like to change your name thats right money turns the wheel trust me of course i still have to pitch it to my boss but well have an answer one way or the other some tap dancing some singing eureka manray sloan says youre too talented to be dancing on the street can i finish thank you i had a great aunt we called her sister she went to her grave not believing man had walked on the moon dont you people get it were in the 21st century slavery was over four hundred years ago all that stuff people talked in the old days its over folks always crying white man this white man that lets all grow up yes and i say yes because who is to judge who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not who who can play god because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country gary i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show its when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist thats when i get mad no one in any way shape or form should be censored i gots to go its my moms hello mommy let me get rid of this other call hold on a sec i got a call this has to be a big mistake funnier to who and at whos expense dunwitty when negroes start to run amok the boycotts when the demostrations commence im giving them your home address lets see how you like it when they picket your lawn in greenwich connecticut i dont give a good goddamn about finland norway sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from i will not be held responsible for these revisions these changes are not the way i want to go this is an outrage this is a sham a violation dunwitty dont leave in the immortal words of derrick coleman whooopdeedamndoo thats exactly my point has he even directed actors before in anything what are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky madonna video besides what does he know about negroes youre telling me some white boy is gon na direct this pilot i was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself if not the pilot soon after i strongly feel that a negro should direct this this kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm one misstep and were doing amos and andy only a negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain we think so i dont know about that plantation angle in the projects like eddie murphys the pjs do we have characters how about honeycutt snowflake rastus nigger jim sambo jungle bunny and how could we forget aunt jemima mantan right here is a gifted hoofer he has educated feet negroes would be in an uproar protest finally forced amos and andy off the air could stop us from ever getting on yep you guessed it mantan is an uneducated negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire ignorant dullwitted lazy and unlucky every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons mantan and sleep n eat the dusky duo mantan and sleep n eat two real coons i know were way out there but its satire i dont know if whoopi is the way to go it will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the cns to get this on the air in fact i would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque too controversial it is called mantan the new millennium minstrel show so lets take this great form this very american tradition of entertainment into the 21st century into the new millennium i know youre familiar with minstrel shows they came about at the turn of the 19th century it was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface singing dancing telling jokes doing skits dunwitty i ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air carol burnett heehaw ive done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right in my previous work its been all surface superficial i have never really dug deep not anymore as mark twain fully understood satire is the way race has always been a hot button in this countrys history and it needs to be pushed harder if we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony its about promoting racial healing were all happy to be here and im going to paint a picture for you its right and tight good morning let me introduce you to everybody you know my assistant sloan what is it you want from me some plantation follies some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads you want me to go back to the ante bellum days im not sure if i can deliver what you want im an oreo a sell out because i dont aspire to do homeboys from out of space secret diary of desmond pfeiffer a pjs or some as you might put it some nigger show im a tom im whiter than white and youre blacker than black is that what you think ive never been given a fair shot to white i still feel all of my scripts would make good shows i dont agree the negro middle class does exist and its rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom i would prefer you not use that word in my presence i understand but again in all honesty i was not informed cp time is colored peoples time the stereotypical belief that negroes are always late that negroes have no sense of time time except when it comes to music or dance i wasnt told about this until marie informed me as soon as i got off the elevator four minutes ago i didnt find out about this very important staff meeting until i love you too daddy lets get him over to the bed i didnt mean that in life where do you go from here nuthin i cant handle the same old same old trying to get my stuff through another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back daddy it cant be just because of that there had to be other factors thats what im askin how did you end up here i thought you had promised mommy you stopped daddy shes younger than me pleased to meet you its been a long time its me peerless i want to speak with you he never showed it dont tell him its from me or he wont take it so whats up with you so he drank himself into a stuper how long has my father been like this is that so give me the gun i didnt think this was in your studies at nyu and thats how you got me in the first place otherwise i trust you know the difference youre an intelligent woman finished at nyu the first and only time a big mistake im gon na have to ask you not to see mantan anymore this is crazy you can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody i know where i made my big mistake i have a general rule never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you light do you have to be so damn forthright dunwitty and i feel youve been getting too close to him getting his mind all messed up oh is he you getting jiggy with mantan that crazy brother of yours doesnt think so how long have you and hambone been hangin out whyd you do that how so is that good or bad thanks the jolly nigger bank for what what is this a small victory isnt that small when youve been use to losing what would their reaction be i hadnt the foggiest whos side are you on cmon you were only doing what family is supposed to be doing for family you gave your brother a shot thats all anybody can ask for an opportunity a chance a shot he got his same here what do you want me to say your life will never be the same just want to say good luck im gon na slit my wrists cut my throat for the love of joseph which one is your brother ive never worked with any of you and youve never worked with me so well be starting from scratch im a fair person a straight shooter and i dont hold my tongue everybody up in here should know i had nothing to do with you being hired good morning for those of you who dont know me im pierre delacroix im running things and this here is my assistant sloan hopkins i wouldnt bet against it my negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place even if money wasnt an issue dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous it was the principle dunwitty had to be enlightened i was making a point i take pride in my work plus i already told you i wasnt gon na walk away from my money my problem is mantan the new millenium minstrel show i feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer this is cheeba manray better not be bleeding to death i need him after were done he can do whatever he wants to do until then hes ours and lose out on my money the only way i get paid is if i get fired and thats what i intend to do good im going to need your support you getting cold feet the point being that him the networks dont want black people on television unless they are buffoons dunwitty wants a coon show and thats what im going to give him its going to be so racist so negative he wont have the balls to put it on the air hence ill prove my point not yet but this thing will never get made manray was under our nose the whole time how can this be you and me at the same time the exact same thought its scary how did you know manray what good are you if you dont tell me stuff like this why didnt you tell me about this staff meeting david i appreciate your comments anybody got an ideas everybody just talk out loud this thing was rigged the deck was stacked the fix was in could don king be near good thing sloan had my back shes my rock this was going to be a whole lot of work oh is that what im doing hi mona yes your name kook and the gang its manray lets do the taping you go back to your dressing room get dressed and blacken up mantan we got a show to tape do i have to spell it out for you in fact go ask sloan yourself let me ask you a question if i may how do you think she got the job in the first place i dont mean to burst your bubble mantan the marvelous but sloan is an opportunity oh is it buddy boy in this business if people dont produce they get fired you shouldnt even be mad at me over sloan and now is definitely not the time to bitch up youve made it from the guttermost to the uppermost dont you know you should never let them see you sweat yknowwhatimsayin you getting scared because some people dont like what you are doing what are you a man or a mouse are you a punk punking out on me in time no joke serious tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal besides there is no such thing as bad publicity this is nothing it will blow over by tomorrow so they can be on tv not nervous relaxed you feel good not nervous can i kiss you too now im privileged why because i didnt grow up on food stamps and welfare because i didnt call home a cardboard box no i never ever went to bed hungry and im proud of it too whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you i didnt mean it to sound like that im happy for all of us its just we have a great responsibility now the pressure is on soon if and when he calls please dont forget to ask him if hes seen mantan not at all yes i have very hard has daddy called you going to attack me too the show is a hit arent you happy for me cmon mommy daddy hasnt been impressed with anything ive ever done from winning my fifth grade spelling bee to the present its gon na be hard for me to get away with the show taking off i dont even know why youre still concerned over him daddys not with you i cant go all the way down south where is he he said that ill be right over please let me know when you hear from daddy get a number or something to answer your question there are a lot of negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons i know whats on my birth certificate you heard from daddy mommy please dont call me that it was it is but this is a different kind of show cant beat it with a hammer well since you asked it looks like i may have a new show a pilot being shot cmon mommy dont start with that im an ungrateful son stuff it looks delicious good luck jukka do a good show this is a travesty a debacle this is a tv show not a music video how did you get this gig well before there was black or african american there were negroes im a negro did you just ask me whats a negro im a negro a fiasco a disaster a boondoggle an

replacement ordered 12 shows were on in 3 weeks didya hear what i just said yo i seriously doubt that will ever happen didnt i tell you i know your people better than you do but if by some miracle youre correct im gon na invite them inside my house and well have a sit down discuss it like civil human beings we just punched it up a bit made it funnier calm down please im gon na leave you two creative geniuses alone derrick coleman he possessed all the talent in the world coulda shoulda been a great ballplayer but alas dc didnt want it bad enough delacroix do you want it bad enough to kill for it do you want it that much no just meet the guy thats all im asking look ill even let you choose your own musical director you can have that if spielburg can direct the color purple and amistad our whiz kid can direct the mantan pilot probably nuthin but thats why its such a sexy way to go sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook a different unique perspective a black director yknow what hes gon na do given the subject matter with this kid the possibilities are endless i just want you to meet him keep an open mind i want a hot young white director maybe the kid that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy madonna video to hire someone solely on their ethnicity gender or religion is not right its unamerican i will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job

paris hold its plane let memphis take care of it let somebody down the line clean up your mess the point of fedex as i understand it is to make the damn connection im touched but i might not have it was fifteen minutes late howd it go what do you expect from the guy who stole a kids bicycle when his truck broke downim accused of using some government wagons to ship personal property unfortunately ill never get the chance im leaving in an hour for congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion wasting my time naturally look at her teasing those bumpkins i wish she was beneath me well now theres something worth dying for what do you think they always say that these men were taken from their homes at night tried by reeds courts which congress recognizes and well you can see they love reed and his inquisition i think they hope to share in his disgusting profits its becoming the american way that scum joseph reed theyre calling him the king of pennsylvania the mans a budding cromwell he condemns rich tories to death and then appropriates their property for himself naturally the pig hates me for every tory ive saved im sure his dogs will be overjoyed there then you can have sort of a normal life gates he used my battle plan and i humbly submit that without me hed still be back at saratoga waiting for the british to attack george why havent you moved into the potts house back at the creek much more befitting of a commander and chief than your field tent and you could entertain i think you need to entertain more seriously get a few new jersey whores up here invite some congressmen couldnt hurt that cant be same old story while theyre strung out well george who were you well truth be told i was a pharmacist alexander after visiting congress i know what its like being violated by come disproportionate asses ah if she only knew that the most important men in the country possibly the world are sitting at this table christ george joseph reeds been writing letters back to congress attacking you your own aide someday george you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what congress thinks that is it may come down to us or them someday you or them cicero was right was is a time when the laws are silent the army can survive without me what do you think george shall i resign its what they want it is congress is talking openly about replacing you with lee the mans waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief but trust you to do what one side in congress wants compromise another glorious battle some surrender some of course just want power and money but if you dont mind my asking george what are your plans oh they have reasons theres a lot of confusion these days congress has picked up its skirts and is racing for baltimore theyre not waiting for spring of course they still had time to deny my promotion even john adams voted against it ive come to report that weve had a bit of luck it comes down to leaders if our leaders are ordinary men who truly believe if they go into the forests with the troops eat what they eat fight with them perhaps to die the most common soldier will defy your most depressing expectation and a french alliance well you fought with them against the french and iroquois how good were they then exceedingly besides if i had half the wagons that were used to lug the rum to philadelphia for this congress i could move a whole army to the moon over three hundred miles i capture quebec leading an army by river fordings through maine if we dont do it the british will come down champlain take back ticonderoga and attack us in the spring weve got to attack the british now have they put you in charge yet do we have an army yet what is happeningcongress has been using our supply wagons for years to ship their black market goods probably their whores what does she see in them hmmm shes beneath me im afraid some say that hessians are invincible thats why the people trust you george without someone at the convention who has the people behind him everything will fail will you do it george youre the only man the people trust trust with power they know you wont betray them have you decided if you are going to join the virginia delegation to the constitutional convention yes i believe so march on philadelphia get joseph reed and the pigs in congress the speculators whove grown fat off the war get them all sweep them aside he warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people even if it was against congress george the time has come for you to declare yourself king of america listen to me the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne george you must declare yourself with us or against us george remember that night when we were drinking with arnold no one knows congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and can not pay the soldiers pensions i am not conscious of it sir but since you have thought it necessary to tell me so we part sir arnold is a traitor sir i think no such thing yessir general greene is here there are two other divisions here what are we going to do they go back home to keep their families alive stay into the spring to plant then they start coming back to us are you going to keep him sir i was a clerks apprentice on saint croix but then i went to kings college its a wonder they find the british cause worth dying for but its what he said just before they killed him i regret that i have but one life to give to my country with pleasure and an honor did you hear about nathan hale general washington is there actually going to be a compromise i mean a deal with england well sir then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear therefore retreat excuse me general but may i ask how do you feel delighted sir ill be twenty next year sir weve got powder but no ball captain alexander hamilton sirunofficially general greene congress is bitterly opposed to allowing negroes in the army the british army sir general lee is detained captain no officer is going to get these men to fight they had the life crushed out of them on long island at the most perhaps we could make a feint at an outpost then retire to protect congress did god ever make such a pitiful army if he isnt then hes stupid well i shall deny him to you he is evil on earth the man is a traitor understand you need to be listening to people like john adams and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind and hamilton greene george im afraid if you go through with this madness i must tender my resignation as your aide i see where were headed youre putting your trust in the likes of hamilton and arnold but the hessians are there no one can beat them thats why cornwallis stationed them there they have the post of honor they are invincible no i did not really well what the hell is a deist precisely what do you mean youre not a christian of course youre a christian were all christians to assert the rights of our founding fathers this country was colonized by christians this shall become a christian revolution surely as a good christian you understand that a ground swellchristian movement george you see well george congress just passed a resolution censuring arnold for destruction of government property i wouldnt cast my fate with that man that damned arnold is here isnt he did you know he lost all his ships outrageous and completely unacceptable george so good to be back i understand george what can he do the british have massive superiority spies from quebec confirm that the british are sending an entire fleet down lake champlaini feel the same sir general lee sir my baby daughter has died my baby mon petite henriette like flowers after the snow melts yes i will write him and tell his ministers and the court i rode here on my horse sir these are our finest firearms from the armory at charleville they are a gift from the people of france muskets and uniforms and bayonets i only meant i am then i understand you too serve without salary you know since your charming little victories at trenton and princeton the french court is softening i expect any time now a ship load of supplies mon general i have come here to learn and to give not to take i am serving without salary i they look both the same uh none just now but sir please accept my commission from congress and you must see this portrait of my beautiful wife adrienne we had the most perfect little baby girl just before i left her name is henriette but general i assure you my motives are sincere however through my relations with members of his majestys court i am a representative of the french government whose deepest desire is to be one people united with our american brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of king george of england vive la france vive lameriquewhats the difference we already have black soldiers in our army the british army is right back there across that river sir i think it must be something else that detains general lee detained by what i hear general lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in new york why wont he come on these men have suffered but i believe they will fight i doubt arnold will be afraid if the constitution is ratified well have a country theyll want to elect you president of the convention which means president of the country it is we need you george yes sir its a wise idea sir i have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform im honored but reluctant to leave you what the hell are we doing then maybe i do see what youre after perhaps you get to chose again but you are an aristocrat and a slave owner sir no were all of us after something its easy for me to fight for the common man my father could only dream that i would be a general someday and what of my daughter or son i know what im after but now with all this talk about compromise it means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope sir if you dont mind my saying i dont understand your history at all i mean why would you want to win the war youre not after glory like benedict youre a slave owner and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army theyre just disgusting jealous bottomfeeding swine its their nature im with captain hamilton you wrong me general i am an officer and a horseshoer well sir i was an ironmaster before you got me maybe i will let you down yet sir congress hasnt issued their pay for two months many have not eaten properly for at least that long youre being a little hard on them dont you think yes but ive spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history and i read the lives of caesar alexander hannibal sir im volunteering you the wholehearted support of the rhode island army i have commanded the rhode island militia for a year now my father is an ironmaster as was i i was born with a limp sir the militia used to hate it when i marches with them because my pike would always sway i im possessed of the idea of a command in your army sir colonel washington colonel nathanael greene rhode island militia yessir were leaving themcut those men down congress is pushing ahead with your courtmartial benedict trust me to handle this you go too far benedict couldnt you have appealed to congress the point being hes also a candidate for my job if we can pull this off maybe i can restore their faith in me have you heard the british are negotiating to make a trade for general lee as soon as the men have good shelters ill move perhaps martha will join me this winter theres this whispering campaign against me ever since gates won at saratoga there was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at congress which says i am personally responsible for all our hardships and that i have encouraged the people of america to make me into a god benedict it says that i have gone mad theyre ready believe me the ones that stayed on here at valley forge are ready for anything of course we get nothing from congress they need boots coats we desperately need food exactly wed attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard it would cause the line to buckle then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half our plan is to hit them as they leave i you all know my history were so damned important look at us nathanael you were a horse shoer benedict before this i hope i never have to believe that then i need you we all do without your victory the men would have no hope at all the army needs you dont do anything rash please benedict is that a fact go on i want to hear everything were in bad shape benedict moral is low before i can do anything i need lee and his seven thousand troops ive ordered him to join us three times in my last letter i all but begged him to come here the man is insubordinate they dont trust me thats the truth isnt it sam adams never did why in hell would john do that why in hell would any of them do that after all youve done its unbelievable damnit youve given us a whole new season benedict and congress thinks that the british are going to ride right over us come spring now half their army is back in canada arnold ben franklins going to paris but i think the french will be long on talk and short on guns our troops are mobs they wont take orders have no equipment could they beat the british they died well otherwise they didnt do much right but if we have war the british will surely send their best troops right now they have no other enemies whats your frank estimation of the british you seem pleased by the prospect youd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness patience colonel arnold active personalities terrify these men but congratulations on your victory at ticonderoga well what have you thought wil i want to remind you of a conversation we started just before monmouth youd have money every year so you wouldnt have to work you can stay at mount vernon as long as you want wil im giving you your freedom do you understand youve served me loyally year after year without complaining ive thought hard about you this past winter i want to free you wil i want to give you your freedom after this battle is fought wil yes william i am apologizing what what are you talking about misunderstood what none of the servants is to touch a gun you know that you are never never to touch my guns do you understand tell mrs washington i am compelled to stay a while longer marquis get these men reformed send steuben and wayne out on the left who is that what do you know about these men they can stand against anything theyve seen more war than most field generals they are not cowards sir they are not afraid what the goddamned hell do you think you are doing lafayette will not be happy general lee welcome back im happy youve decided to join us youre asking me to be president of a republic not king not a dictator over subjects but its more than just that am i right im not sure well if its my last order then i order them to be there tell them i will give them my decision then i want to address the officers all the officers next friday can we arrange it at the mess whats your advice alexander is this a coup alexander are you trying to tell me that i might be assassinated if i dont agree to hell with arnold this is a declaration of insurrection who wrote this what is this i must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect dont lie to me hamilton if i had not courtmartialed arnold did you know that arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked you realize what would happen if this fort fell the whole hudson would be open to them colonel hamilton anyone who served under arnold i want them shipped north i dont want any troops here who served under arnold get the body of our army up to greenes vanguard as fast as we can all the damned fool has to do is hit the british rearguard and then hold for us its impossible to stop these men deserting in winter you might as well stop geese from migrating we better congress invented him to learn to shoot cannon theyre among the best divisions the british have no conscripts no impressed recruits just professional killers that young school teacher i heard the british hung him as a spy captain i want you to know that i respect your openness it would make me happy if youd join our table for dinner from now on and is that the most horrible thing in the world im so inclined no one wants to turn the table on the enemy more than i but if victory is remote and theres any hope for a negotiated peace we must keep this army intact ill expect you for dinner this evening captain hamilton for christs sake have a bath how old are you captain then use rocks hamilton youre going to have to cover our asses as we cross who the hell knows everyones giving orders its all very democratic the last i heard a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on breeds hill with one stroke the british could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it horatio horatio gates of course you know john adams of the massachusetts delegation is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went of course the army will acquit him thats not the point arnold is a man and will understand what i need to understand is john sam what is happening here who are those people in there the fat ones in silk lafayette is my friend he believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind so of course hes a child but he would have died before he would have let me down if he supports the british why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them unlike general lee who you and congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent i think many would like to see him commanderinchief i dont know delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things and if hes popular with his men as does your ability horatio we must talk further when its more convenient well john adams your cousin has a marvelous gift are you all going insane benedict arnold the man who stopped the british on lake champlain who carried the day at saratoga goddamnit joseph you own two mansions ride in an expensive tory coach you are all nothing but a pack of greedy pigs arnold is indispensable do you understand i need arnold to help me win this war how can you say that gentlemen let me get to the point i cant see the wisdom of pursuing this old courtmartial against general arnold joseph are you afraid to cross that river with me i accept your resignation with regret you have leave to return to philadelphia they help me understand why we fight how many generals do we have like arnold hes got guts hes vain and he fights they are also very religious so we will attack them three days from now on christmas one force under me and another to the south under colonel cadwalader i mean im a deist a belief i share with the likes of tom jefferson and ben franklin surely you knew that no as a matter of fact i havent the slightest idea what youre talking about a grand scheme joseph the british spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges in my opinion he saved my army colonel reed if we have any hope for a compromise or truce with england now we have to hold on here our men must believe they can win the british must believe that somehow in some mad impossible way we might actually be able to hurt them my god they mean to finish us what about arnold hes up there a fleet any word from canada i will continue with our french allies concentrating on new york get these men back in line my god who ordered this retreat what is it marquis when the snow melts mon petite marquis i suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red british soldiers because if the british got off their asses and came up here now we would be smashed and the revolution would be finished tell king louis its that bad chose another any general worth anything should have a brace of horses well we will accept these charming little gifts when we see them meanwhile please take your pick of a horse and how rusty are these muskets these supplies charming little victories please dont expect much more of us monsieur you must be very rich no please an advance on your salary the one with philadelphia spelled correctly is the counterfeit continentals congress paper money it was worthless to start with but as you see counter feiters have made them even less than worthless can you tell which one is fake gentlemen my i introduce a french gentleman recently appointed major general by congress marie joseph paul yves roch gilbert du motier marquis de lafayette general lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen and how many cases of muskets mon petite marquis what i want to know is sir where is your daddy we have more officers created by congress than we know what to do with i want you to see our hospital come out and meet my soldiers theyre good people martha for gods sake our kind what is that supposed to mean these men are all i have left and they stay because they will fight they desire it they seek it of course virginia is terrified for my soldiers this is a war to obliterate the upper class from the face of the earth should i tell them all to go home because if they win it will ruin me it is impossible for me to imagine that negroes are fighting so that only white men may be free if we win this war they will own this country too is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men its damned condescending whats the point of a revolution if it doesnt to win this war i need an army martha what what else from virginia i think i heard that thats right when i was a young man we used to recite cato we would come together recite it like they were words from heaven devotion to country duty purity of heart purity of heart i was drunk on something then liberty virtue country thats from cato you know that play about the noble romans as i was riding up to philadelphia i found myself thinking about the old days but as usual it will not go well for them martha you must trust me everything if we force britain into concessions it will open up the western lands and that would be a boon for our family we already have more slaves than we need but we need more land the day tom jefferson frees a slave ill ride naked through the streets of williamsburg on a mule tom jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small the only man out there who really does what he says is sam adams and everyone thinks hes crazy believe me this disturbance isnt going to last long you have to understand congress is a chicken coop full of foxes martha each and every one has his eye on a nice fat prize dont be ridiculous of course that wont happen im very aware of that the eternal dream of the disenfranchised my dear a classless world not a very real expectation of course if it were that simple these people theyre after something else our beloved father the king also refuses to bend surely you knew this was coming its another demonstration against the king this is the wildest yet you know i came back to mount vernon to retire i dont need to be in government well this must be about something theyre for my bodyguard i have an absolute conviction that arnold is planning to have me assassinated it will be harder if i am surrounded by a body of men who look like me dont you think nathanael im sending you to virginia to head the southern army to harass cornwallis marquis you must go with him youve got to stop them here or our whole line will cavein its all right boys im here at one time i could have chosen not to be i will not betray you nathanael you dont believe i can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism you have a free tongue captain hamilton yes i thought thats how youd feel nathanael general greene i certainly didnt mean you of course you are a gentleman an officer and a gentleman nathanael someone bred to station bred to being a gentleman unlike these men his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs the only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them fifty lashes each a horseshoer but you do come from a military family it isnt my army yet colonel greene looks like youve seen some action did you hurt your leg in a fight yes yes happy to meet you theyre finished they cant help us anymore theyve done their duty general greene now you do yours we cant take them are you all right really which precious homily was it i remember a pair of young philosophers once who laughed at the world id throw everything away for you perhaps youve been counting my acres mrs fairfax and discovered exactly how poor i really am thats a lie but not more than your comfort you know very well who it is that i love god damn you sam adams you wanted a revolutionary army and now that weve really got one it scares you more than it does the british that i hear a mob unemployed drunkards vagabonds the worlds dregs are these philosopher going to be here to help you fight your war you know why i dont trust revolutions because each of us is who we are we make speeches print pamphlets and we never change the world is not a philosophical abstraction mister adams its us and i dont believe you can ever change human nature i see who says so just because they are born that land belongs to the strongestthats good who im lost in ecstasy and dost thou love thou charming maid they can use their imaginations youre out of your mind what are you doing i think i will disappoint you what else should i become theres no difference between virginia and england i must be educated if im to take my place in society my father couldnt afford to send me to england for school he made a shambles of our fortunes everyone laughs at me well we must be who we must be its the freest land on earth i think america suits you i always though london was the place to be capital of the world the most spectacular city on earth then why are you teaching me what do you really think of the minuet anyway cranes who needs to walk like a crane or civilized sally our slave system is a british law slavers capture them and bring them here africa of course william weve been studying hard i really know my stuff juba was a numidian this this is life indeed life worth preserving such life as juba never felt till now though sometimes we get frost and that can cut the seasonwhat have i got now its exactly as if there were two emperors because of this the people have two minds he is their champion damn him i should have killed him on the front i let you talk me out of that lykas pick a man someone who will look good jerses i want it built up in the daily action send them out i am their hero i want that bastard dead tell lykas to send a retiarius and a samnite to help tiger yes go on but i get what i want always dont i now that were done with that infatuation forever now that is a happy sound tomorrow i want the citizens my people back in the arena the gods know im tired come to bed now tonight were celebrating what is that wailing you must start clearing everything with me especially your lovers where have you been i have to come back if i dont come back the people will think im a coward tribuus tomorrow he dies i want his blood on the sand do you understand tribuus tomorrow kill him tribuus execute that bastard for the gods spit it out how about in the forum right in front of the senate its disgusting animals i had to come here under armed guard slaves get this junk out of my sight i want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house if its worth something then sell it let some time pass then ask quietly without anyone knowing it comes from me did narcissus die today wasnt this his day to die i should at least have you dont you think they hate me they really hate me dont they why then theyll notice when im gone well im making a public appearance arent i quite so narcissus and his courageous men may they live long to serve rome oh stay dont you want to join the chorus of praises for narcissus glory just remember he is a married man more wine sister surely you can drink more than that will you please get back in your wagon and stay there were nearly there lucilla endorse me in public do that and ill make you rich and set you free ill return your estates i know you would give anything to be outside again endorse me and you will be free think of it what would you do with your freedom the army is a problem they love you you have led them from victory to victory in the name of rome and they love you and after all youre just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty who could fault you for that thus have i reached a compromise with the senate over your fate instead of executing you im sending you to rome where you will be tried cooperate and they will be returned to your estate i could have executed you they wont break this one im ordering a general standdown in preparation for withdrawal back across the danube that this illness has clouded his mind being as close im certain youve noticed what we all have noticed you and my father have become very close perhaps one day i may say the same for us do we really need to repair this fort it seems like an expensive undertaking i propose we burn it to the ground that way if the germans cross the danube here there will be nothing to help them build an offensive position i would say theres nothing more dangerous than a man who knows what right is oh but with the army behind you you could become extremely political not a republican by any chance or perhaps into a new one but heres to your god and the courage of our legions then youd be out of a job thats difficult to say general of course but not now however if he continues to be unwell you may report to me welcome back from your great triumph narcissus meridas my father sends his heart felt praise sadly marcus is in dark humors nothing to worry about but he needs rest likely just the weather i wouldnt know who to bet on take grain away from the army give away food so am i maybe itll crush gaius throw it down into the streets down into the forum if its my father they want then give him to them at the opening of the month of janus i will ask this noble body to confirm my emperorship gods of hell this must cost a fortune how many days is this going to go on ignore that the sooner we leave this disgusting place the better how can they who else is there i have no heir quintus will tell the army that you are being called to rome to celebrate your victory they will hear that you are living in luxury he will let them feel you have betrayed them for the good life and soon the army wont even remember your name underdog how can he be an underdog he wins all the time im the emperor why cant i kill him he could be poisoned or somehow killed to look like an accident this is the only place in rome where i thought i believed i was wholly in power i met with falco and the senators have agreed to call for a truce with the germans he left us at dawn im certain father will be in better humors by then now honor us with your presence at dinner ill join you as soon as i see my fathers physician we need more statues perhaps i should open medical clinics for the poor citizens only though tribuus go left here i want to see my new statue at via claudia jerses tomorrow why isnt he dead damn you you promised me he would be dead tribuus what happened in the arena was narcissus killed where is my fatherif you set me free i will find my way back to the army march on rome and depose you then the army and i will restore the republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again on what charge and my army would have thrown your body into the danube where is my family apparently my opinion wasnt needed forgive me caesar but do two senator represent the mood of the whole senate or the will of the roman people besides every truce we make with the germans they break we have to stop the germans now caesar you flatter me caesar but theyre not destroyed not yet the dangerous man caesar is the man who doesnt care i back rome against all her enemies if that answer disappoints you im not a politician gladly caesar perhaps master galen you may say do you expect marcus to be well enough by morning for an audience respectfully caesar quintus and i must report its time for you to tell the citizens that commodus stole the money allocated for defending the german border its time to tell the citizens everything will you write it proximo we need to talk about my one third i imagine the betting booths will be doing good business and what was the name of that olive oil company the emperor and i are bound by the threads of the fates he was born on august thirtyfirst you know my birth sign is water bearer twentyfifth day in the month of janus thats their job isnt it to argue so i think my case will be long on talk and short on action my only visits to rome senator have been through books but the wars over time to close the door of war once and for all ive read of it i believe we are arriving in an enlightened age an age of peace that will bring rome her greatest glory thanks to marcus aurelius the battle was won today and i prefer to believe it was a gift of janus the eldest god of rome god of my ancestors i hope you live to see what i believe the senate too we all know what right is senator a republican is a man who strives to create equality among all classes at the core hes a man who believes in doing whats right i would venture with all respect the emperors health is the business of every soul in the empire you dont know how wrong you are i need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing when the senate and the emperor agree miracles can happen youre hearing about somebody else they cant if this is rome fools to let us both live well be our own best witnesses at our trial why you where are they he killed his father and then my family would that marcus had lived but what if i wish to be purple to think i brought my daughters up on all things roman read to sleep on catullus lucretius virgil every night my beautiful daughters twenty years ive led men to die for me it was the glory of rome but that was something if it wasnt that then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore but that was something these men here are butchered for laughs their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line you mean a symbol of someone who doesnt exist yours will do i dont believe that hes got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron you know were preparing for a fullblown invasion of germany why do you play at being drunk im not fit for the job and as a matter of fact im not taking the job sneaking around with your brother only from a distance no futuretelling please ive been terrified enough for one day ill do anything in my power to help you restore the republic but i cant be that power they fear me marcus you honor me but im a soldier politics scare the hell out of me youre too hard on him he is a strong young man with you as his guide so i understand commodus is just a young man hell learn what you had to learn hes like you sir too tough for the gods to swallow theres no reason to say that everyone knows youre going to be well i had servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light i will marcus but youre going to be well enough to direct it yourself the fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when theyre most vulnerable on my honor as your daddy as soon as i can dont stop to visit take the children straight home and ill follow as soon as i can much more colorful than the ones we wear and of course less dented can you stop that slaughter can you free these men then give the empire back to the people the children who will grow up to become senators quintus youve got at least a division with you we could take rome away from commodus and give it back to the senate its your job as a roman officer to disobey such a summons you brought the army into rome on his death bed i promised marcus i would complete our work here the senate may be vacillating but i have the army behind me im taking half a cohort and restocking that fort well they die for it rome is going to pay tribute like a defeated nation begging for mercy have you told your troops that what deal centurions on both sides of the river are convinced the germans will try one last offensive theyve got nothing to lose and its so very like them why dont we try to keep politics out of the conversation what the hell was all that about lets hope he doesnt start giving orders thats what im going to do thats what im going to do theyll have me teach them dont let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history without philosophy without meaning teach them of the greeks the babylonians the hebrews the numidians the egyptians and the great romans teach them who we are ill never die you tell the girls that you honor our ancestors and ill be there every night at the table of life do you want to see themis and manto butchered if i die fighting commodus he wont care about you if i live ill come and get you how long do you think commodus will let us live once hes in power a month half a year paestum will be a prison where hell hold us until its time when you get to ostia use this bribe passage to africa or spain save my family you should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to egypt then to numidia what you dont want to imagine is the things ive done me well i believe in rome youd have to after what ive seen how people outside the empire treat each other quintus is overly idealistic i want to come home of course i do id have to be mad not to want that its just that marcus trusts me im a soldier were at war i cant stay home tending the damned olive groves very fancy did you design the bottle this is our oil from our estates if you win you know you have to stay its the losers who get to go home besides im not so sure it is over centurions report enemy scouts probing our lines i can see that of course what about their philosophy lessons greeks hes very realistic commodus must hate you free your gladiators and come with us i want nothing to do with the arena you were a soldier and then a gladiator werent you i want another interview with cos tell him to bring plenty of ink before they leave get gold then get a large cash advance no tell them ill do it but i want more posters all over rome they want to dump tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot right they dont waste time how much money is involved such nobility from such an ignoble mouth take my advice and make that bet tell me honestly since this may be our last earthly meeting if this were a fair fight where would you put your money pressures on eh proximo theres got to be a load of money in this why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window spend my days beheading country bumpkins i dont know proximo who has better wine than you besides im beginning to think of the colosseum as my home as what the galloping gladiator so i pretend im dead you get gold what do i get what the hell are you talking about greek make us rich proximo make us very rich lucky it didnt step on his head proximo if this is her doctor hes an assassin alive im alive what would the poster say narcissus would kill for a taste of golden pompeii olive oil i didnt get killed and everyone else did im not a gladiator i refuse to fight i refuse to be your slave i refuse take your hands off me animal death is a very light thing for you thank you what is going to happen tomorrow exactly impossible every citizen has a right to trial this is rome condemned arent i owed a trial before being condemned who the hell are you i killed too many barbariansyou know there were riots last night now the unrest has started again and commodus has sent for an army division you understand what you are doing agh please hes having a secret device constructed for the circus the brass craftsmen are working overtime cos what in hades is the emperor up to and dont tell me you dont know commodus hes a gladiator is he mad this is cos this precocious young man a scribe for the daily action ive invited him to write a small piece about you are you mad with all this unrest the colosseum will be open day and night anyway im not political im in the entertainment business something else then do the chariot races interest you lets talk about this later right now we have other things to settle you and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to ostia from there caesar has decreed you be given an estate in paestum its beautiful an old greek town right on the ocean rich soil perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements although caesar will give you a sort of pension its always good to look to the future keep your hand in the arena so to speak was i so things change the government has moved to the circus youre going to fight last and commodus is going to fight first ill do it sure as theres shit in the tiber were all going to die but for you anything right right what am i thinking of right right but theyll have to bring in a lawyer i dont want to get sued over this fantastic wonderful but posters are very expensive i can really rape them on this can i at least tell them youll think about it a great deal they designed and build tigers chariot oh shit take your time dont get suckered this man is a murderer in his career hes killed over a thousand gladiators please just take the fall on you of course you are my bravest fighter the best fighter i have ever seen its absolutely not like that this is for your own good come on get the rest of your armor on but you have to go out there ill give you more than your one third when i get paid just take the fall youre too hurt to fight and the mans a killer the point is you get to fight the easy country circuit the small arenas relax live the good life you get to come alive again in the country you put this inside your shirt when tiger stabs your stomach its full of pigs blood gushes out everywhere its really impressive fantastic better than the real thing tigers challenged you and jerses has made me an offer made us both an offer you take a fall no more bad luck now the people are anticipating you i have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior the true roman the man who fought side by side with the wolf of rome it will be good luck for you to wear that helmet it belonged to cimon of smyrna he was crushed by an elephant dont be ridiculous general hang on drink slowly you are blessed by the gods to have a physician and a divine of janus with you tonight a fan sent them to you think about it just think about it at the end of the day i was approached by the golden pompeii olive oil company small but profitable they asked if you would endorse their oil we could get some very nice posters make some very big money thats one way to look at it general do you realize what happened out there today then youll die just know this because you asked i asked im sorry but legate narcissus meridas general of the spanish felix legions im proud to have you in my school now show them what you can do to fight well see sorry but i have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise i wont even get back the cost of the bribe i had to pay the arena slaves to get you here i know what youre trying to do kill yourself and trust in the roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands the only thing you have accomplishes is to prove youre a very important individual you make me feel good about my investment and that puking pig jerses he wont even discuss you both of you have clamped mouths but i love all my fighters ill find out about your family and about you that i promise chain him death is everything for me now you have to go to your cell and i to dicker with jerses youll be fed well i want you to be fit as you can be i want you to win for me tomorrow i want all my gladiators to win and be happy besides ive never owned a roman general before you are to be killed exactly theyll give you a sporting chance but just enough to make your murder entertaining romans like to mix their metaphors laughter with their executions you know if you survive though you will become a gladiator a gladiator at least gets a fair fight general all i know is you have been condemned to the colosseum and a trial is nowhere to be seen i am the man who might save your life give you a bit more life at any rate i am proximo palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me i own this school and everything thats in it youre in it but why what did a roman general do to get himself condemned to the colosseum understand we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets please i separated you from the others because my nose tells me youve been condemned for important reasons im a greek thank you and i was brought up believing romans were the barbarians give our new colleague some of the cretan white relax tell me everything im your friend youre a legate in the roman army huh and you act like one what was your crimethats what we want reaction and if lauras bourgeois lawyer friends cant take it then fuck em let em riot we can handle it well be ready i owe it to myself to go right

it never cost you a penny rob top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the 80s and 90s subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins is it better to burn out than to fade away well whats the point in that great thats the fun of working in a record store playing crappy pap you dont want to listen to i thought this tape was going to be

theres no the at the front of the title of the album isnt her album called number four with a smile bullshit no not nothing whats wrong with the righteous brothers what no the righteous brothers holy shiite what the fucks this just that rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business crippling nazi youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary thats all the malcolm mcclaren of clark street is in his executive suite do you have an appointment oh hi somebodys gon na die by blitz bella lugosis

really i mean i think about it but no i dont really think about it i dont want to dont need to i love you think about what i said i mean if you want to experiment or whatever are you still in love with me i think the big question here is where are you if you dont mind my saying so and i think i know where you are youre running on the run youre running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship and youre just going to hit it again with ian but its going to be with a world music bunny rabbitlooking earthshoewearing doctor whowatching twit who doesnt really understand you not the way that i do and will more in the future and youll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that youre in now only later and with him its me you do huh i dont have your number

have you slept with him yet great thats great fine im sure its in the file at home ill call you when i find it and then well talk ill look for em how you doing hi the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you havent done it was him yet but not even before when he was living upstairs never i dont know of course it is well sex i guess is sex with him better is it better you wont like it it sounds stupid no problem if i can ask one question yeah great well if you could tell me roughly it would help hey i just want to know where i stand what chance so we have a chance of getting back together again well if you dont know theres a chance right its like if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said i dont know if hes got a chance of survival or not then that doesnt mean the patients definitely going to die now does it it means he might live even if its only a remote possibility so what you havent definitely decide to dump me theres still a chance well get back together well then why dont you quit it while you seem to not be ahead why is that childish your living with the guy im just asking how its going no so is it working out with ian

need no i didnt have to you watch your mouth when youre in a goddamn county vehicle you dont think i see whats going on del now this cooley fella both of em mixed up with joyce s not no conspiracy not some episode off the xfiles s just a crime of passion plain and simple bettys on some kinda preminstral rampage thats what is going on here i know that she said she was in arizona did she why do i need to see this did he ask you to worry about your own goddamn lunch ah shit do i have to hear this now what the hell do you want hey sue ann whats up id like to apologize for our local boy hes been in love with betty since the fifth grade ysee he means well but hes in over his head on this i spoke to betty sizemore yesterday thats right theres no doubt in my mind folks shes on the run whether or not shes mixed up in all this remains to be seen no were bringing the community into the effort to find her thats right you have the right to remain silent you just dont know when to quit roy you were jealous of me when i got hall monitor in seventh grade and youre still jealous now thats it youre gone s just a theory just cause im thinking it dont mean i like it a woman can write a check so suppose betty found out about them junior year seems she was pretty familiar with ol del on a regular basis if you get my drift i questioned joyce about all this you just go write your little story roy ill handle the police work you bet i did i got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now they no longer live in tepees mr college graduate you think a woman did that im tellin you it wasnt no woman roy it wasnt a woman you need to get yourself gone from my crime scene and leave betty alone shes you are so goddamn weird oh and by the way get the hell outta here good god theyre meat eaters roy just drop the shit in there ahh whatd you do now fall off your bike again okay lets go i got nothing for the record yet mind your own business you just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer anyway plenty why you always got ta embarrass me i been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always got ta embarrass me and you should keep your nose out of another mans omelette its no big deal betty its fine mind your own meal why dont you go back to doing something youre good at like that lonelyhearts column ill take a refill there betty yeah it was great really put the whole idea of church bake sales in perspectivewesley didnt even want to come up here he warned me but i insisted i have to ask you bettyare you crazy so all this really was because of that soap opera my son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor a fake doctor did did you really come here because you love this guy when a roman general knew a battle was lost hed throw himself on his sword betty i dont wan na shrivel up alone in some stinking prison no way ive got some professional pride and i dont want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out ahh its too late anyway its too late listen i could shoot my way out maybe take one of them with me if youd gim me my gun back wait betty you still havent answered me if we went out that window right now wed have a chance youre sorry youre the reason were here thats my son my son is dead yes but id sort of like to put that behind me now i know i borrowed it from your grandparents because i i it doesnt matter dont worry theyre fine look i used to feel that same way said practically those same words sitting at night in a foxhole in korea ive chased you across the country betty and i come to find out were a lot more alike than youd think no one is honey here listen to this if who i am and who i hope to be should meet one day i know they will be friends now thats beautiful well thirtythree but im not counting del on account of you so what do you think you probably feel im flattering myself to see us together wait let me get this out i like the symphony walks in the rain sunsets animals and children i read passionately and i like to discuss things im basically conservative but flexible ive been involved in the death of thirty two people but i can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty two pieces of shit excuse my language im appreciably older than you but my health is good i take care of myself and i got some money socked away youd never have to work again thats for sure id treat you like a queen sure you could probably have any thing you wanted somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself and you dont even realize it i never meet people like you im a garbageman of the human condition i deal with trash mostly people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives but you youre different to see you damn life is strange i had you figured for this coldblooded calculating bitch not that i didnt admire you for it so you werent involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify were you mixed up in the drugs betty you really didnt have anything to do with what del was doing did you do you know why im here do you know who i am no just stand there lem me look at you a minute oh this is wonderful who are these idiots no that should be more than thanks so much you must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot how do you do mr mccord were trying to locate a deranged fan of yours a ms betty andersonville they did horrible things to men there did you know the most brutal inhumane prison of the entire war was in georgia even robert e lee was a loser jeb stuart stonewall jackson jefferson davis theyre all losers in my book you know its interesting the south lost the civil war but they still seem to get all the glory what part of dixie are you from duane and put them in your mouth well my idea of stupid is very different from yours so heres how this is gon na work would you take your socks off please lets see around here that would be kiowa kickapoo or osage if im not mistaken like what you did not just say injuns del hmmmm five stars huh is that stupid wesley i didnt think so so give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing not being stupid youre equipped to recognize it youre not a dumb fuck are you del im asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck could you give us an example what do you mean its a nice place you got here real comfortable sweet little town fair oaks you like it here we appreciate that but you just poured me a drink id like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes if were for real i like this i like doing business in the home its cozy whos birthday oh yes with the coffee youre a hundred percent right they rely on whatshisnames arm too much not her mouth ive spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me ive seen it painted on the horizon no i said to follow my instincts now we go up there and conclude our business case closed no if we dont finish this job how are we gon na look at ourselves in the mirror this is it for me wesley shes the last one my instinct says i got ta see this through with her and if theres one thing ive tried to teach you here we could do that i could be on my way to florida and you could go to thailand and fuck your brains out what do your instincts tell you to do now kid well you were right about what that bartender said you made your point i was wrong i said got it dont dont you talk about betty like that i dont care who she ends up being you never use that word again got it but shes no bettys smarter than that she wouldnt be here for a she cant be here because of a a soap opera not a soap opera thatd make her it just didnt fit her profile whos this wesley you need to remember who youre talking to cause i just dont buy it call it instinct call it 35 years of professional knowhow i never said that i believed what doesnt no no betty came here strictly for business cause its the biggest market for what shes selling i should have known it all along im kicking myself as i shave here so first thing we thats good youre learning but let me tell you why i know she was lying first off betty would never fall for a soap star its beneath her so you believed the bartender why this doesnt look like the kind of place betty would go to what where where is she every american should see the grand canyon are you an american when i grow up im going to become a nurse or a veterinarian i always want to help people and value all life be it animal plant or mineral does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you what difference does it make she wasnt in kansas city or houston or dallas we went to every goddamn place del mentioned and no betty so what the hell makes you think shes in vegas you think shes waiting for us with tassles on her titties vegas is too crass for betty one of the seven natural wonders of the world its a very moving experience trust me we should go not so fast slower blonde thin yes did they say she had style a kind of grace or anything howd they describe her i dunno something why is she doing this to me why that was a really shitty thing to do you dont look comfortable here thats cause you dont like being the center of attention do you nah youre like me well i should be in florida now if carl hadnt gone in to get those stones removed you wouldnt be here and id be on my way to the keys on my boat relaxing with a glass of port reti red do i deserve this in the twilight of my career do i deserve this i dont think so ive always tried to do whats right i never took out anybody who didnt have it coming im a professional and where the fuck am i im in purgatory and turn that fucking music off that woman could be in any one of four states four big states where the deer and the antelope play wesley were not in rhode island there it is again that lousy attitude that got us here in the first place that make a statement do an end zone dance shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude thats dragging this whole country down the drain they dont owe us shit wesley when you finish the job you get paid we havent finished the goddamn job what they said find it find her find it finish the job you were paid to do shes got class and poise lots of poise betty would never dress like that shes not some trailer park slut youre always so coarse do her right here lets just see what happens okay i wish that i could find a way to speak my thoughts on mothers day there are no words that quite express my gratitude or happiness a pleasant smile perhaps a kiss i would not fail to give her this id make her glad the whole day through by sayin mother i love you ps i wish i could say this to my mothers face but i cant anymore its not an exact science wesley he said theyll be here my houston contact has always been very reliable wise beyond her years im sure and such poise too very very impressive no like a worthy adversary wesley like a very worthy adversary oh for chrissakes it just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining then cut their mommas throat and go dancing the same night betty betty betty you should read more listen to me i think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this and we gave it to her she kept to herself for years living with a pompous asshole then she sees her opportunity and boom she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust these heartlanders cant figure it out cause thats not their sweet little betty hah weve been tracking her for what three days and i already understand her bettern most the people in that shitty little burg no i see betty as a midwestern stoic type ice water in her veins a clear thinker probably a swede or a finn id say that about torches her credibility wouldnt you joyce was screwing del so she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day i hope youre right maybe you dont appreciate the gravity of this situation its bad enough that we dont have what we came here for its worse that we dont know where it is and now this this was supposed to be my last job i already put the deposit down on my boat how can you eat at a time like this i get nauseous just watching you we dont but a 97 le sabrell be easy to find if its here town this size he said he gave his wife some car as a gift remember you have to rise above it the professionals rise above that kind of thing what the hell was that another statement wait any last words general lee hes telling the truth he doesnt know dels dead by the way i sent him to the great beyond im a yankee myself massachusetts mmmm well it was a piece of luck running into you duane i thought i was gon na have to take wesley out and hose him down all he talks about is those japanese gals fine ill get you a

him whine and you didnt take him out you scalped him christ i almost puked did i tell you that what look i saw his soul wesley he was face to face with his god and no one lies in that situation but your geronimo act rattled me and i abandoned my instincts never abandon you instincts i had to shoot him it was the only decent thing to do we dont know which buick do we this is great just great now we dont know where the goddamn stuff is that was to get him to talk get rid of that thing will you are you out of your mind you scalped him im all for them owning casinos getting rich off the white mans greed its a beautiful piece of irony isnt it wesley hold still del were just talking here then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut its amazing how easily the scalp comes off it wasnt always fatal wesley we could scalp del right now and hed be plenty alive to tell us how it feels you know a hundred and fifty years ago youd have been scalped for that remark about native americans right here where your house is youd have been scalped so you see we have totally different ideas of whats stupid and whats not dont we stupid is calling people in kansas city who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole and trying to sell it to them right wesley stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are by their very nature untrustworthy thats what i thought you better give me another example im just curious cant you give me an example wesley your wifes a very lovely woman have i seen her before bourbon little water thank you mrs blaine i can

than the occasional overexuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances that is a separate issue colonel imagine the utter chaos that would result from unled armies having at each other there must be gentlemen in command to lead and when appropriate restrain their men certainly you must know that in civilized warfare officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention apology accepted now on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements this is absolutely unacceptable thank you first you have in your possession certain belongings of mine including clothing private papers furniture and personal effects of a nonmilitary nature which i would like to have returned to me you are familiar with how these things are done in fact i would like to claim aggrieved status oh very well then would you as the initiating party like to begin oh let us unless you object i would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and as such there are certain customary practices perhaps i could explain them to you as you wish thank you colonel im afraid i dont know your name please forgive me for keeping you waiting my boys my boys you seem to have been well fed thank you for that colonel do you see that colonel civility is a secondary virtue it is superseded by duty how can we end this madness and if

expense of our cause when was that in the swamp at the expense of your men or when he killed thomas at the expense of your family fourteen dead eleven wounded eighteen captured were low on salt i should go to pembroke and get some father and the dogs too ill wager i didnt see any less than a mile fortyone wagons a company of redcoat infantry horses at the rear you know how old i am if youre

the continental army the best horseman the best shot the best scavenger and i know every deer path and swamp trail between here and charleston colonel i didnt request this transfer because youre my

dispatches to hillsboro have you seen any redcoats yes when i have children i hope i dont hide behind them father ive lost respect for you i thought you were a man of principle he vowed that if the assembly votes a single shilling to lee hell dissolve the body yes he seeks a levy of troops and money the british army is barricaded in boston harry lee is here from virginia recruiting for a

good stock on their mothers side they refused to give me their names their ranks are nine lieutenants five captains three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow their posts we picked them up hereandthere last night if thats your position then eighteen of your officers will die nineteen if you hang me with my men you have eighteen of my men i want them back prisoner exchange as long as your soldiers attack civilians i will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement and my men are excellent marksmen i consider them linked restrain them from the targeting of civilians including women and children and what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention that one is a bit more difficult please accept my apology for not having done so sooner i will do so as soon as possible very well proceed sir unless you would like to claim aggrieved status i served in his majestys army in the french and indian war im familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled shall we proceed colonel will do apology accepted my pleasure sir if this war is about more than thomas its about more than anne as well stay the course yes it was a different time son and youre a better man than that we took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort it was two weeks before they were all dead all except two we put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the french at fort ambercon the eyes fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the asheulot to the cherokee the french stayed east of the blue ridge after that and the cherokee broke their treaty with the french and stayed out of the fight that seemed to make a difference the war went another year things went better and men bought us drinks we buried them then we went to track it was a cold trail and they were moving fast we went faster we caught up to them at kentucky ford thats why it was four years between you and thomas it took me that long to regain her respect your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born i was drunk and i was foolish enough to answer her thats right and what do they know everyone knows its what made me a hero me harry lee all of us i got a medal men bought me drinks they still do sometimes everyone knows what happened you know what happened she is dont go in there dont go in there where its beautiful there your mother and i were there once before you were born granted where are you going what she said that oh my lord she said that i dont believe it and i wasnt there for it she spoke susan spoke you learned her lessons better than i stay the course your mother used to say that to me when id get drunk or lose my temper no i should have killed him when i had the chance gabriel are you asleep pride is his weakness lord cornwallis is brilliant his weakness is that he knows it these four wagons must be his flanking riders god help us all when youre forty

that why the assembly was convened what news anything about the convention in philadelphia the middle colonies thank you hows the spotted ones milk your son what did you name him i hope so and congratulations on the birth of your son goodbye harry it is ended two gabriel and thomas dont touch him his wife was killed yesterday she was with child how many men does cornwallis have under his command theyre nothing but farmers and youre asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard theyd be better off letting it move on you expect cornwallis to be held here by militia so youre going to try to keep cornwallis in the south until then long time when so now cornwallis will head north link up with clinton and finish off washington what are my orders whos in command where is he now we

woman that shell have her honeymoon under the stars dont depend on my decency im one of that sort for what reverend no he wont there are two things you need to know about cornwallis first he is a very proud man he would rather risk defeat than share a victory if you give him what he thinks is an out hell take it worse remember braddock i lost another a year ago thomas he was only fifteen gray put them away put those away god willing seventeen not yet thomas dont blame yourself you did what i told you to do quiet sixpounders lots of them thank you did you finish the upper fieldif youd grant me a final favor id like the chance to explain myself dont come back not tonight not again go back to your room quickly they incite us to act in ways we should not can not a lesson the marquis would do well to learn madeleine i there are certain things feelings we must not voice by whom the marquis turn you out charenton has changed its not safe for you here is that a promise you can truly keep the doctors a respected man a friend of the court in part yes why not act the role of heroines instead queen esther from the bible or st joan but why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence but why must you indulge in his pornography had i known your taste in novels i never wouldve taught you to read not now or were both done for has he hurt you the next time you feel the urge to visit the marquis i hope youll come to confession instead madeleine we cant all we can do is guard against our own corruption youd deny a dying man his salvation i must grant him his last rites free his mouth you neednt worry valcour its administrative nothing more of course im here tomorrow well cut out your tongue we inspected the body marquis she died a virgin then it mustve been love was it impotence why was it you never took her by force youre no stranger to rape marquis and yet with her you cooed you courted you begged and did you i know because i felt it myself the passion in your heart i saw the longing in your eye its no secret that you loved her an innocent child is dead your words drove bouchon to your wig remove your wig now strip i do not mean to flirt marquis off with your clothes you expect me to pimp madeleine what on earth would that require what in gods name am i to do with you the more i forbid the more youre provoked if it were up to the doctor youd be flayed alive its horrors perhaps its darkest nightmares and to what end nothing but your own morbid gratification because your writing continues unchecked and your meat shall be deboned orvolle his wine from now on nothing but water at every meal valcour his chair his rug good day marquis thats enough i dont know who you insult more her or me you always do whores and pederasts youre better off without them you know what sacrilege is dont you the last refuge of the failed provocateur start with the bible its cheerier and more artfully written try reading for a change the writer who produces more than he reads the sure mark of an amateur perhaps in time youll earn them back through good behavior if you wont be true to your word then youve left me no choice how can one man possibly be so selfish you mean to take us all down with you if you only mean to dupe me again do i have your word you among them put yourself in my place ive your fellow patients to consider if charenton falls theyve no place to go no manner in which to clothe or feed themselves our future lies in the stroke of your pen more than your writings at stake the ministry has threatened us with closure one more trick like this and ill be forced to revoke all your liberties but isnt that the duty of art to elevate us above the beast but we also fall in love we build cities we compose symphonies and we endure why not put that in your books as well and such puny scope nothing but the very worst in mans nature its not even a proper novel its nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions frankly it even fails as an exercise in craft the characters are wooden the dialogue is inane not to mention the endless repetition of words like nipple and pikestaff enough to discern its tenor but youve no right to publish behind my back without my sanction what did you do bribe one of the guards take your pen in hand marquis purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper maybe theyll govern you less in life im not a beautiful young prospect ripe for corruption in exchange we ask only that you follow the rules now you know as well as i do youre not to entertain visitors in your quarters we treat you well enough here dont we marquis your very own featherbed in lieu of a straw mat your antique writing desk all the way from lacoste enough quills to feather an ostrich its not even noon ive stared into the face of evil and ive lived to tell the tale now for your own sake let me write it down no sir plainly put i never expect to sleep again im not the first man god has asked to shed blood in his name i will not be the last poorly and my own i beg you doctor dont make me say it as you say doctor if only blood will appease you then shed mine madeleines not wicked its the marquis whos corrupted her thats not her fault its mine its a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children youll get more from her with kindness than you will with force ill do everything in my power thats not our intent it was not inspired by circumstance it was fiction of course madame bougival mademoiselle clairwil and of course the marquis wife i have hes more than a patient doctor the marquis is my friend hes sworn to obedience i spoke to him with reason and compassion the tools which serve us best here charenton is my lifes work to have her wrested from beneath me now on the contrary let me take up this matter with the marquis myself a practical man sir given the marquis unusual tastes a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent why so hell learn to fear punishment rather than pursue virtue for its own reward but hes one among some two hundred wards shut down yes ive taken vows to live my life within these walls not outside them you have to believe me i had no idea for sale to the general public certainly not its unprintable its essential to his recovery a purgative for the toxins in his mind oh that he no longer roars or spits he no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards besides every wholesome thing he might desire he has at charenton a library filled with the worlds great books music lessons watercolor exercises a man of his notoriety he wouldnt last a day on the streets without capture better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one his wifes influence hes made a great success of our little theater theres seldom an empty seat not to mention its therapeutic value i hope youll judge him by his progress here and not his past reputation a few indiscretions in his youth if you dont mind my asking why has the emperor taken such sudden interest in my our affairs youre a man of science im a man of god charenton stands to profit from us both im certain of course dr royercollard may i be the first to welcome you to charenton weve still a few lone incurables prone to violence to perversion of course everythings not as harmonious as it seems i hope youve a strong constitution ever since his unfortunate death theres been a surge of interest in his work ill use the profits to restore charenton to her former glory theyve the satisfaction only a hard days labor can provide and the listless ones do the binding im afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance were the laughing stock of all france but on a happier note welcome to charenton abbe du maupas gibberish my friend he rants and he raves will you sleep soundly tonight and you it mustve been an ordeal how is the patient faring my my you have exceeded my expectations her name abbe perhaps youll be so kind as to remind me of her name he was so impressed with the marquis tale that he chose to reenact it yes youd suffer in her stead this child let loose the beast from its cage hell do no such thing what could cause a tincture like this do more otherwise ill be forced to report to the ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers charenton is a sanatorium she is not a circus the theater is henceforth closed as for your avowed friend playwright emeritus of the madhouse you ought to be ashamed abbe exploiting those drooling pathetic cretins for financial gain no it most certainly was not of course oh indeed then ive friends of my own to visit you keep strange company abbe but if you truly have matters in hand here and well and place my reputation at stake you find this amusing do you youre a sentimental man have you tried bleeding him with leeches the calming chair maybe you should flog him at the stake in their eyes the marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here unless we set charenton on a straight and narrow course shell be shut down forever by order of the emperor abbe i admire you i do youve a conviction an idealism peculiar to the very young and so ill be candid the ministry has sent me here with the most explicit the most severe instructions all france is aghast at this book yet youve not heard of it do you favor its publication well and his writing what is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche and hes never once attempted escape his wifes why is he in your care and not a proper prison playing dressup with cretins that sounds like a symptom of madness not its cure indiscretions abbe please ive read his case history at sixteen he violated a serving girl with a crucifix after six months in the dungeon at vincennes he mutilated a prostitute cutting her flesh with a razor then cauterizing the wounds with wax i understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction it seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy ill need an office on the grounds someplace to store my things its a formality truly this may feel a tad awkward my friend but it neednt be ive merely come to oversee your work here understood i dont shed tears over the past monsieur delbenï½ i look to the future do you know how i define idealism monsieur delbenï½ charenton the administrator there is quite wellloved is he not i dont seek popularity or renown monsieur delbenï½ mine is a higher mission but here at the hotel dieu we favor an aggressive course of treatment its libelous you wouldnt dare youve no right to assault me in this fashion ill call for my footman ill have you removed i can say with the utmost sincerity that every franc youve given me has been put to sterling use this is neither the time nor the place good god marquise of course and i in yours now is the time to secure your epitaph the benevolent marquise charentons most revered philanthropist or satans bride words alone are insufficient if youre truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husbands celebrity that illgotten funds borne of his degeneracy might now effect his salvation what a beautiful thought marquise but youve a pension havent you from the sale of his books perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them that barely covers the cost of his room theres nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments opiates to quell his temper restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves youre aware are you not that it costs a great deal to house your husband at charenton i assume youve come to plead for clemency on your husbands behalf with all due respect madame all france is familiar with your husband grant us a moment alone wont you monsieur prouix i pray you be succinct my schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics it is customary to write first and request an appointment you prefer a book to your husbands company id prefer to have our brandy in the salon there we

you he didnt kill her someone else did it your father gave them to both of you that locket youre holding you have one just like it i was a friend of your sistersyeah smoke because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else so now youve got to talk him out of it and then weve got to figure out an acceptable political solution jesus mary and joseph i told you how stupid it was to float the lippman article but you wouldnt listen to me what if there hasnt been a coup at all what if its you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade and jack wants to trade the missiles in turkey what does the letter say helen and i went out for breakfast excoms not supposed to convene til eight adlai can handle zorin he knows the inning and the score im just trying to make a point this idea is that fucking bad something your father wouldve come up with then talk to your brother goddamn it the two of you dont need any advice to get into trouble you cant take him out this late in the game we cant do that bobby jesus give it a rest you were thinking the same thing just didnt have the guts to take the heat hes right and things are happening too fast it smells like the bay of pigs all over again its too politicized with you in there anyway they need to be able to stick their necks out theyre going to be pressing for a military solution soon we cant afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats we need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here the other thing is who gives a shit about the midterms now the soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us every day the sun comes up says something about us it shouldnt have but it did the sun came up today you listen to me nobody nobody talks about my friends that way youre fucking here right now because of the kennedys they may be wrong they make mistakes but theyre not weak the weak ones are these people who cant speak their own minds yes it is then they should speak up i think its a bad idea helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families whats it about hey mac youre up bright and early no im glad im home we got a back channel communication from khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal he confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the president i think weve won ill be evacuated with the president nothing nothing you dont know about tomorrows the big day just have the car ready to go if i call or if the civil defense warning comes on i dont know helen i want you to keep the kids close tomorrow leave the tv on sleep with it on in the bedroom until i tell you you can turn it off kids are supposed to get detention well you know how bobby has it in for the state of mississippi why dont you ask him yourself you can have him on the way home he was tell you what were in connecticut tomorrow for ribicoff ill get you up front with him during the flight forget it scotty well there is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about i said his heart not his attention busy but youve got his heart back to work get back out there kid remember to hit em hard i uh hey sport you winning wrong and you get to wax my car secretary of defense and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it dont take it to court but weve got good circumstantial evidence walter agrees my guts telling me khruschevs turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message they know each other khruschev and feklisov aka fomin were war buddies hello zorin must not have gotten instructions somebody in their foreign ministrys blown it bigtime yeah a good political solution then somebodyd better deny it publicly if we made a trade wed be giving in to extortion and nato would never trust us again well get clobbered in world opinion oh just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our jupiter missiles in turkey if the sovietsll do the same in cuba and we cant purge the chiefs our invasion talk will look like a bluff or even that theres been an attempted coup have to hope its a signal that hell back down on the real issue too thats going to be tough you know how these guys are about their chains of command maybe its harder for them to say it than they let on at the very least they believe its in our best interest and at the end of the day they may end up being right im your political advisor and im giving you political analysis here this is a setup the chiefs want to go in its the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs they have to go in and they have to do it right its that simple fair enough but castros on alert and were flying attack planes over their sites on the deck theres no way for them to know theyre carrying cameras not bombs theyre going to be shot at plain and simple what about these lowlevel flights theyre starting in what an hour do you realize what youre letting yourself in for all right cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships shots being fired across bows i dont like whats happening youd worry that something was wrong if congress offered you unconditional support we have to try the blockades it probably wont work it may just be delaying the inevitable but we cant just go to war without trying not to damn right im scared im not calling and canceling on daly you call and cancel on daly no way you dont show for chicago everyonell know theres something going on cheer up youve neutralized the entire white house press corps for a day there is no expert on this subject no wise old man call me irish but i dont believe in cooler heads prevailing then we need to do a few things right away no pierre he knows the press knows youre going to have to keep up your schedule your movements are followed too closely and we need to get these guys out of the white house george balls got a conference room at state reconvene over there this afternoon come back here tonight thereve got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them should be here any minute not as far as the election goes today for your information is pulaski day were going to buffalo no you werent and if this is a move to appease the hard line then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house you were in the room it was your purview it was your job to make sure bissel wasnt fucking us over and you didnt do it youve got the most important job in the world right now youre the smartest guy the president has besides me listen to me goddamn it were talking about a possible nuclear war you dropped the ball on bay of pigs moving the line stroke of genius six months from now im not going to care are you well deal with it jesus christ that may be why khruschevs introducing this guy weve been burned by his usual players in the formal channels so he brings in an honest broker dangle a settlement tie us down in negotiations we come up shortdoesnt matter to me if i went down in history like adams id die happy all they say about him today is yeah but the country didnt even exist as a country yet it was a mess and he didnt have a leg to stand on we were just debating who had it worse us or george washington and his guys thats all well and good but what do we say to em mcnamaras on his way back here now we need to pick the right ship no subs no armed boarding parties either we need a little more time to figure this one out weve got bigger problems right now somebody had to say it i respect adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser well im not i want a consensus bobby consensus either air strike or blockade something everyonell stand by even if they dont like it i need it by saturday make it happen lying bastard lied to my face we keep em in the dark as long as we can but i sure as hell am going to test him tonight listening to taylor and acheson i kept seeing burke and dulles telling me all i had to do was sign on the dotted line the invasion would succeed castro would be gone just like that easy we cant worry about everything right now weve got to figure out what were going to do before we worry about how we do it so if there are alternatives that make sense and im not saying there are we need em need em fast did you have any indication of this from georgi any possible warning or sense of motivation good does this attack on our plane represent a definitive intentional escalation on the part of the soviets then we have no choice general issue the warning orders to our forces they will be prepared to execute the air strikes monday morning and the followon invasion according to the schedule thereafter ill need the official release orders on my desk sunday night so which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world how do we work with them if theres been a hardline coup general the joint chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the soviets you have signaled an escalation which i had no wish to signal and which i did not approve i have the authority i am the commanderinchief of the united states and i say when we go to war all right then i guess its time guess we cant blame khruschev for a few patriotic farmers and the ships how long until the army is ready is this the chiefs recommendation an invasion max we give them something we tell them well remove the missiles from turkey say six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage we also tell them if they go public about it we deny it and the deal is off okay ken were going youre sure ive got to move what do you have kenny didnt know adlai had it in him too bad he didnt have this stuff in 52 jesus christ odonnell youre the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution its a goddman trial balloon trial is the operative word here i dont want to listen to this again whats that hes right we cant rescind defcon 2 the soviets will think weve gotten sweet on them we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships but it doesnt get us any closer to removing those missiles any problems you remind them those chains of commands end at one place me how does a man get to a place where he can say throw those lives away so easily im gon na protect those pilots we need those flights we have to know when those missiles become operational because when they do we need to destroy them i know i know in the morning im taking charge of the blockade from the situation room mcnamarall set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon keep an eye on things there they want this fucking job they can have it its no great joy to me i dont know i dont know youre scared to cancel on daly i dont care cancel it have you canceled chicago and the rest of the weekend yet lets get out of here achesons scenario is unacceptable and he has more experience than anyone okay kenny and i only show for the meetings you call us into impress us and do it fast youre in charge of keeping this quiet if word gets out before we know what were going to do therell be panic and itll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them no choice this is going to cost lives any way we go do nothing and it could be 80 million of ours we have to get rid of those missiles good still think cuba isnt important so whatve we got today i was you bastard i was eating that will somebody find out whats going on captain belay that order bob wheres that coming from captain force the sub to the surface for inspection bob is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first bob bob bet you had a late nightwhat he means is its difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes it lives in the mind excuse me did you or did you not have a gun to his head thats pretty simplistic dont you think youre welcome ah right well i gave you my opinion hes right you look horrible so i hear hhhuh so we decoy her stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she wont know the difference hes great come on lets blow before lo gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast i like what youve done with it whens captain nemo moving in were springing you leer get some pants on hes fine hes narrating oh dont be silly no one your age just wants to go home besides faculty will be present just think of it as a field trip fascinating listen why dont you come out with us after the lecture theres a place on the hill i always get trip to take me i peeked me what can i do thats very enlightened professor its comforting to know that americas children have you for a teacher do you know he wont expel him ah well congratulations meanwhile what is james supposed to do pray for walter gaskell to come to his the jacket tripp we need the jacket in a sense bad examples look tripp i dont want to depreciate the loss here but perhaps in a sense this is for the best or hemingway when hadley lost all those stories youll be all right then look at carlyle when he lost his luggage naturally you have copies christ tripp how did you know theres only one problem tripp we dont know his real name we just made it up in fact we made the whole guy up uh huh so we find vernon we find the car we find the car such as the hood jumper so whose car is it let me get this straight jerry nathan owes you money so as collateral he gives you his car want some help with that it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas oh huh exactly how do we do that so what do we do now i want to publish this ive got to i think theyll let me with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant the chancellors here now so whats the problem im afraid hes pretty worn out poor kid yees the truth i know thats always been real important to you okay check this out oh come on tripp cut the kid some slack so modest hey i heard all about it the parents the grandparents the china town thing and i believe you okay thats why were here now go get dressed jesus there must be two dozen windows on that thing how are we supposed to find his plenty im sure but for what its worth so tell me about you and the chancellor competence bad enough and god knows i dont exactly fit the new corporate profile ive been doing this a long time tripp i feel this kid in my bones you know based on what ive read this is a very exciting piece of material this big parade is it a little late to call the chancellor ah wait a minute the university must know where he lives good god lets go rescue him kidnapped by who james my james whats happened sometimes we have to improvise honestly tripp do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you what ohhhh is that it tripp where the hell tripp where would we go back up go out the other way just go around him hit your brakes tripp that was good because because and he had a younger brother who was a he cant piss standing up anymore vernon then vernon hardapple the scars are from a from a horse he fell during a race and got trampled huh uh a jockey his names um curtis curtis hardapple no sexual confusion there eh professor on the contrary it could be just the ticket he is take my word for it well im going to read it anyway so is he any good he finished it winter break he has a book sara and walter declined guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog primarily although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia you missed a few bottles by the way oh im sure youll find another you always do i thought you were mrs gaskells hobby tripp but why didnt you say something tripp i mean what are we doing here left you who emily trip yeah between a bookie and a pair of broken legs he owes god money you know he queered himself for good with esquire you didnt actually purchase this car did you trip forget i asked i dont want to pressure you tripp but i get pressure know what i mean i thought you were tinkering great i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend think that might be possible mm youre stoned if it can produce a miss sloviak youll get no argument from me do you know how many times ive boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me particularly while im on my way to pittsburgh perfect well then shall we your wife i was explaining to antonia how a book comes to be published what you do as a writer what i do as an editor brimming say hello to my new friend miss antonia uh trippyou peeked didnt you gee i dont know crabs improvise youre good at that no but i dont think that matters walter gaskell isnt going to send james leer to jail crabs i know that came to my senses oh right oola about that jacket i dont think so in my experience signs are usually a lot more subtle kind of a sign youre saying he was never able to reproduce them that was maccaulay i have an alternate version of the first chapter call it a hunch no wonder he screwed us over we find the jacket thats my car motherfucker he said a few things that lead me to believe the cars his my guess vernon hardapple only now im starting to think the car wasnt exactly jerrys to give dont touch it first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car find the jacket great between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet its been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail evidently coming who do you think it is there is no problem did i say there was a problem shut up james nevertheless theres a police officer standing on the porch and i dont think hes going away is he awake crabtree its just ail that crap he spins out just once id like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth so sensitive oh christ dont start on ol gran or well leave you here i told you they keep him chained in the basement come on whats to tell which is how bad is it for you only in your bones love its love parade and what do you mean based on what youve read you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines maybe i dont know its a little late to call admissions good idea crabs only one problem i dont know where they live his parents nothing hes just been sort of i dont know kidnapped think hannah does james have any friends i mean besides you and me gee i dont know crabs i dont seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room you stay there listen hannah im flattered really but right now i shit wait here ill be right back shit whats this guys problem yes christ crabs what do you expect me to do the kids practically in a coma he heard everything we were saying groom named claudell and his mother blames vernon for his death he lives with his mother and now hes addicted to painkillers not curtis hes a boxer a flyweight shut up and drink i think its more complicated than that besides hes a little scattered he almost did something stupid tonight at least i think so anyway he doesnt need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now come on crabs dont do this hes one of my students for christ sake im not even sure if hes no not yet he isnt i know he started it fall semester im sure where is everyone is that just beer piss off crabs i lost a wife today this morning i found a note in the kitchen she left me crabs he said something about being between things it was jerry nathans he owed me money i just mean i dont know im sort of at a critical juncture its fine its done basically im just sort of tinkering with it isnt she shes still a transvestite shes a transvestite lay off pittsburgh its one of the great cities oh were picking her up downtown emily i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling how are you crabtree hey jeff if youre really interested in discussing that business with the tango try the guy at the end

im in kinship listen sara theres some things we need to talk about sara hi its grady could you hold on a minute honey hello yes james well lets see if we can keep that from happening im a little worried james dont worry james ill figure something out its walters dog and yes she does know but lets spare her the details come on your shoes are in the hail and we both thank you for that but were were fine ah wear whatever you want in the crawl space with the rats and the casks of amontillado come on up get out of here near carvel i remember that five or six years ago james like it or not theyre your parents james listen things things are a little weird with me right now and i well i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you and if you hang around me long enough something bad is going to happen trust me thats why i need you to go home understand nowhere you just sit here and eat you just worry about yourself james okay when nobodys looking i eat i dont know episodes spells jesus james you make it sound like were in a tennessee williams play i dont have spells no thanks in a minute get us a table let me spell it out for you james books dont mean anything not to anybody not anymore and dont be so goddamn sensitive who cares what anybody thinks anyway you want to be a good writer you want to be a great writer then stop giving a damn what other people think most of them havent thought in years who cares what i said last night james i i was drunk i was stoned id been bitten by a dog my wife had left me how bout cutting me some slack shut up james youre annoying carrie and howard dont know what the fuck theyre talking about okay the entire class combined including the lovely hannah green has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have okay i didnt mean it that way i never said that the hell i am not you your talent because you act like a goddamn spook all the time not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you thats why they all give you such a hard time in workshop james fall semester first day of class it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat i dont know james i dont know why i do half the things i do who does why do you wear that coat thanks for the halo james but ive never done that much thinking ahead in my life ever okay james i wish you hadnt shot my girlfriends dog even though poe and i werent exactly what youd call simpatico thats no reason for him to take two in the chest still the fact remains that im the one who took you up into the chancellors bedroom im the one who has to take the blame i dont know what the hell i was thinking it wasnt her dog its her husbands who said anything about girlfriend what jesus look james you appear to possess like many an aspiring writer before you by the way a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made however i think its best if for the moment at least we abstain i just wanted a little sip tell me james exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy i know its the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning make yourself at home ill be right back oh right well lets try not to think about that relax emily hasnt carried a house key since she was twelve years old and your hips are as slim as hers she came here well just wait in the meantime i need you to shimmy through smoke the rest of that joint james and you can start on the box how can you tell thats right that one unless i miss my bet my wife kinship i thought you were the guy who didnt like to lose control of his emotions amazing didnt you say your mom went to catholic school james leer are you telling me your mother was a stripper what kind of dancer your father worked in a mannequin factory i never heard of it carvel wheres carvel wheres that jesus james wow glaucoma maybe your aunt dont be proud james were in sewickley heights we could find you a nice golf course to barf on yeah well actually shit james youre hungover what do you thinks the matter with you hm i dont know me jesus james you shouldve told someone but james i mean how long so where have you been staying i guess theres probably a story behind that well done james well james you did shoot the head of the english departments dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia no one seems to know where you live james hannah thought youd like my couch hm ah i dont believe in writers block washed up but i think its sort of writing itself at this point afraid so good james if the zodiac killer calls be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right whatd you tell him whatd he say who sure there is but its not that interesting huh oh no this isnt emilys i just write in it oh im okay i just lost my balance youre welcome shit he mustve left it back at thaw in the auditorium whats he saying is he all right right thats why you were standing in the chancellors back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight youre fine all right youre fit as a fucking fiddle looks like our old friend mr codeine that should take the pinch out of my ankle have one most of the time he is james some of the time he isnt now what do we have here she is ah here we go miss sloviaks thats just what they used to say in the ads come on crabtree i know youre holding ive got tenure trust me james when the family pets been assassinated the owner doesnt want to hear one of her students was the triggerman i dont know im still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husbands dog yea james hes dead james believe me i know a dead dog when i see one okay okay take it easy dont freak out on me couldnt youve just pulled him off me shit james you shot dr gaskells dog yes well its complicated james i think we should go now maybe im feeling a little sad myself tonight right pretty good im friends with dr gaskell too i guess walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things like the lady herself really go ahead so im told thats really it this is worth it james dont leave just yet theres something i think you ought to see heaven youre right so what are you doing out here you cold james really thats remarkable well listen james about this afternoon in workshop im sorry i think i let things get a bit out of control sounds like a good one she went crazy frances farmer youre not like my other students james so what was the movie you two saw maybe its because shes beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up its inevitable that it will in some way relax james im not her father i just rent her a room are you and hannah seeing each other james you carry firearms its very convincing uh huh well thanks for the thought but as shocking as this may sound im not the first writer to sip a little weed and furthermore it might interest you to know that one book i wrote as you say under the influence happened to win a little something called the pen award which by the way i accepted under the influence that good huh right anyway i was wondering if i could borrow your car mines sort of out of commission he cribbed that from borges but where i need the street the aunt hannah where did you take james that day crabtree he doesnt even know james jesus actually hes not the chancellors what listen hannah you dont remember where that aunt worked do you james aunt no its okay i just cant believe i left it out in the open like that crabtree hasnt been in here has he poking around hey oh well i i dont think it really matters hannah we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point all right take him to my place he can crash on the sofa hhuh last time i saw it was that strikes me as odd hannah are you telling me you dont know where james leer lives look hannah when you get him home make sure hes all right before you leave okay do i hope that isnt true we need all the downy innocents we can get i thank you james this is my editor terry crabtree the answers yes i think yes i dont know where are they exactly hes going with me you take crabtree and his friend all right me sure why thanks for that he all right yes hannah you dont deserve me you know in the hospital i was kind of excited about it at the time but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers does he still love you did you tell walter i guess you have to go on faith i went and looked at some babies just now ouch how many i know i lost it all im through improvising im so glad to see you sara and what did you say he told you i think i mightve said i was in love with you i think i might have would walter really press charges of course im sure ah christ the puberty police are

chancellor thats nice all we have is a japanese beetle trap jesus is that what he told you hed call it habit but now i get the feeling hes going through the motions a bit like most editors he really wants to be a writer but hes too busy living a novel to bother writing one hes writing his name in water tony im sorry if things didnt work out so well for you tonight with terry listen antonia im not sure thats possible james is i dont know im your man hes still barking at me hes blind its mrs gaskells her hobby lucky guess that perfume youre wearing antonia it wouldnt happen to be cristaile would

thinking ive got to find a way to distract this kid so you did it was in its way a noble act youre mad because i shot your girlfriends dog youre mad at me arent you probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night i just wanted a little sip it feels really good here its not that it just reminded me of you know of whats in the car in the trunk maybe she didnt come here want one

thanks ill keep it in mind wait a minute i thought we were negotiating here youre kidding right look at these readings for christs sake pges own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells on numerous occasions what about in terms of medical expenses 250000 doesnt come close to what this familys gon na have to spend on doctors 250000 all of them fax these to this number okay whats she doing here i didnt mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor jesus look at me what do i have this afternoon what the hell is this doing here you shouldnt judge brenda whoa remind me carlos isnt a friend hes a client what do you think whats this oh jesus whos responsible for his pain and suffering this time the firm took in sixty thats three percent seemed like a fair bonus to me take it okay fine fine you backed me into a corner again youre holding me hostage i can always find someplace else to work someplace thatll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the french riviera the extortion the threats oh okay here it comes you see your office cause you got a little voice in your head saying do the right thing give him another chance but i know youre not gon na quit on me the luckiest son of a bitch in the universe erin the luckiest son of a bitch in history i did both i was wrong i dont know what to say ho ly shit erin what are you erin because kurt doesnt want to work with you he thinks youre a loose cannon this isnt doctors orders its mine im saying you cant come youre not gon na be there tuesday at seven at the hinkley firehouse i know were having a meeting its all set up hey thats not so bad compare it to the love canal that was twenty years ago and those people still havent seen a dime so in legal terms ten years is five years maybe for a trial double that for the appeal because they know the evidence they know theyre gon na lose a jury trial maybe they wouldnt lose 400 million bucks but once you factor in all theyd spend on this case in the next ten years it makes a lot of with nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet id say well end up on the lower end of that still a lot of money uhhuh im not gon na fire you i wanted to but then you got sick and that woulda made me look like a shit you embarrassed me erin dont give me that youve gotten plenty youve been wellpaid youve gotten lots of perks no ones taking anything okay now youre making this personal and it isnt youre emotional youre erratic you say any god damn thing that comes into your head and im not saying thats bad that can be great that can be a lot of fun look this is serious now theyre talking serious money okay look its an important meeting kurt thought if it was just lawyers look you said you werent feeling great i thought you should rest erin its just a meeting gee i wonder why because thats how people treat each other bullshit it was a misunderstanding but instead of handling it politely instead of treating her with respect hes got a reputation for doing all his reasons pge thinks it shouldnt go to its pge saying to the judge that we dont have a case their lawyers go dont joke they might so do me a favor and behave yourself for once ed masry to see kurt potter its eight million dollars erin eight million dollars maybe but maybe not we still dont have anything linking this to pge corporate plus theres the statute problem plus were way short on manpower so wed need to bring on more lawyers and its less than pocket change for pge im thinking i wish someone else had to make this decision 50 thousand bucks is more than any other california toxic plaintiff has gotten ever but its about 50 thousand per plaintiff things like the head counsel for pge calling me with an offer 20 million plus attorneys fees take it or leave it ill see what i can do is that what you want erin youre a big girl if you got a problem with jane work it out for yourself i dont have time to deal with oh jesus you wan na tell me what the problem is here or im sorry im gon na have to put you on hold for just one second here do you mind i was just asking are you all right hes gone did you get a license plate or a make what kind of truck what who he said hed be at the gas station at six hey a new plaintiff called wants to meet you i told him wed be out there thursday theyre trying to intimidate us tell them to wait in the conference room from their tone of voice on the phone id say theyre taking us more seriously hey i like working with you i would now me too thats why i like it its been a long time since i had a case i cared about i like this case then they didnt know and if they didnt know we cant hit em for punitive damages and punitive damages is where the money is show me the document that proves that pge corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley weve got the pge fuckers in hinkley by the balls but nobodys getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate pge fuckers in san francisco hey i got a staff to pay plus rent plus i havent billed a minute of my time since i started on this case so you can quit hitting me up like im rich or something erin lem me tell you something if ida put three researchers on this i wouldnt expect them to dig up all the information you got here this is some damn good work no shit jesus i dont even wan na ask what you did to make this melendez guy talk they skipped that step and thats what caused the contamination i dont remember seeing any ponds up there you wan na talk about is that what i think it is what now yeah yeah remind me of that when im filing for bankruptcy kinda like david and whatshisnames whole fucking family okay heres the deal if and only if you find me the evidence to back all this up ill do it ill take it on this is a whole different ball game erin a much bigger deal you think theres more how many families we talking about here oh you do with all your legal expertise you believe that i know how dna works erin its about being realistic something like this erin it could take forever theyre a huge corporation theyd completely bury us in paperwork im just one guy with a shitty little pi firm its not about working hard because i said no look the only reason pges even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute we add plaintiffs and suddenly were in the middle of a toxic tort with a statute problem against a massive utility no thank you hunhuh absolutely not then i dont get anything either erin erin yeah isnt that a shame what you think im made of money because they can you heard that kid they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal they can afford to waste all the time in the world that wasnt an offer a million wouldve been an offer when they send the god damn mail clerk down to jerk me off waste my time its a fuck you it sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice im telling you the minute brenda sent the fax im talking the second she pressed that send button pge claims department is on the phone to me scheduling a meeting find out this is the only thing you found a ten percent raise and benefits but thats it im drawing the line okay a 5 raise and look erin this is not the way i do business this extortion nonsense lem me see it will you that document you found the one that says it was the bad chromium you didnt happen to make a copy did you i didnt see any medical records in there what medical records so what made you think it was but pge told her about the chromium so whats the story on this thing this cancer stuff i dont know maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun look im sorry you were gone i just assumed you were off having fun he wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium is 05 parts per million and that at the rate you mentioned 58 it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about the irvings i got an interesting call this afternoon it was from a dr frankel come on im trying to help here okay enough now look erin this incident aside i dont think this is the right place for you so what im gon na do is make a few calls on your behalf find you something else okay thats not how we work here you dont just leave a message and take off erin youve been gone for a week how come youre not at lunch with the girls youre a girl youre a girl good you do know how to do that dont you oh huh well look i got this file i need valued real estate thing a lady has some property next to a pge plant that pge wants to buy i need to know what to ask for it wheres

can do it the way everyone else does send in a rï½sumï½ make an im sorry about that really but i never lied i may have miscalculated that happens sometimes but you did wow sorry about that listen marios a little not so bright he seems to think that you said im sorry erin okay lets try and settle down here i told you the questions might get a little personal if you hadnt used profanity yeah i know right corey sixtynine weve got good answers to all of em yesterday or lem me guess toxic waste how does someone get meningitis jesus meningitis what the hell is meningitis promise youll turn

boyfriend cause there may be men who dont mind being the maid and getting nothing in return but im sure as shit not one of em its a pair of earrings i saw em in the mall one day and i thought damn those would look good on those beautiful earlobes so i bought em and i said to myself next time erin says something nice does something nice ill surprise her with em know how long ago that was six months in six months you havent said one nice thing to me thats a long time about this thinking bull shit erin bullshit fuck you just cause i dont spend all day trying to prove what hot shit i am it

company account we did one point seven million in total revenue uhwe actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service thatï½s right and auto supply i was a sales associate at

mean i dont have anything on me this wont be safe most kids do i guess no but it might as well be the same thing this was a message from someone or something hinting at the design im not just layin down a bunch of math here with this im talking about indications omens that day that we were meant to die that if we have been aware of would have saved everyone on the plane right april 25th remember the departure time thirtynine remember the gate number how many died on flight 180 from our group he said death has a design even before he said that i had been seeing patterns ahhh fuck you fucking asshole you think this is funny you fucking dick tod if youre not dead im gon na fucking kill you thats him but hes not here that him this place i dont know i wish i could just see him one more time then maybe i would know what if tod is just the first of us ive never dealt with death before i wasnt alive when my grandparents died i wish i could know i mean all this could just be in our heads now it feels like its everywhere im really sorry you went there ive wanted to go there but i thought it was off limits its only the end of june how would i know you think im some sort of of course not gods arent afraid to die gods dont die we do my intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design but i saved him i intervened just like the plane thats the design you should have been next after lewton you shouldve been next thats the only pattern you should be dead no it doesnt matter whos next were all on the same list is knowing going to make it easier it makes it harder why do you think i was hiding look theres something you should all know i dont i wish you were on the plane fuck you ill remove myself thats a plan and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded the the whole plane blew up it was so real exactly how everything goes cmon man like you really thought you were gon na tittie fuck em over greenland or something man that is one george michael notch from being gay no i cant as long as im in here its outta my control yes see theres this pattern thats occuring i believe that ms lewtons next no i saw it i saw it i got this feeling a weird feeling i cant explain it im sorry we broke in design you saying tod did kill himself his fathers pretty fucked up with denial maybe he couldnt deal with the thought of an other accident taking another son why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide im a friend of his his best friend see his fatherno harm no foul you may not realize it but were all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail every single move we make from the mundane to the monumental the red light we stop at or run the people we have sex with or wont with us the airplane we ride or walk out of is all a part of deaths sadistic

its justa strange woman waltzes into my office today tells me she murdered her parents and can prove satan exists hmmm uhsureiwhat weird the book again sex spelled backwards shi sorry honey i was having the weirdest dream its probably trivial its susans cooking claire thats why uncle james lets them stay shes a talk show host they cant be charmed by definition do you think they have a room here so you dont believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural no i wasnt actually my secretary quite a compliment coming from you doctor you killed my parents you raised me like a son you lied to me my whole life everything you said everything you did so all that bullshit about god and faith you fucking bastard you know i respect that you have such faith james i dont understand it but i want you to know that despite our differences i admire you and i always will but its true i have no faith its strange when that gun was pointed at my face tonight i was surprised but never frightened it was as if i knew nothing could possibly happen to me andin that one moment i didnt care about anything not eve my own life youre right but its funny all my life i thought i was simply a man who didnt believe in any of it yeah it didnt make any sense something he said just before you know how i feel the world is random the only certainty i believe in is death you ready its me put the gun down maya how much time do we have and whats that mean and his message was together no matter what terrific what did he say to you in french so what does it mean the ark sank and the sun set what can i do sure i dont know extra apartment keys whats it matter plenty of time what about after why didnt you just go along with townsend get rid of me i wouldve no oxygen to the brain close call for the first time in a long time its really hitting me lifes tenuous why did you lie to me about your parents deaths thats true were going to do this what do you mean are you alright whats the bible for i dont know probably have a copy of my birth certificatemy apartment that cant be right my birthdays tomorrow hang on get it up go on higher what you okay what whats theoh shit ill go outside and take a look in the garage im going to look around what are you looking for exactly when townsend tried to kill me he said something strange like the time of transformation is near and if what youre saying is true what would happen to me sothen the coroners report is probably wrong i meanthis is ridiculous theres been a mistake i dont believe any of this i looked at the coroners report my fathers o positive and my mothera negative yes so what yes i know but i was baptized and i certainly wasnt born of incest i dont understand whats going on if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again my parents are dead dont even think of bringing them into this im not going to be drawn into this you should think about getting professional help trick him why didnt birdson just say so what and the point is why did he try to kill me last night a guy named john townsend tried to shoot me and now i find out you knew him what the fuck is going on we need to talk well why should i alright whats your name where do you live when did you kill your parents and this is evil the guy had an aneurysm and now hes in a coma where do you get off pretending to be my secretary so whatd i miss i cranked it all the way up nothing but hum it was blank nothing on it you gave me the wrong one i think you gave me the wrong one the world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil unfortunately i find it much more slippery and elusive place ill bet i do whats that got to do with you well then it all seems to be working out for you listen ms oooooohkayyyyyy well by saying that youre acknowledging the existence of a higher power which to a narcissist is impossible a narcissist doesnt admit it its the extreme of selfdenial not the most popular opinion but yes listen im sorry but im running late not pure evil thats correct thank you do you work in the building you coming from the party yes and you are may i help you as a narcissist he couldnt blame himself he created the voices after the fact get out of here you know what you can go nothing you couldnt find out from reading the papers and youre already wrong on one count id appreciate it if youd put that back ill be at bedford tonight if you need me i think its gon na be a waste of time what about that psychic whats his name szabo we millionaires yet yeah you know what they say you have the same chance of winning whether you play or not lem me guess the lottery of course right if you believe in god as a narcissist viznick couldnt blame himself for the alleged murders he created the voices after the fact in order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides george viznick and that george viznick needs to pay well george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum viznick is not psychotic hes simply unable to submit to any higher authority well we all have a degree of narcissism sally but a malignant narcissist is dangerously selfobsessed as if theres another cause for little voices no sally viznicks a manipulator hes clever he has what i call malignant narcissism there werent any voices no the less mystifying good and evil are only illusions there is no such thing as evil with a capital e that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings well longterm exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject after awhile you begin to make friends with it so to speak thanks for having me sally where is she now she told me she killed them what happened parents died she came to me with a wild story about demonic possession its another day i think im alright whats up thanks again for everything thanks for handling this he could see me hes looking right at me youre too old to smoke wont be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid seems george isnt making too many friends in lockup whats this really you know seeing these guys away from the court the facade slips you catch things mike oh

just wander around playing detective youre living a dream kid a dead wife to pine for and a sense of purpose to your life a romantic quest which you wouldnt end even if i wasnt in the picture to set yourself a puzzle you wont ever solve you know how many towns how many guys called james g or john g shit leonard im a john g no you took them out just some guy does it even matter who i stopped asking myself why a long time ago no reason no conspiracy just bad fucking luck a couple of junkies too strung out to realize that your wife didnt live alone when you killed him ive never seen you so happy i was convinced youd remember but it didnt stick like nothing ever sticks like this wont stick im not i was the cop assigned to your wifes death i believed you i thought you deserved the chance for revenge i helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night the guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife we found him and you killed him memento green revisions 10499 115a you know when we found your guy and killed him thats right the real john g over a year ago i helped you find him hes already dead i thought so too i was sure youd remember but you didnt you wont remember no you wont why youre never going to know what difference does it make whether he was your guy or not i guess i can only make you believe the things you want to be true huh like ol jimmy down there are you sure sammy didnt have a wife you exposed him for what he was a fraud sammy was a con man a faker like youve told yourself over and over conditioning yourself to believe learning through repetition i dunno your wife surviving the assault her not believing about your condition the doubt tearing her up inside the insulin you tell everyone about sammy everyone wholl listen remember sammy jankis remember sammy jankis great story gets better every time you tell it so you lie to yourself to be happy nothing wrong with that we all do who cares if theres a few little things youd rather not remember that and your thing well i hope its not as serious as his cos this guys dead no dont worry im a cop everythingll be okay is he still breathing whats wrong wouldnt be appropriate im a snitch hes a cop from out of town looking for information the local boys put us in touch cos he fucking told me he thinks its funny hes laughing at you he knows youre no good on the phone so he calls you up

ichimerai good biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof oh hunt please one cant hold nyah responsible for her actions she wouldnt be here if it wasnt for you hunt from this moment youre responsible for what happens to her and if youre looking out for her wellbeing i suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me balls in your court hunt whatve you got to say nyahs waiting for your answer somebodys been slipping you our mail come on out here you bad girl why you going to make me a better offer yep youve provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer i knew where it was you know that was the hardest part of having to portray you grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes and youre happy about that if you look at hunts operational history he invariably favors misdirection and deception for a start he wont go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security nyah which means mr mccloy we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options well borrow your thirty million to buy those options your stocks never sold above thirtyone dollars a share well agree to buy at fifty now heres the way its going to workwallis the shares outstanding are in any case we dont want your cash not exactly wallis its that time goin other words youre calling her a flake she doesnt belong here sean let her go than thirtyseven million pounds not really what was the top bid there it is guys the last of it oh then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the cdc scientists in atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the antivirus and still have it be effective you knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for i wouldve thought the hardest part was exercising restraint curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 you never figured out where the virus really was beats fighting the flu im here to tell you fight a bit of a cold not going in from the ground show me the atrium billy make sure nyahs not followed unless we dose her with bellerophon on the next ninetyseven minutes nyah will kill herself so first things first swanbeck said theres no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts wrong all weve got to worry about is ambrose nyah will take care of nyah ill be damned its mccloy the biocyte ceo not at all but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site or hard wired a mythjust a mythshouldnt you be checking out their countersurveillance its okay she scrambled the transmission luther continue feeding the gps her position no no should i no no you who dont have a conscience what did you think you were doing no time to explain youve done well and were so close so close its critical that you do whatever ambrose asks dont worry itll be over soon thats a promise come on now off you go nyah its very important not do anything to alarm ambrose its going to be okay are you okay easy easy easy shhh hes touched your heart youre overwhelmed you need to think it over youll meet him somewhere in a month if youre not out in 48 hours im coming in and getting you out give me the ear piece i want you out of australia i dont know how much more plainly i can put it nyah youve done more than enough even the best of snake charmers get bit i want iyou out of therei you noticed whatre you going to do spank me betting table twelve off the paddock nyah are you up to this affirmative bids from possible chimera buyers to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money ive no doubt have you met them we know him hes over your left shoulder looking right at you as you go on just like old times hows it going everything okay well forewarned is forearmed and while were at it be especially sensitive to any sudden change in ambroses plans especially any involving you youll be fine im going to lose you hes got you on qantas flight 2735 its going to be delayed you dont trust me before you are well i mean its not a total loss it is keeping a very capable thief off the street look i cant run your arrest in cnn but i guarantee hes monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world for what they might be saying about him if nothing else hes got the ability and we assume the desire to get you out of there what wouldnt make him suspicious then feel better look would it make you feel better if i didnt want you to do this can you think of a better one generally i dont favor coercing someone not when theres a chance my life could end up in their hands i dont you can be a thief and have a conscience something like that so would i but its not mine to give go and insinuate yourself back into seans life this wasnt what i had in mind nyah sean ambrose for one and six billion in the world five sixhundred thousand damn youre beautiful of what so do i sort of i dont know that they pinched it dont even know that theyre blokes so where did i got right which is not revealing information doesnt necessarily make someone a liar theyve got a book for everything oh wellthis isnt exactly by the book care to wait a decent interval ethan hunt scotland yard interpol every dutch authority i can make them go away i need your help and i thin you can use mine pull over and listen to me will you just listen hi would you mind slowing down not really i triggered the alarm you didnt do that badly working under adverse conditions highly adverse conditions wanted to see how good you were im hoping we might work together at least you walked well senor de larena theres no reason to disrupt your party any longer we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards which youll receive in our written report by fax in the morning hard copy to follow shall we under the circumstances i think we would recommend resetting the senors to respond to a lighter load how do you feel about forty kilos miss hall i wouldnt do that hey you put me here i just do what im told torque wrench far right oh either way works for me think youre the only one who can pick a lock uhhuh what if i pay the rent theres not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad oh well i think that can be arranged no you just looked as if you did do you know me not sure some sort of vacation ill let you know where im going i dont no exactly i do no i dont but in this case by fire thats the best way really well bellerophon it turns out was only really effective against chimera yes yes i gathered as much id thank you but im not sure that was a compliment youd like me to conduct my own debriefing arent you even curious about why she did it she sacrificed herself you mean that leaves miss hall yes i believe thats right we think weve got our finger on the buyer not yet we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage very i dont think i can get her to do it shes got no training for this kind of thing you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief and then what excuse me if thats what youre thinking ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane locating him in time to stop something like that terrorists in order to do that ive got to figure out how he plans to make money with it right now only ambrose knows that sean feels he hasnt done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it so theres one thing we know ambrose doesnt you know we had reservations about each other isnt it a little late in the day to be asking me that twice if he didnt want to go anywhere without me how did you get him on the flight like its a good idea to pick him up in a hurry and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier so lets get on with it hes still in sydney an idea yeah you got ta be kidding like what well youre sorry and im sorry sorry i didnt let you know where i was im fineand you you keep calling me dmitri you really shouldnt not in time to save him he was quite a man did he know before the end you two had succeeded sorry it couldnt be under happier circumstances theyre ready and waiting youll soon be with old friends you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it doctor good job and thanks copy shes only got twentyeight minutes left track ahead and pick her up luther say again ninetyseven minutes twentyseven seconds luther im looking at security im not waiting 48 hours when were done at biocyte if shes not out of ambroses im going in and getting her out now how to get in there lets start from the inside out nyah still on the property i kill chimera at biocyte and hes sitting on a cure without a disease ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane but he didnt get the chimera virus i told her to get outta there i dont know but nekhorvich was not a manic get me a twenty on nyah nyah ambrose is heading back theres an enveloped inside confirm left jacket pocket left jacket pocket yep lutherget us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month including photos of the victims why not nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules in the myth bellerophon killed chimera a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon put in the coordinates and lets get a visual the visuals arent coming upand the checks in the mall were down to seven minutes 23 seconds range is two kay not for seven more minutes right in the building billy i think we got a problem nyahs on the wing up early billy do you copy im not ready so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloys got chimera what manic invents disease like that in the first place why would he do it it is billy hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one he shouldve have killed the virus in the incubation areanyahs exited the elevator on the same level as the lab five and a half minutes hes breached the hot zone shes in the elevator heading toward ethan i am she is im booted up go ethan so what did he say shes on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs one klick away ethan i keep telling you theres not a chance of locating nyah til i access the satellite and theres not a chance of doing that til i get this thing booted up and running how much time does she have left oh uh commencing diversion alarm in cosmetics thirtysecond opening in the roof and a 250foot drop no garage entrance lobbys protected by five guards on rotating patrol all storage and production of chimera is done here in this lab on the fortysecond floor the heart of the building sorry that it a biocyte facility their storage structure youve got the voice print ill get us in yeah why else would he come back to australia if he had them both he could sell them anywhere she must still be on the property left jacket pocket confirmed roger that ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope put it in his inner left jacket pocket nekhorvichs boss right i guess there arent many flu epidemics in the middle of summer that simple huh the satellite doesnt work as fast as i do its the transponderoh you dont have to do that wouldnt be a vacation if you did well hunt what are your plans where is she now by the way do you know in this case it wasnt a bad idea in face it was a pretty damn good idea just dont make a habit of it and as for ms hall in light of her efforts her criminal records will certainly be expunged im assuming you approve but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus id be very interested to know how after youd managed its recovery intact it subsequently got destroyed and that appears to have been destroyed it also contained the antivirus bellerophon and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose of course it was anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do is bound to get a little flak here and there you try flogging the stories on cnn ive had to come up with about whats been going on around here the last few days at any rate its been most instructive what theyll swallow or what theyll broadcast with a straight face miss halls blood it appears has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus not even antibodies why not youve done just about everything else on this operation sorry ethan i dont quite know where to begin any suggestions no i cant afford to be curious and neither can you hunt something else brave girl if you can get hold of bellerophon with the time limit you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice but in either case youve got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her after that its out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law and hunt however you obtain it we want you to preserve a sample of chimera bring it back alive good then if you manage to get hold of ambrose and obtain what hes got youve got 8 hours 57 minutes and twentythree seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of chimera on earth yes i believe thats right now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure the victim becomes infectious highly infectious but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera do you even assuming youre able to prevent ambrose selling chimera youve now got an additional problem you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte if ambrose is going to sell chimera now hell have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss halls blood to market we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority but that wont stop ambrose and beyond him we dont know who else were looking for all terrorist bank accounts of which were aware are stable no deposits no withdrawals therefore no suspects well its not mission idifficulti hunt its mission iimpossiblei difficult should be a walk in the park for you if you can think of a quicker way to get to ambrose youre welcome to try oh by the way you might want to take a look at theseif you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job you mean itll be difficult go to bed with a man and lie to him shes a woman shes got all the training she needs well then i mislead you or you made the wrong assumption either way were asking her to resume a prior relationship not do anything she hasnt already done then makes sure she continues to see him gets him confide in her and report to you miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously she walked away and hes wanting her back ever since we believe shes our surest and quickest way of location him is where miss hall comes in well you know nekhorvichs history youre the one who got him out of the soviet union was it still in bio weapon business right in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts in any case youve got to recover chimera and bring it to us the question is why what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers then you do think it was ambrose not necessarily what did you think of him when i couldnt find you i had to replace you sean ambrose was the obvious choice he double you what two three times you were there dr vladimir nekhorvich is dead so is his colleague gradski but that happened earlier we had nekhorvich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies like youre sorry and im sorry why did you phrase it like that dont be wouldnt be on vacation if you didhow much you weigh right now fry huh tried to kill us in our sleep paris had it right we are disposable were just walking ghosts to her she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin tried to kill us no no youre right fry whats to be afraid of my life is a steamin pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow so i say mush on canyons only couple hundred meters after that were in skiff city so why dont you just butch up stuff a cork in that kid and get i dunno nice breeze wide open spaces you know im startin to enjoy myself out here hey youre the one who got me out here turned me into a goddamn sled dog an now you spect me to go back like a whipped dog we arent completely stupid so you noticed too you give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you he will leave you all out there to die hell lead you over the first cliff you know that dont you 79 kilos what the hells it matter hey why dont you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesnt involve mass suicide smoke screen for what look we got ta think about everyone now the kid especially how scared is she gon na be out there oh lady if youre in your right mind i pray you go insane sokay sokay i killed it my first runin with riddick went for the sweetspot and missed they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there i can feel it sometimes pressing against the cord so maybe the care and feeding of my nerveendings is my business owens was already dead his brain just hadnt caught on to that fact not a problem unless youre gon na make you have a little caffeine in the morning i have a little morphine so what i never said i was i wont give him a chance to grab another ship or to slash another pilots throat hes a murderer the law says hes got ta do his bid we need a failsafe bring the cells over at the last possible minute when the wings are ready when we know were ready to launch mayve noticed chains dont work on this guy only way were truly safe is if he believes hes goin free but if he stops believin thats what i said he also figured out how to kill the pilot fry hijacked a prison transport made a helluva good run fore i tracked him down were not sure when it happens so lets not lets wait on the power cells wha lets board this up and get the hell gone they seem to stick to the dark so if we stick to daylight should be all rag it riddick nobody wants your theories on 25 kilos each huh

defying the practical laws of physics in order to end up together a five hundred foot thick steel wall but the connection between these two electrons is so inside every semiconductor you have two particles with opposite charges separated by an impassable barrier thats what it asked me what do you want i didnt answer i was in the middle of an experiment god i dunno the eternal nothingness mia how nothing is real until its perceived a quantum one could be at the subatomic level particles obey their own logic they connect in unimaginable ways its an experiment thats the physicists playground

yep eloped you sure about this that went well come on where the hell are we little boy thats him like hell wait remember julia hickson is priority number one nothing else matters find out where she is yes i am a child can experience abuse worse than charlies and grow up to be someone who would never ever hurt another living thing what difference does it make maybe this is a big fucking waste of time evil its hard for me to see stargher as human capable of something like remorse whoa hold on arent they the same guy this is stargher were talking about you think you can do this dont you what about julia i did yeah youre the shrink you tell me what did you see thats what therapists are for right absolutely i suppose everyone does peter okay ah the part of us that cant be explained what

dont understand why i cant do this this isnt some troubled kid youre dealing with sometimes once theyve been caught they feel a need for disclosure they have so much they want to tell but theyve never had a sympathetic ear they need someone to understand why stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully it was part of the ritual some werent found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean but these last three they were still in water always in water but listen he wasnt just careless it went beyond that theres always a chance theyll confess as far as i needed

federal bureau of investigation maam we know all see all thanks you six weeks off does a body good i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward dr kent is she alright i am im a pretty boring guy no no prevacid for my stomach absolutely no into stargher inside when we got here you just topped and pulled her out ill get her stargher is in custody the functional equivalent of being

no idea but it looks like a long way we think in miles not kilometers i dont know im american yeah ok forget it we wont tell anyone were going to swim one or two kilometers across open sea from one uninhabited island to another something goes wrong what then oh great not far at all i dont like to be negative but do you think we should let someone know where were going yes of course i can swim how far do you think it is thats the wrong one nice work it would be nice though if there was a place like that you know that no one could get to oh that noise yes he certainly did the noise dont worry youre on holiday bonjour if its too far then well drown but if we donï½t try then well never know sorry i thought i was doing quite well exactly there are infinite worlds out there where anything that can happen does happen you realize that in the eternity of space there is a planet just like this one where you are photographing back towards us youre photographing yourself i think so too francoise no swim so from there to there hi there here take a look not too bad eh bonsoir uhhuh so woman bites chicken leg turns out to be a mouse or a rat its an urban myth where did you lose itits the same what happened to what they gave you what are you thinking calling me at home with a message like that youve compromised me and our relationship i cant do that helena helena please this is out of your hands have you gone crazy you are not carl you arent as good as carl they are moving the trial to a high security location the press has gone berserk the jury will be influenced stay out of things let us try to win the case that was a stupid thing you did incredibly stupid i remember when i first met you little helen watts from the wrong side of somewhere i had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed laundromats for the washing of money unfortunately carl had only one successful business even if i knew i wouldnt tell you you do not want to come into contact with these people only carl knows who they are thats his real asset ruiz doesnt know them they dont know ruiz church and state yes i told you before there are people who owe you money but theyre not paying theres too much heat on carl helena if i had it i would give it to you but i dont have that kind of money this place is swept twice a day i learned that in miami in 85 then the us shut down the whole caribbean but its a big game of wackamole knock it down in miami it pops up here and san diego is so much more relaxing i suspect hell accept his payment in publicity youre gon na get through it but the first thing we do is get michael adler to represent carl we get adler and we beat this thing of course he is ive known him for twenty years and he doesnt jaywalk thats a very apt analogy helena now go home and be with your children i dont know but under no circumstances would i talk about it here i want you to go home and relax the best you can continue your life as if nothing has happened that is very important got it good do not discuss anything over the telephone do not talk to the neighbors stay out of your yard good from now on i want you to expect that every word you utter will be taperecorded that the movement of your lips is being read got it listen to me carefully first of all carl isnt here deas got him and theyll hang on to him until arraignment which will probably be tomorrow so here youre wasting your time are you with me i understand youre upset you want to know whats going on thats good helena im so sorry carl carl think about it if i was trying to rip you off i would have left town after ruiz was killed i wouldnt sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal carl thats insane i just didnt want to take a chance i didnt want to risk it it could have been frozen along with everything else i was just waiting for the right time what carl im running late im coming right now yeah like turning into a beautiful woman remember when

here this is the best situation youre going to have for a long long time nobody said shit eduardo no of course not shes one of the top students at her school i i dont really know i dont know what you mean still this was a sensitive issue for me and i wanted to thank you personally i appreciate you coming in so early shell be at a pawn shop in an hour sos the video camera god i dont get it are we supposed to say to ourselves be prepared to lose her be prepared to lose our child why does this happen to someone how does it happen about the other night im sorry no not yet yeah because the alternative is to be bored to death i have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day thats different yeah well she has a way of self medicating that probably seems familiar too look im as worried as you are the first thing we have to do is present a unified front barbara i think we may have found our mexican drug czar its this general salazar at least ill have somebody on the other side i can talk to explain to me how you could think that i shouldnt know about this explain to me how this wouldnt be relevant to me as a parent how long have you known space for what to od like that other kid i will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents because it isnt correct to begin with shes only sixteen yearsold this is different stop you experimented in college i dont want to hear about that well ground her clip her wings a bit school and scheduled activities and thats it until further notice this has to be handled delicately dan kelly in the district attorneys office will probably help us out quietly christ this could be embarrassing i think shes lying thats frustrating drugs begin pouring out of america into every other country in the world canada is completely overwhelmed oh yes i can what is wrong with you what youre going away youre getting help somewhere okay young lady thats it where is it where are the drugs where are they its a presidential appointment so until i quit or get fired i dont know as it happens the president of the united states my new boss the leader of the free world has me penciled in for some face time somehow i dont see that happening fine legalization okay forgetting all of our international trade agreements legalize everything today the government inserts itself into all drug transactions the us becomes a giant pharmacy our borders are mobbed lines of people from here to europe wanting to smoke snort and shoot themselves into oblivion whats it like imagine youre being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of calcutta except the beggars are wearing 1500 suits and they dont say please or thank you medicinal marijuana initiative or am i being cynical depends on the state you can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff three categories you like me you hate me you want something from me definitely third category depends who its from is it possible to have a drug czar in mexico who isnt connected in some war to one of the cartels that would probably mean the tijuana cartel is gaining power let me ask you a hypothetical question if salazar worked for madrigal and the juaraz cartel and he went out of power would it mean the juarez cartel is losing influence so whats it doing in tijuana the cocaine brand 911 is an east coast brand a juarez cartel brand and you must know it usually comes through into el paso if i ever return to the bench counselor adler i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country noriega is a criminal michael you represent drug dealers not civil libertarians which part getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities that triple the amount of stuff is going through any way we can do it better what do you look for any idea how much just tell me where she is ill pay you a thousand dollars i have it in my wallet i have money i need to find my daughter ill pay you im looking for my daughter caroline she comes here i cant believe you used to bring my daughter here to this place you want to help stay the fuck away from her you dont know what the hell youre talking about youre a cocky seventeen yearold and you dont have a clue what the stakes are you dont know the value of the life youve yet to throw away and neither does she what i dont give a fuck about your parents im not the police i dont care about experimentation shes a kid im worried to death can you tell me anything do you have any ideas she hasnt called you she snuck away and we havent seen her she hasnt come home let me ask you a related question weve talked about the supply side but what about demand what is your policy for treating addiction hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem youve been making very good progress against the tijuana cartel id like to bring you up to washington walk you around our side of things and share some of the information weve been able to develop on your cartels ill get there as soon as i can what i thought madrigal was dead i thought it was verified hello like you protected landry i mean who runs interdiction on the mexico side who do we interface with on their side he died in a liposuction surgery right who are these guysi have a lock on the door ill keep it in my office room what did i say four my son jeb its a gift for him wrap it upyes ask if he can check how many sick days ive taken since ive worked here wow oh is noel in i dont know megan i had a nightmare one night and i didnt wake you up so you could tell me it was okay i think that was the first time does that count what about the game im not sure soft and wet thats very interesting what was that my turn whats your favorite song as a color not as rust you know a rust colored paint or wood i think rust jeremy what the hell are you doing jesus out again would you like to try going hes dealing with a lot of things i think he needs to find answers himself what do i do when im around someone i know when you work with clients on machines do they sometimes just jump up a level or two do something they didnt know they were capable of i remember you yeah megan where are you calling from megan oh oh shit when was the last time i wore pink no thats it yes thats strange isnt it not remembering one fever or a cold or a sore throat what do you think that means megan do you ever remember me getting sick do you remember me getting sick i havent been sick this year i know that hes asleep i know im still going to new york just not this second i dont think i got the job in new york no and i have been sick i spent a week in a hospital when i was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool they were dunking me i swallowed water they didnt know it and they almost killed me heroes dont get killed like that normal people do you have a problem elijah my wife is right somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it stop messing with my life elijah my son almost shot me last night he wanted to prove you were right i must have felt some lump in his back when i bumped him most guns have a black or silver handle i had a fiftyfifty shot at the color quick i have to go now the guy might not have been carrying anything okay i dont want to play this game anymore listen i got to be on the sidelines during the game you can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at i dont know what youre asking yes like what i got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants like on tv i thought he was carrying something probably the army jacket those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show i got you a seat in the seven hundred level its nosebleed territory but at least you wont get spit on that guy in green sometimes people carry weapons in here then they drink too much theyre team isnt doing so well bad things happen we do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying if hes carrying hell step out of line just give me a minute are you for real were not proceeding anywhere together what do you want its for last weeks game i see guys like you all the time in my work you find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story utterly convincing and somewhere in there you slip it in i just need your credit card numberi just need a small down payment whats this about this is obviously some scam is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment at the church you were following me werent you what was your idea elijah you forgot the now im going to tell you what the hell is going on step see usually that comes before the its over step and it always always comes before the you can go step what is over you assumed wrong in college a car accident skeptical about what seventyfive percent i dont know for sure i dont think so hes kind of a miracle hes doing well today we are its a pleasure to meet you im david dunne when yeah send him packing im not walking all the way over there whats he look like jeremy if you pull that trigger im going to leave im going to go to new york jeremy listen to what im not i just didnt connect it that was me they were talking about i almost died that was me elijah was wrong know what thats great i see theres no more left how many did you put on that time what do you do if something happens two hundred and seventy how much did you take off no jeremy no you put too much thats two hundred and fifty pounds no no theres nothing to do im going to work out jeremy im going in i have to do some things whyd you do that im going to go in in under six seconds ive heard how about your room then if you get scared like before you can come back in here i think its be better if i was alone jeremy why dont you go sleep with your mom he doesnt look very threatening yeah hello not really you represent someone in philadelphia but im afraid of water so thats been holding my career back a little bit what a coincidence im a male synchronized swimmer and im looking for representation you like sports no no yes where are the rest of the passengers against a window fine okaywhat about jeb im listening do you see any telletubbies around here do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it do you see a little asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it no well thats what you see at a toy store any you must think this is a toy store cause youre in here shopping for an infant named jeb one of us has made a gross error and wasted the other persons valuable time no no no no no you need to go now no how old is jeb once again please youve made a considerably wise decision are you finished i never said you couldnt be killed i never said that thats not what i witnessed david the car accident you were in was there anyone else involved one last question or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants its an exaggeration of the truth maybe its based on something as simple as instinct like being able to touch someone and tell whether theyve done something wrong or the level of what theyve done wrong characters in comic books are often attributed special powers xray vision things of that sort youre skill have you ever tried to develop it telling when people have done something wrong you have good instincts when it comes to things like that but not a knife you thought he was carrying a knife how did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon is there a problem you could have poured coffee in starbucks you could have learned to install track lighting in office buildings you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet you could have been one of ten thousand things but in the end you chose to protect people you made that decision and i find that very very interesting now all i need is your credit card number why is it do you think that of all the professions in the world you chose protection weve already begun not money but i appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner it will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution ive come to understand that an ill advised purchase in the parking lot youve misunderstood technically no i gambled that you would attend the church service i just waited for you this city has had its share of disasters well publicized ones it was around the time of that plane crash when it first entered my head and there it stayed as i waited and watched the news over the years and then one day i see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed and just like that an idea blossoms into the flower of possible reality the life of an idea that has lived too long in my head i assumed because of the train was it serious whats he talking about your answer to my question its one thing to have never been injured in your life but to state that youve never taken ill well thats a whole new level seventyfive percent thats not nearly good enough for me im extremely skeptical how certain are you that you havent been sick in your life youve never been sick i believe comic books are based loosely on reality i believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth i believe your husband is one of those individuals i own a comic book museum its called the limited edition there have been three major disasters in this city over the last four years ive followed each one of them a seventhreeseven crashes on take off one hundred and seventytwo die no survivors a hotel fire downtown two hundred and eleven die no survivors and am amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city one hundred and thirty one die one survivor he is unharmed ive spoken with your husband about his survival i suggested a rather unbelievable explanation since then ive come to believe that my explanation however unbelievable is in fact true and everyone lived happily ever after you and my mother would have a special connection how so now youre going to have to tell me more how did you get together how long have you been married where is it why im not going out anymore im not getting hurt again this was the last time i told youdont be scared ill just shoot him once youre lying you wont get hurt youre secret identity that man was right i know now do you know why im not scared im sleeping in my room all of it get mom how much is it i lied what if he wasnt aloud to kick and you were really mad at him i mean if you knew karate how much can you lift what if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday for a year what if you worked out everyday for six months you think you could beat him then you think you could beat up mike tyson i mean before he started wiggin out and eating peoples ears ill help you what things just one just play one set of downs i told them you were great he going pro in the draft they say he can run the fifty i wont make any noise i want to sleep here tonightdid you get up from your seat was
