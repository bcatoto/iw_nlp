symington says and whats that i see please sit down among persons such as yourself creative people under great stress erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of its

to give us something to do isnt it come on but we cant just sit here so are we it looks like go back im going to kill him mother go back ive tried to warn you scientists are always pawns of the military mistake were all alone here they waited until everyone was on shiftleave to do this reliant is supposed to be at our disposal not viceversa who does that about do it every time we have dealings with starfleet i get nervous were dealing with something that could be perverted into a dreadful weapon remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with thats exactly the par for the course you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner well dont have kittens genesis is going to work theyll remember you in a wreath with newton einstein surak come on mother thats just the military mentality never put off tomorrow what you can put off today if theres one atom of life how can you let them pull that stuff on you theyre just lazy mainly and also that im proud very proud to be your son i was wrong about you and im sorry so am i my friends were killed too but good words thats where ideas begin maybe you should listen to them you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life that makes two of us lieutenant saavik was right you never have faced death no i i guess im not what you expected are you running away from me i dont mean to intrude you cant we encoded four minutes hes on a build up to detonation its the genesis wave we appear to have plenty of time shes making it up my father was professor im doctor marcus we were still there you dumb bastard we could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room i dont know dont you believe it what are you looking at let go he cant young i feel young doctor hours instead of days saavik now we have minutes instead of hours we each face death every day were alive saavik and almost got tossed out of the academy now thats what i call a meal our first order of business is survival do you have anything to eat i dont know about anyone else but im starved then this will be your big chance to get away from it all where they went saavik they even killed the galley chief hes been there and hasnt found what he wants can you spare someone there may be people hurt i got beat were only alive because i knew something about these ships that he didnt at the moment that question takes a back seat to preventing him from laying his hands on it you said it yourself were talking about a bang that would rearrange the universe computer request security procedure and access to project genesis summary as a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of reopening old wounds the inspection will continue once were underway doctor ah dont mince words bones tell me what you really think and who am i hiding from spare me your notions of poetry please we all have our assigned duties and bones i dont want to be lectured thank you amazing i dont know what to say but im allergic to retlax uh what are they cheers bones these are charming im almost afraid to what did you bring me contraband klingon twentytwo eightythree romulan ale bones you know this stuff is illegal bless me doctor and what beams you into this neck of the woods theyll learn galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young doctor im not a drama critic physician heal thyself something spock was trying to tell me on my birthday it is a far far better thing i do than i have ever done before a far better resting place i go to than i have ever known you did this in a day why why didnt you tell me wait carol what order whos taking genesis taking genesis who who is taking genesis repeat whats wrong whats wrong message breaking up carol whats wrong whats wrong is that what you came here to say i am truly sorry im trying david it was just words not like this no i havent faced death i cheated death i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity i know nothing i didnt expect anything i suppose i was i poured a drink would you like it uh no i should be on the bridge well beam aboard and stop it how soon what its a long story why didnt you tell me wheres dr marcus im admiral kirk khan still old friend youve managed to kill just about everyone else but like a poor marksman you keep missing the target here it comes now spock i take your point stand by to receive our transmission khan how do i know youll keep your word to prevent an enemy from doing just what were attempting using our console to tap in a message an order to lower reliants damn shields give me some time to recall the data on our computers genesis whats that khan listen to me if its me you want ill have myself beamed aboard all i ask is that you spare my crew what is the meaning of this attack where is the crew of the reliant uhura send to commander reliant prepare to be boarded im going down to the station we dont have minutes can you give me phaser power scotty whats left well be going to warp speed an emergency situation has arisen by order of starfleet command as of now 1800 hours i am assuming command of this vessel duty officer so note in the ships log plot a new course for space laboratory regula i mr scott well beam aboard alert transporter room saavik for gods sake tell her were all right sensors captain do it while we have time on screen scotty lets have it spock picture mr saavik try the emergency channels uhura cant you augment hell die all right well do the job with auxiliary power no promises mr scott on your way he wants to kill me for passing sentence on him 14 years ago and he doesnt care who stands between him and his vengeance mr scott the word is given every young boys fancy i seem to remember it myself very well mr scott are your engines capable of handling a minor training cruise midshipman youre a tiger oh a wee bout of what mr scott mr scott you old space dog youre well spock this is kirk its two hours are you about ready meaning you cant even beam us back i read you captain lets have it kirk to enterprise damage report spock best speed to regula i kirk out scotty ive got to ask any chance of getting the mains back on the line yes spock if he hadnt wed be space by now the word is given warp speed oh do you have you any idea midshipman preston how many times ive had to listen to mr scott on the comm telling me his troubles have you any idea the ribbing ive had to endure in the officers mess to the effect that the enterprise is a flying death trap i see well shall we start with the engine room your first training voyage mr preston and who is this spock the good of the few yes spock he wont break off now if he followed me this far hell be back but from where uhura patch me in steady as you go best speed scotty scotty can we make it inside uh oh thats it what is working around here establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when youve talked with mr scott all right join the party mr spock the ship is yours engine room scotty do we have enough power for the transporters reliant could be hiding behind that rock blind as a tiberian bat what do you make of the plantoid beyond and no way of knowing if reliant is still in the area wait for my signal spock too soon and hell have time to figure it out and raise them again youve got to learn why things work on a starship its coming through now khan its all weve got at least we know he hasnt got it just keep nodding as though im giving orders saavik punch up the data charts of reliants command console hurry who the hell are they visual mr sulu divert everything to the phasers who who knew just where to hit us and why raise shields energize phasers stand by to is it possible their comm system has failed chekovs on reliant isnt he gentlemen this isnt the tape was made a year ago i can only assume theyve reached phase two by now the power of creation yes give up genesis she said what in gods name does that mean give it up to whom how far will you accompany me to the bridge or the one i would not presume to debate you you are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions but it may be nothing garbled communications why dont you that wont be necessary just take me to regula i i told starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but were the only ship in the quadrant spock those cadets of yours how good are they how will they respond under real pressure something may be wrong at regula i weve been ordered to investigate to be sure captain yes weve been through death and life together permission to come aboard captain home hrummm and where are you off to now it was the best of times it was the worst of times message spock than you yes i see that by the way thank you for this so you said at the time speaking of which your protgs first rare a trifle emotional it had the virtue of never having been tried they destroyed the simulator room and you with it i assume you are loitering here to learn what efficiency rating i plan to give your cadets uhura if you dont hear from us there wont be anybody behind kirk out you gentleman can remain here or captain spock if you do not hear from us within one hour your orders are to restore what power you can take the enterprise to the nearest star base and alert starfleet command when you are out of jamming range damn alert starfleet headquarters i want to talk with starfleet command uhura whats happening damn it in my quarters uhura kirk here yes well why dont you show him around and good i believe you already know my uh son as you were mr saavik dismiss the company ill be in my quarters if needed but i would prefer after you dismiss the company you will take the watch set course for ceti alpha v and well pick up survivors distance from reliant time engine room whats happening time from my mark saavik get us out best speed mr scott can you get the mains back on line cease fire look sharp descend ten thousand meters stand by photon torpedoes mr saavik all stop hold your course look sharp they just dont want us going in there regulation 46a if transmissions are being monitored during battle come come lieutenant you of all people go by the book hello spock you remember dr marcus i changed the conditions of the test i received a commendation for original thinking i dont like to lose i reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now lieutenant whats on your mind lieutenant as your teacher mr spock is fond of saying i like to think there always are possibilities if stage two was completed it was underground she said it was going to be underground erased phasers on stun move out there is no such regulation were finding it please please youve got to give us time the bridge is smashed computers inoperative hurry khan this is damned peculiar yellow alert take the test again we learn by doing lieutenant that was a little joke you may ask lieutenant there is no correct resolution it is a test of character youre bothered by your performance on the kobayashi maru you earned it lieutenant selfexpression does not seem to be one of your problems lieutenant are you wearing your hair differently then you have something new to think about carry on how we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life wouldnt you say a nowin situation is a possibility every commander may face has that never occurred to you and why not very well well mr saavik are you going to stay with the sinking ship prayer mr saavik the klingons do not take prisoners captain best guess mr sulu fire when ready battle stations try again i did nothing except get caught with my britches down i must be senile mr saavik you just keep right on quoting regulations meantime lets find out what the hell is going on and see how bad weve been mr sulu lock phasers on target and await my command scotty mr sulu the shields visual engage warp engines stop engines youve earned it but im still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks i dont believe these kids can steer i cut your new orders personally by the end of the month youll have your first command uss excelsior i really must thank youim afraid i cant stop to discuss this logically but as you are so fond of observing doctor im not human i dont dispute that in the wrong hands i was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications doctor as a matter of cosmic history it has always been easier to destroy than to create it would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix i have been and always will be your friend live long and prosper i never took the kobayashi maru test until now what do you think of my solution or the one the ship out of danger hes intelligent but not experienced his pattern indicates two dimensional thinking sporadic energy readings port side aft could be an impulse turn admiral theyre reducing speed estimating nebula penetration in two minutes reliant is closing i think we can guarantee shell follow us mr saavik remind me to explain to you the concept of human ego she can outrun us and outgun us but there is the mutara nebula at 153 mark four best we could do in two hours not much admiral we have partial main power be careful jim aye sir a distinct possibility regula is class d it consists of various remarkable ores essentially a great rock in space affirmative admiral scanners and sensors still inoperative theres no way to tell whats inside the station lets hope he hasnt changed the combination hes quite intelligent the prefix code is 16309 all commands from each starship bridge are relayed electronically each ship has its own prefix combination code the prefix code admiral you cant give him genesis not enough against their shields too late one thing is certain we can not escape on auxiliary power they knew just where to hit us their coil emissions are normal wait their shields are going up theyre locking phasers it would explain a great many things whats she doing here really dr mccoy you can not ban the acquisition of knowledge because you distrust the moral implications of what you learn logic suggests have they proceeded with their experiments it literally is genesis carol marcus it might help my analysis if i knew what genesis was twelve hours and fortythree minutes present speed there are two possibilities sir they are unwilling to respond they are unable to respond id best talk with mr scott first so that he may in his own words explain the situation to his cadets that is wise in any case were i to invoke logic logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few i was going to remind you of nothing least of all that which you know well your mistake if i may be so bold was promotion commanding a starship is your first best destiny anything else is a waste of material you proceed from a false assumption i am a vulcan i have no ego to bruise excuse my presumption but i do not agree as a teacher on a training mission i am content to command a starship if we are to go on actual duty it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command like all living beings admiral each according to his gifts the ship is yours regula i is a scientific research laboratory if memory serves theres a first time for everything admiral welcome aboard admiral i believe you know my trainee crew certainly they have come to know you the enterprise i must check in before your inspection and you none of which i am consciously aware except of course happy birthday surely the best of times i know of your fondness for antiques shes half romulan jim the admixture makes her more volatile than me for example yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a vulcan mentality the kobayshi maru scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment as i recall you took the test three times yourself your final solution was shall we say unique i am understandably curious i exaggerated certainly lieutenant the admiral is aware of the regulations take her out mr saavik lieutenant how many times have you piloted a starship out of spacedock thank you mr saavik very well mr saavik clear all moorings we cant all be perfect saavik you must control your prejudices and remember that as a vulcan as well as a romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land around you are humans and as a member of the starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence you must learn to tolerance in addition to all else i have taught you tolerance is logical what did you expect lieutenant no power to the weapons system sirno just let him freeze out there why you so damn anxious to let him in here hell no if it did get to him wasnt enough time generator was out what thirty minutes takes the bastards an hour maybe two to absorb somebody now hold on you dumb whats it going to do being a plant let go of me now whod go and do cut bullshit been pulled apart dont walk behind me aint it there cool it palmer you lying bastard i said where whered you

generator chance we got to take we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks the mess hall and the kitchen forget about childs hes over anyplace but here everything thats been missing watching norris in there gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole every piece of you is selfsufficient an animal unto itself when a man bleeds its just tissue but blood from one of you things wont obey its a newly formed individual with a builtin desire to protect its own life when attacked your blood will try and survive and crawl away from a hot needle say were going to draw a little bit of everybodys blood hey somebody open up its me macready come on damn it the towline snapped been crawling around like a seal out here couldnt be possible must have weighted a ton and a half just keep looking well lets get down there yeah whats happened right half of us awake at all times who else could

best chance to blow him away lets open it now lets open it could have been anytime anywhere why didnt it imitate fuchs isnt that its number to get more recruits we got to burn em dont get near em the plants theyre alive those things can imitate anything childs somebody broke in auxiliary light cables been cut what childs wheres that magneto from chopper one happens all the time man theyre falling out of the skies like flies government knows all about it chariots of the gods man they practically own south america i mean they taught the incas everything they knew hes dead what kind of test i aint going with sanchez hope so another ten fifteen minutes what i dont get is somebody definitely messed with it mac where the hell is that pump no it aint there would i be asking if it were there and that was enough hows that thing get to the dogs i though we stopped it in time oh i got you not too long blair hes gone berserk fourand why please tell us would you think that what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years this is a why why would you do that you didnt write that figure and how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years youve just said you signed it you swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago they lied indeed when did they lie and do you know what a lie is you know these doctors could have settled out of court they wanted a trial they wanted to clear their names then please which is correct youve sworn today the patient ate one hour ago four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago which is the lie when were you lying and wasnt that an oath these are your initials here kc when you signed this chart you took an oath no less important than that which you took today isnt that right isnt that right now id like to ask you something four years ago when you were working as a nurse are you aware that drs towler and marx based their treatment of deborah ann kaye on this chart that you signed sworn before god you would tell the truth just now in fact youve just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury youve just sworn to that isnt that right you would not yes it is a crime a serious crime you are aware of the penalties for perjury objection do you indeed ill bet you do fine fine well save the court the time we will admit the doctor as an expert witness fine yes weve heard that doctor you testify quite a bit against other physicians isnt that right you youre available for that when youre paid to be there uhhuh still practice a lot of medicine how old are you of anesthesiology what book is that how is that do you know dr robert towler orthopedics neurology im sure it is but this is massachusetts doctor certified in internal medicine are you boardcertified in anesthesiology doctor engaged to render an opinion for a price is that correct youre being paid to be here today dr thompson just so the jury knows you never treated deborah ann kaye is that correct and you would come here and on a slip of memory four years ago youd ruin their lives your honor your honor weve touched on this his own witness has said objection weve ed concannon thank you your honor further ms costello is a rebuttal witness as a surprise witness she may only serve to rebut direct testimony as her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form which has been disallowed i request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here thank you your honor we object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite mcgee versus state of indiana us 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the uniform code the admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed and your honor having given the plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now we object to the admission of the xerox form no further questions objection this is ri expect us to accept a photocopy we have the original right nothing further your honor my doctors didnt want a settlement at any price they wanted this cleared up in court they want their vindication i agree with them but for today the offer stands before we begin the publicity of a trial for today only when i walk out that door the offer is withdrawn as long as you understand that its got to be that way your honor bishop brophy and the archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars tell us you reached down into death now isnt that right to save her and to save the baby is that a patient riddled with complications questionable information on her on her admitting form you brought thirty years of medical experience to bear isnt that what you did and what did your team do and her heart stopped and she wasnt getting oxygen she threw up in her mask lets cut the bullshit say it she threw up in her mask tell me one why wasnt she getting oxygen code blue what does that mean what did these people do when her heart stopped dr towler who was in the operating room with you anything special about the case you were there to help dr marx deliver her baby were you not answer affirmatively simply keep those answers to three words you werent part of a group you were her anesthesiologist isnt that right you were the anesthesiologist at her delivery may twelfth nineteen seventy say it whatever the truth is lets hear that you were her doctor dont equivocate be positive just tell the truthi did i have been practicing medicine for fortysix years and i know when an injustice has been done sir yes when a thing is wrong as in this case i am available i am seventyfour years old i am not boardcertified im on the staff of i am seventyfour years old methodology and techniques of anesthesiology yes meth methodology and technique through through his book i know of him im just an md no no no i am not its quite common in new york state just as you are sir that is correct i was engaged to render an opinion you sure you dont want me to stay on you know sometimes people can surprise you sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth im afraid thats not true will you want me to stay on till monday i didnt do too well for you its my opinion it took him much longer nine ten minutes theres too much brain damage cardiac arrest during delivery her heart stopped when the heart stops the brains deprived of oxygen you get brain damage that is why shes in the state shes in today theres nothing they can do to me what difference would i made a reservation at from what ive seen mr galvin you have a very good case thats what id planned to it was good of you to meet i um i given the limits of your question thats correct i in that small context i would have i would have to say no well code blue actually yes its by no means bad i i made a detailed physical examination of the patient sir yesterday evening i i am on the staff of i am seventyfour years old she went in complaining of stomach cramps good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance she they gave her the wrong anestheticmy god we tried to save her you cant know you cant know yes we did everything we could yes well we thats right shed aspirated vomitus into her mask well many reasons actually its a common medical expression its a crash program to restore the heartbeat dr marx cut an airway in her trachea to get her oxygen her and the baby ms nevins we went to code blue mary rooney the obstetrical nurse ms nevins nurseanesthetist dr marx of course thank you when debby when she yes yes i was one of a group of i was her doctor yes no actually she was referred to me she was dr hagmans patient negligent yes it would have been criminal but that was not the case she threw up in her mask yes but she hadnt eaten one hour prior to admission yes i yes it is yes i wrote itah how did they treat you good you ever been inside a hospital abrams yes how are you today mr abraham that that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life shes in a coma her life is gone she has no family she has no home shes tied to a machine she has no friends and the people who should care for her her doctors and you and me have been bought off to look the other way we have been paid to look the other way i came in here to take your money i brought snapshots to show you so i could get your money i cant take it if i take it if i take that money im lost im just going to be a rich ambulance chaser i cant do it i cant take it and no one will know the truth yes it would be because it struck me how neatly three went into the amount two hundred ten thousand that would mean i keep seventy you thought it was just how did you settle on the amount they want to settle it means a lot of money thats the call that im waiting for this is going to drive the ante up to get somebody from a boston hospital to say hell testify you know what that would mean he wants to testify gruber yes get her on the phone what are you doing here objection almost nine minutes causing brain damage to get her heartbeat back frank galvin weve met before if i could accept the offer right now i would they took it back im going to win this case mist mr doneghy im going to the jury with a solid case a famous doctor as an expert witness and im going to win eight hundred thousand dollars i swear to you i wouldnt have turned the offer down unless i thought that i could win the case its all right mickey hold on a second its completely done on a contingency basis that means whatever the settlement is i retain onethird that is of course the usual arrangement i completely understand i doubt well have to go to trial i was telling your wife we have a very good case here please sit down i told your wife im sorry that we have to meet out here ive got a case coming in two days in the superior court and my office is a mess of papers no no thank you you go home yes i yes no no thank you doctor you go home no you did fine now dr towlers testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes in your opinion is his estimate correct in your opinion what happened to deborah ann kaye dr thompson from your review of the hospital records of may twelfth nineteen seventysix these people play very rough they dont want to lose this case theres a lot of pressure they can bring to bear i apartment no no please you dont know who were dealing with i please believe me they yes yes i think so i hope youll be comfortable im putting you up at my im going to take you to the home to see the girl i have some errands to run and then i thought wed spend the evening dr thompson thank you if she had eaten say one hour prior to admission the inducement of a general anesthetic the type you gave her would have been negligent page 414 if a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask is that what happened to deborah ann kaye she aspirated into her mask and you wrote that practice and methodology in anaesthesia general textbook on the subject is that correct dr towler page 406

brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes why did it take that long to get her heartbeat what happened in those three minutes what happened in those three they start again three minutes earlier fourandonehalf minutes after her heart stopped and they resume seven minutes but those notations stop fourandonehalf minutes after deborah ann kayes of the procedures there are notations every thirty seconds you have a record of what happened in the operating room dr towlerto do right isnt that why youre doing it thats perfectly all right i understand what are they going to do not invite me to their birthday party look i got ta go i have to be in cambridge whose side are you arguing i thought that you wanted to do something i dont have any interest

to do that right who called deborah ann kaye i read the hospital report on your client thats perfectly all right im kind of rushed do you mind if we walk while we talk yes galvin rightim going to uphold that the document is disallowed the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of kathy costello regarding the xerox form its unsubstantiated and we cant accept a copy in preference to the original one moment mr concannon you may step down ill rule on that presently proceed mr galvin rebuttal mr concannon huh the doctors were not negligent then youre saying theres no negligence based on my question are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice noted thank you miss costello was a rebuttal witness her sole rebuttal was the document which has been disallowed overruled mr concannon you arent going to get a mistrial boy were going back this afternoon were going to try this case to an end now you get out of here before i call the bailiff and have you thrown in jail are you done galvin look many years ago listen to me fella i got a letter from the judge advocates office on you today fella youre on your way out they should have kicked you out on that lillibridge case now this is it today id just like to get to the point mr galvin lets not waste these peoples time answer the question mr witness please would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence yes mr galvin i believe thats the law is it not mr galvin sustained yes the witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records do we have time this morning to all right mr galvin you want to continue now or we can resume with dr thompson this afternoon defense is the plaintiff ready i dont have a week this case never should have come to trial you know better youre mr independent you want to be independent be independent now ive got no sympathy for you that happens you should have taken their

first no youll find im full of surprisesno there is another told you i did reckless is he now things are going to worse strong is vader clouded is your fate mind what you have learned notice everything everything it can save you stopped they must be do you hear on this all depends will he finish what he begins hes too old yes too old to start the training this one i have watched a long time all his life has he looked away to the horizon to the sky to the future never his mind on where he was on what he was doing adventure excitement a jedi craves not these things much anger in him like in his father if it must be yes yes yes to obiwan you listen young one the tree remember your failure at the tree heh foreknowledge is helpful but painful sometimes and dangerous too you have far to go in your training difficult to see always in motion is the future back away little machine it is the future you see bespin i see it too friends you have there heh concentrate and see them you will control control you must learn of what you see not easy not fast free your mind and return he will only what you take with you this tree is strong with the dark side of the force a servant of evil it is into it you must go four this time the force you feel no nothing more will i tell you now clear your mind of questions quiet now be at peace you will know when you are at peace calm passive a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense never for attack no no easier quicker more seductive the dark side beckons but if once start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it will as it did obiwans apprentice anger fear aggression the dark side of the force are they easily they flow quick to join you in a fight beware beware beware of them a heavy price is paid for the power they bring no no this will not do anger is what you feel that would matter not were the force flowing through you higher youd jump faster youd move open yourself to the force you must that they are concentration heh concentration that is why you fail size has no meaning it matters not look at me judge me by my size do you no try not do do or do not there is no try no no different the differences are in your mind throw them out no longer of use are they to you yes but by what standard ask i forget your old measures unlearn heh unlearn it would be in seven pieces were you a jedi you will be my young one heh you will be you are reckless to become a jedi takes the deepest commitment the most serious mind ready are you what know you of ready i have trained jedi for

control program no no im sure but you understand it should only be a couple of days whats the thing youre working on we have to close that down just briefly security reasons someone with that access has been tampering oh you have group 7 access dont you oh yes the algorithms on cloud seedinggreat piece of work hows it going come on in you wouldnt dare if you think what do you want with the pentagon now wait a minute i wrote you the pentagon its my fault i programmed you to want so much im sorry cute i think wed better shut off all access till we can find that file just to be safe meanwhile he might find it hes still looking for that old file cant you just appropriate it flynn no problem masterc if youve seen one consumer electronics show whats up im sorry walt so much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink it can be arranged doing our business is what computers are for look walter with all respect icom isnt the business you started in your garage anymore the mcp is the most efficient way of handling what we do i cant sit and worry about every little user request that walter i sympathize but i have data coming out of the master control program saying there is something screwy nahi decidedive had enough of video games to last me a good long time i feel like gettin into some real life and dillingers instructions to divert them its all there look even his home phone number when he logged on i know i met him want one my dinner hi alan boy if we were inside i know how to forge us a group 6 access yeah tryin to find the file and erase it once thats gone aint nothin can stop him just eddie and his master control program runnin things from on high because somewhere in one of those memories is the evidence if i got in far enough i could reconstruct it oh my meanwhile kids are putting eight million quarters a week in space paranoids machines and im not seeing one dime yepper and vice squad and meltdown whole slew of em i was this close to starting my own little enterprise but enter ed dillinger another software engineer not so young not so bright but very very sneaky one night our boy flynn goes to his terminal tries to read up his file and nothing a big blank we now take you to three months later ed dillinger presents icom with five video games he has invented the slime didnt even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion thus begins his meteoric rise towhat is he now executive vp sherman set the wayback machine foroh 1973 kevin flynn is one of the brightest young software engineers at icom hes so bright that he starts going in there at night and sets up a private memory file and begins writing a program for a video game he is inventing called space paranoids you havent told him embezzling is such an ugly word mister bailey no actually im trying to get a legal brief together tried to cant quite make the connection with that sucker though if i had a direct terminal lets get outta here so nice ship you got here whats our next move this towns full o live ones this honey doesnt handle so good in town way to go were haulin another mouth to feed you dont by any chance know how to drive this crate im your program wheres your program wont it miss you only yes and no youre a bit oh anything else that all you can say what do you mean yes aah im fine little hung over is all hey you guys ok did we make it not us i hope what about our friend sark all right thank god alan stayed awake at least i hate to disappoint you pal mostthe time thats how it is for users too look you guys know how it is you just keep doin what it looks like youre supposed to even if it seems crazy and you hope to hell your user knows whats goin on you wish man i havent had a second to think since i got down here i mean in here out here whatever its time i levelled with you tron im a well im what you guys call a user no big deal i ought to know my way around that light cycles routine i mean i did write the program for it im sorry tron hes he didnt make it yeah i oops greetings program how about over therethat empty memory whats that you know anybody thats got an army for rent thats finebut my uh user said to go take that sucker out an lets face it the big ox isnt gon na get any weaker i feel like hittin him now while im good an mad some nerve what does he care whether you guys get killed long as he keeps rakin in quarters i uh im a program from a user that knows alan well isnt it alan shhhhh probably jump yori steer us over the beam right next to it lets get some power here elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh my head are we there yet mommy theres another beam lousy utility companies theyre the same wherever you go whats wrong with that area boy the view from up here you know the territory guess i took a wrong turn somewhere hey damn never fails minute the warranty runs out are you kidding i think its stealing us whats goin on feel what you okay it grows on you wellmy home sector was called paramus its all circuits must be an inputoutput component watch it yeah but im remembering all kinds of stuff likemy user wants me to go after the mcp tron oh uhi dont remember too much yeah yeah thats great hey ram what were you you know before well great thats no sweat i play video games better than anybody lookjust so i can tell my friends what this dream was about okay

well i want to communicate i have come to communicate with my user how about you yes not with this disk im going to check on the beam connection yori you two can keep a watch out for grid bugs probably decided not to pursue us the sea of simulation is tricky lot of illusionsrough navigating programs have a way of just disappearing here were on our way alanone gave me the coding we need to go up against master stranger and stranger well thats how it is for programs yes but then but if youre a user then everything youve done has been part of a plan wrote the flynn wheres ram youre alive flynn no goodthey might block off the old chip this way tankscoming back lets go what just the three of us the name of my user yeah but how where did you hear that name i have to find out what alan wants that comes first we have to do it theyd better bei dont want to bust outta this dump an find nothin but a lot of cold circuits waitin for me another free program off line whats his user sposed to do wheres flynn nice we have to get off this beam what is it this is flynn the one who busted me out as long as it gets us out of here i had toin the games why is everythinglike this dont know yet i have to get in touch with alan he was going to tell me how to thats all going to change yori yori hey
