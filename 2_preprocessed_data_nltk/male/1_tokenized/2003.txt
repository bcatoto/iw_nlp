said were dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead you wont find them wont find west either hes too good i guess nunez wasnt dead after all he came after us with a vengeance you know the rest hunting we had to hunt him he he made me do it jesus oh you dont what else do you have on me you havent found any bodies yet have you you wan na bet mr hardy i joined the army for college money i didnt ask for any of this i tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed you say finding those bodiesll help me then go find them i dont want to die but not pikes they would have killed us both you want me to write a confession ill write a confession yeah of course i apologize i didnt shoot west did kendall tell you about the px im serious hes lying that son of a bitch this is one of those interrogation tricks isnt it you dont give me a cigarette till i tell you more yeah and thats all im saying some im not telling you what happened okay theres no need you did basic here i dont know i like the army i just dont like it its too slow i asked for a policeman just a guess maybe theyre not where theyre supposed to be maybe somebody moved them habeas corpus no bodies no crime and nunez still plays as self defense face it detectives you have nothing ohhhh i dont think so did i ever claim i was raymond dunbar was i ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record no you assumed who i was because i was wearing this uniform dont believe me is that what i did now and of course you can prove all of it cant do that now though can you dont know on a map west told us it was there we just found it maybe the hurricane took it away would you have believed me yeah one went off yeah but it didnt touch him i thought you knew this the creek bed pills shots you name it basics a lot easier when you dont feel pain no did he tell you about it about the business childs ran yeah spent half his time in the infirmary only reason he enlisted was his father west didnt section him till last week he was sickly had that shaking thing whatdyacall it epoxy there were six of us that first night with pike i made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300 no maam he just wanted us to quit making it through was kind of an honor some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack section eight command would consider you at the top of the class your weapons sergeant sir yes sir sir yes sir sir dunbar sir so you killed him so did we why didnt you come west hes dead we were each given three so whoever killed west will be missing one shut up let me see your grenades i hated west childs hated west everyone with a goddamn brain hated west but that doesnt mean we killed him he wouldnt kill anybody put it down no no we can just wait till we get back and then tell the mps this is a lot of information to be getting i have to think i i dont know they his chest was hamburger full clip to the body that still doesnt mean you didnt kill him why why didnt you tell me youre lying why bullshit you hated west mueller loved him thats exactly what he says about you oh come on if not you then who youre the only one missing a grenade you hated west more than any of us yeah you know its not like that we just want to check your pack where have you been jay what do you mean wests whose blood is that jayold friend havent talked to him in 911 can i use your phone bill styles yeah and i couldve used the sleep im supposed to meet people here tonight try and get some work going dont you mean dont need no liquor license not taken away from me yeah if youve slept can i at least have a drink you know that was like a quadruple negative hes telling the truth up to a point i promised them id ask you where west and the others are and the bodies do what not true cadet ive got a gun weve found all of them we dont need the tapes were not finished yet raymond for you to have any chance of coming out of this we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony otherwise this is just another story you saved kendalls life you shot childs and nunez and hed been shot you saw wests body yeah we know pike did so childs made some side money so what people are dead ray and the only one we have to blame is you fuck youre serious raymond you got exactly zero truck with us right now wed take the word of a crackhead over yours so if youve got something to say say it well why didnt you say so well just drop all your charges then thatd be my reaction too hey ray just had a nice talk with your buddy kendall seems you killed three people no actually i just left mine in the car and was hoping you had some you smoke ray and those were the guys who went on the exercise with you tell me about them okay but i would like to know about the other cadets what they were like nice guys whyd you ask for a cop ray right now im gon na go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more okay theyre dead arent they fifteen years ago under sergeant west piece of work that guy i remember he used to have these two silver 45s with ivory handles and if you werent quick enough hed knock you on the head with one of them he still carry those guns cmon ray everyone hates the army during basic ill tell you straight i hated it here what do you like then well its a game of anticipation thats the beauty youre under military arrest its not gon na happen whats wrong with baseball why not maybe what where are they you lied to us levi youre going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them but you cant prove it you cant prove anything until we find the bodies or you levi when is it finally going to come out that you were the one who killed him how do you know why jail if hes lucky the gas chamber if hes not something funny levi dunbar will testify that you were well huh you know i really thought you said nunez i thought you said dunbar was gone my fault i got ta check the tape on that oh yeah we taped the last interview this one too cause itd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie dunbar was running out the door ohhhhhh see thats where i was confused because i thought you said nunez was running out the door why did you tell us he shot everybody levi you put him in for three murders the man saved your life is it the truth my heart weeps can i go to jail for punching a guy whos been shot you tried to pin three stone murders on dunbar stop okay i think thats it he rises and walks to the door why did he come back for you he admitted it but you didnt then who did what happened to degrees levi i dont know if youre familiar with investigative work but we have this little thing called motive and you just gave yourself one i think you just blew dont ask dont tell out of the fucking water senator daddy must be thrilled but not the only victim right levi you got about four hours before armed men show up here put you on a plane to washington and lock you in a very small dark room i suggest you talk to us coast guard special detective detail we feel this incident may have put the beaches of florida at risk get your hands away from the desk you cant duck this bill i may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but i wont let this happen no more witnesses wests a ghost but it doesnt matter because we have your signature the hospital log and kendalls toxicology report and thatll be enough not for long no you will stand there and you will listen what happened to you bill you were the one who joined up to do good in the world you were the one who believed in it you poisoned him bill you heard our interrogation you knew he was ready to crack so you killed him just like pike toxicology report came back kendalls attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine maybe youve heard of it its for asthmatics if an epileptic takes enough it kills them i checked with the nurses at the hospital youre the only other person who visited kendall what i cant understand is why you signed these if youd just let west take care of the paperwork no one would have known but you got careless so when pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him too west had a partner someone who knew how to get things done stay where you are im not going to cover for you bill not for this if you let him testify then it would have all come out west was supposed to take care of it out there shut nunez up and then disappear but it got messy and people got killed so you called your old pal tom hardy figuring if worse came to worse hed cover for you it was so good i actually forgot youre one of the bigger dogs now the base commander the one in control you couldnt let him testify could you youre a good soldier bill im sorry bill theyre taking your command arent they i wouldnt know where to start i guess it was about one man framing another he thought if the other guy got blamed people would over look his own wrong doings thats horseshit and you know it yeah what i said before im talking about west we had him bill we were there youre the fucking base commander you knew what he did to cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has you want a confession why dont you confess bill people are dead and you dont give a shit about it only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job you know this is your fault home im done you mean not enough to save you nevertheless what kendall will testify and thatll be enough from dunbar i hate to break this to you but i dont think hes gon na be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty okay then lets widen the search to include the endzone in giants stadium and the trunk of my car there was a hurricane bill the wind probably moved it someone must have got a shot off he wasnt exactly a moving target pike killed west dunbar killed mueller childs and nunez hes not done by a longshot i can get more out of him im not gon na let that happen and im the closest thing to it right which gives us about five hours whyd you call me im assuming thats what made him the dead one and the problem is you only got three well hes a good soldier its not west is it tell me its not west and here you are going out of house hows that make you feel jules tell me what i can do that bad what kind of trouble are you in how are you yeah but he was a lot of other things too thanks in case you need me to testify about the shooting theyll clear you i should probably write that down want company think itll work leaving without saying goodbye what are you gon na do do i have a choice in this west really there are degrees of truth officer always degrees tough this is the perfect time you know what makes a good detective the number of confessions they get youre a good detective osborne so now you get mine seven guys what was it you said you were just starting to believe i wasnt the guy people said seven no death certificates no crime wheres wests body we can tie you to the chair if itll work better for you isnt this how your story goes right back where we started get in good just making sure maybe maybe we were nowhere near sometimes mysteries stay mysteries i havent by any chance grown on you have i thats gon na stay my secret it dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority and all i did here was follow orders it didnt add up plus i got kicked out nah now i go home get drunk and try and forget this ever happened yeah no i didnt i wanted to humiliate him for what he did to dunbar for fucking over the little guy yeah i couldve shouldve i pushed him too hard thats a fantastic idea why dont you talk to levi off the record for a second are you sure what were fucked i know lets go talk to bill that bugs you too and all hell breaks loose a lot of good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz bang zoom happy ending kendall maybe would have agreed but the hurricane buttfucks the cabin and if theyre asked thats what theyll tell the world exactly someone whos not involved whos word cant be questioned you only let them see what you want them to see you make them believe so when the time comes theyve totally bought into your version of events and theyre smart about it they know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated you need a fall guy and for that to work you have to have a witness what happened next dunbar he said he didnt shoot west west wasnt shot kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and dunbar never saw the body i didnt shoot west why do you care oh spare me the reverse psychology bullshit this isnt my great second chance osborne everyone thinks im a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that nobody will ever know what happens here phenomenal at taking bribes right west was a monster fifteen years ago i was here i was section eight i was pike fuck being the knife dummy that thing he did stripping pike down making him stand outside all night he did that every year he did that to me fifteen years ago i wanted him dead and now im supposed to care that somebody offed him sorry no can do i tried watch me you knew what he was capable of and you just stood by it was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass and you know what he deserved it theres your confession why the fuck wasnt he in restraints well im sure if hed known this was all going to happen hed have tried harder to witness it for you everyones capable of murder osborne that means under a year let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me murder is basic there are no conspiracies no grand mysteries and no evil puppet masters behind it all pulling the strings murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people it doesnt always make sense but its always neat dunbars our guy too neat how long have you been an investigator i lied wait for it have no fear osborne we have not yet begun to fight got it being back here gives me the willies hes telling the truth up to a point you guys really got the shit kicked out of you here so noted i plan to grow on you the very same yeah thats just the story i tell the girls to get them into bed truth is i dont know the whole honor and duty thing make a difference in the world crap like that didnt really work out i lost a bet you had a mobile of bayonets above your crib microrecorder for kendall didnt have time to wire his room now tell me why you joined the army or ill jab this pen through your neck best time for banal chitchat youre right we should sit in silence oh im sorry i didnt know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good everyone knows good cop bad cop by admitting it i appeared trustworthy i believe somebody owes me ten dollars see ray this is what we call good cop bad cop she shouts i stand up for you youre grateful a bond of trust is established ten bucks says i have him talking in under three minutes something like that thank you at some point in there im gon na rub my nose when i do go at him with everything you got is he handsome self assured carry himself well does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor does he have good bones suggesting good breeding does he slouch or sit up straight these are important questions as they reveal a great deal about this mans character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute is dunbar cute because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms which doesnt exactly put people at ease is he cute move him hes in interrogation christ remind me to thank bill for mentioning that on the phone levi who names their kid levi three things first you dont have a choice second ive never taken a bribe in my life and third im still a little drunk from last night so if i skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you try not to take offense tell me about the two guys subtlety really isnt one of you finer points is it osborne it was for suspicion of bribery its really all in the wording he got me through basic and a lot of other stuff i owe him got ta be honest i love what youve done with the place and you notice im not in the army anymore i didnt mean that as a compliment he was our drill here mans older than sand ah christ fantastic you want to tell me whats going onyou framedhim maybe hes dead too maybe you killed them both mueller what about pike did did you i dont want to go what do we do i thought i was gon na have an attack go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou childs could tell i wasnt right im im sorry maybe he maybe i dont know i didnt because i was standing next to him because of what i saw who really killed west i didnt do anything i was just thinking of whats going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you then well leave it up to the courts his word against mine what does his father do again steelworker doesnt matter im sure justice will be served in any case my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions these accusations on his son hes quite protective sorry to disappoint im on painkillers for the injury they cloud the mind youre right it was nunez any more questions i believe your next line is what are you trying to hide no i said dunbar so i should stay silent about his misdeeds the guns went off i ran in childs shot me pike and mueller were dead and dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun theres that word again as i told you i wasnt in the room when everyone started shooting epileptic attacks are murder on your system rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer how many murders did you cover up one five maybe an even ten somebody emptied a full clip into him mr hardy i honestly dont know maybe to have someone to cover for him and i wish i could but theres no doubt in my mind he killed those men right in front of us mueller went after him but we held him back no poetic justice though maybe i shouldnt tell you that maybe i should tell you i wasnt scared at all but i was enough to almost kill him i didnt kill him you said you wanted to know what happened im telling you the truth the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled my father interceded so instead west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay he is not shall we say wild about the idea he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities and i have done my best to oblige him however in the last four weeks i began a relationship with another cadet what do you think of that my father is a powerful man over the years hes used that power to protect me in one form or another from certain unpleasantries i am a homosexual my my my how did things turn so hostile so quickly if i didnt know better id say you two were out to get me ive done nothing wrong im the victim here thats it youre that policeman with friends in low places tell me hows guissepe torres doing these days those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer you ive seen you around the base but you youre not army are you pike please i dont think i want to hear this how what are you talking about so you took off your shirt oh you remember now yeah and he doesnt know when poor fucker my ass we should tell him were not going you ever been in a hurricane mueller maybe we shouldnt go he came after us and i told dunbar he had to kill him i scared dunbar into silence hes been trying to cover for me the whole time we got here you came to see me i didnt know if i could trust him with that kind of secret i told him what had really happened to west told him to keep quiet about it or id destroy him because if it came out that i was involved with the whole px scam my father would be finished childs we did get our stories straight but not because we killed anyone it was because i threatened him dunbars telling the truth wait it wont work what you cant threaten me then hes mistaken you know i really dont think my father would approve of this line of questioning no but it got you interested didnt it got you to dig inspired ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didnt belong not much time to solve the crime tell me detective how did it feel taking blood money from guissepe torres did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it running out of time are we tick tock ticktock how long till your witnesses fly the coop weve been making progress i see like i said i was in the kitchen when i came out mueller and pike were dead nunez and childs were hit and dunbar was gone because hed shot mueller he whispered it in my ear youre gon na die tonight faggot clear as day he wanted more than that what the truth please there are degrees of truth officer always degrees things are not what they seema test will no doubt link you to the killing we wait and im a dead man i got a black face a criminal record and over a hundred other cadets wholl testify how much i hated west my court martial will take six minutes its either me or them ray and you got ta decide right now theres no time to think ray we got ta get out of here you untie me we grab the guns get kendall and nunez and make a run for it what dont you know mueller and childs one of them mustve taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper way i figure it west must have found out about their little business and was gon na bust them so they decided to get rid of him first thats close range you go full auto on a guy from close range youre gon na be swimming in blood look at my uniform nothing from up close or far away you saw west right how was he killed becoming a morphine addict during basic aint exactly something you want to broadcast only mueller and childs know pull up my sleeve right arm combat grade morphine mueller sold it to me just look little pocket look in my pack enough to go to prison childs px scam mueller was in on it who you gon na trust ray him or your friend were sweeping our area and suddenly hes gone couple minutes later phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away mueller ray this is my life here i aint gon na pretend im not happy west is gone but you know i couldnt have done this its not in me which anyone coulda taken out of my gear on the chopper were you watching your pack on the ride in maybe but that dont make me a killer you got ta untie me i didnt do this thing ray right do i why roberto what the fuck wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place its gettin bad out there wheres west i mean i killed him isnt that what we all wanted wests any kindling for afire although that wont matter much when coupled with the murder charge someone else can do the deed it doesnt have to be you maybe nunez too hes got a tendency to follow mueller but the rest of us can come out ahead the guys who took out their sergeants killers well move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged west all we got ta do is tell the story right mueller hes as bad as west and we both know it now i cant do it cause im tied up but we get the others to go along a gay senators son who let his sarge get fragged on a training exercise the pressll crucify you and your father his career will be over and itll be your fault but we do this different and you come out a hero the thing is weve got a real opportunity here you turn me in tomorrow and were both fucked failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself until we return to base and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in sergeant wests body you are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard cadet michael mueller i hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of sergeant nathan west goddammit ray we got ta get out of here still got mine on not a speck of blood on it not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours wheres your shirt mueller this place is going mueller we got ta move thank god blame the nigger then huh someone turns up dead you just look for the darkest face in the crowd what the fuck happened to you hurricanes due after midnight and were still going outfor the last time i have no idea what youre talking about youre crazy you want to get into a finger pointing contest about character the army kicked you out for drugs the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct theres only one criminal standing in this room and its you im not even going to dignify that i wanted to see if he was okay thats preposterous or what youve gone round the bend youre drunk what are you talking about i thought you said that wasnt a compliment dont be im not cut out to deal with the wests of the world the senator you think you could explain all this to me maybe but its my fault and ill carry it its over time of death was 442 jags been notified and i called the senator myself my report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable you two had no culpability in the matter does osborne agree was dead right you think dunbars on the level what the hell are you talking about what about the confession tom where are you going jag gets here in three hours try for the confession not for me nevertheless without the body we have no physical proof we need a confession habeas corpus you have to have a body to have a crime weve already been over the terrain twice nothing who killed pike he can wait kendalls out of surgery tom bottom line i let those kids go out there if jag shows up and i dont have any answers for them my career is finished the guy in interrogation said hed only talk to a cop cadet roberto r nunez killed right in front of me no the problem is ones dead ones got a bullet in his arm and one wont talk the one who wont talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pickup the exercise was one of his section eight private sessions left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning a few years ago the army picked our good buddy as their go to noncom to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder gentler military he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country the official term for it is clusterfuck by the time beth hit us id canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush were missing three and the sergeant the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle nobody here knows much about them up to and including their names but the sergeant this is warrant officer julia osborne the closest thing we have to an in house investigator would i have called you if it wasnt if there was any other way been better i read about whats been happening with you i should have called the army kicked you out for drugs gets on his plane in ten minutes which means you two are done youll understand if i dont walk you out im giving you a chance to walk away you both know if you do this if you go after a senators son and youre wrong its not just me in the hot seat anymore you want kendall dont you what do you think you think he did it i called the jag corps the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to dc on a transport leaving here at 1700 then its unofficial hes former army and the best ive ever seen in a room besides he knows the territory we did basic together here youve had three hours with dunbar and havent gotten a peep we need to take a different tack he asked to see a policeman were getting

theyll tell a story straight through and it wont be complicated but it wont be interesting either there was one time when i was eleven truth is ive been thirsty my whole life never really known why well we were all set to but there was a complication well its not a short one will never told you that probably just as well he would have told it all wrong anyway all the facts and none of the flavor thats because we didnt have a wedding your motherinlaw was never supposed to marry me she was engaged to somebody else you dont need a picture just look up handsome in the dictionary spooning the sherbet they were squeezing the cheese clanking the bottles licking the popsicle he was buttering her rolls pumping her churn splashing milk in her box he was slipping her a little extra cream because see my mother was banging the milkman terrible for her but think about me young boy with that kind of power wasnt three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said your grampa is going to die well i ran right back to my parents my father said no gramps is fine but i could see there was trepidation and true enough that next morning my grampa was dead means when you dream about something thats going to happen like one night i had a dream where this crow came and told me your aunt is going to die i was so scared i woke up my parents they told me it was just a dream to go back to bed but the next morning my aunt stacy was dead i was dreaming youre lucky to get four words out of them in english but if you were to walk through the jungle youd hear them speaking the most elaborate french those parrots talk about everything politics movies fashion everything but religion just to be sure you can take my pack that poet norther winslow did he was going to paris france he must have liked it because no one ever heard from him again tell you what you take the other way and ill cut through here meet you on the far side beats me okay i love every square inch of it but i can feel the edges closing in on me a mans life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this so what do you say join me mines edward and truthfully i do want you to leave karl but i want to leave with you you think this town is too small for you well its too small for a man of my ambition i cant see staying here a day longer whats your name giant so why are you wasting your time in a

have a kid of my own here it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me only on the surface but thats all ive ever seen you tell lies dad you tell amusing lies stories are what you tell a fiveyear old at bedtime theyre not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty and the thing is i believed you i believed your stories so much longer than i should have and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible everything i felt like such a fool to have trusted you you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined just as charming and just as fake i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact the thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them the other 90 percent is below the water where you cant see it and thats what it is with you dad im only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water im trying to make a metaphor here dad do you know much about icebergs dad can we talk dad the maple tree and the buick we heard it yes josephine actually went to the congo last year why not religion dad i thought you werent dying i used to do it when you were gone remember i used to do it a lot i will id just like to know the true versions of things events stories you dad im hoping we can talk about some things while im here youre right when did you ever work in an office really what did he say okay so how does it happen no she was old and probably senile maybe schizophrenic the old lady by the swamp really you think im up for it did you do any of that am i im not scared the one about the witch no dad they dont i do not like the story not anymore not after a thousand times i know all the punchlines dad i can tell them as well as you can for one night one night in your entire life the universe does not revolve around edward bloom it revolves around me and my wife how can you not understand that friend of yours did you help him out of a bind i am a footnote in that story i am the context for your great adventure which never happened incidentally you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born make him stop you didnt become crazy logically you couldnt be the witch because she was old back when he was young my father talked about a lot of things he never did and im sure he did a lot of things he never talked about im just trying to reconcile the two because hes dying ive seen him with women he flirts he always has on some level i presumed he was cheating on my mother i just never had proof were you and my father having an affair how did you know my father are you jenny hill hello is he going to be okay what happened i need you on my side look i know why you like him i know why everyone likes him but i need you to tell me im not crazy what is true ive never heard my father say a single true thing you have to understand when i was growing up he was gone more than he was here and i started thinking maybe he has a second life somewhere else with another house another family he leaves us he goes to them or maybe there is no family maybe he never wanted a family but whatever it is maybe he likes that second life better and the reason he tells all those stories is because he cant stand this boring place everyone loves my father hes a very likeable guy mmm what i know better than to argue romance with a french woman mmm thats because most of it never happened they met at auburn did you you dont have to probably tonight its more than they thought theyre going to stop chemo mom do you want some time with dad ill stay why dont you go home with josephine and ill stay tonight so you never bought any land did you and dad have any other property mom is he awake that really happened no but its weird she seemed to recognize me mom do you know who that is blonde hair but i understand you mom i always have true but ive known him my whole life and i dont feel like i know him at all or ever will josephine and i have a lot in common yes but thats a different how is that possible i mean you try to ask him a question and suddenly its another one of his stories you cant honestly say you know him what i mean is do you really know whats going on in his head mom would you say you understand dad i dont know if youve seen it but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek how much time does he have left how is he is that dr bennetts car we rented a car we swam the atlantic its not that big reallyoh well thanks for the drink no no nothing like that i work in a bank well typically corporate loans are relatively simple matters but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery can silicon valley so what do you do my names grant grant ashby uh makers mark rocks tough day i wasnt sure if youd make it jake right uhhuh uhhuh yeah its going through ten percent of how much no i understand that what i mean what im trying to say i was actually wondering about well my cut lets just slow down for a second whats this i know it wont go unnoticed everything looks in order and you have this letter of intent sort of like a letter of intent bigcom that internet thing i dont follow banks need to know how theyre going to get their money back thats right and tech firms they tend to scare people off well typically speaking theyre not as long as you can demonstrate what do i do im the vp of finance i envy you guys taking a chance like thatso why dont you take a deep breath jake and ill count to ten one two three like putting on a play guess some people forgot their lines oh jake you disappoint me and you just let lily here down again what was it you said about playing the big con alright turn around she doesnt get shit unless i get that money where is it alrlght alrlght what happened today after you cut her loose yes it is jake yes it is they were right there for you she was right there for you look at her bullshit you were scared jake you lost your nerve you lost your confidence you werent being noble you werent trying to save anybody but yourself admit it so much for honor among thieves you would have cut loose your friends your girl is that what it was jake was it love she had you tempting fate like what youre a superstitious fucker nice cue the fucking violins come on its getting cold but there were other factors i can see why you liked her so howd you get caught in this case you might say i want to know how not to play the big con keep going i want to know how you got lionel dolby keeping the fix happy and these cops what do they get its all about the money isnt it grifters thats not a bad place to start your life flashing before your eyes things are probably going to end badly for you jake no im not the antichrist or the prince of darkness im just a guy looking for some answers know who i am jake ten is standard sir well take care of it so we go to the bar not that i recall what do you want us to do about itpoor bastard never knew what hit him jesus i almost felt sorry for the guy the red hair its bad luck people have tried this before jake its never worked teddy fraiser and his crew went on vacation in chicago for it last year mumps got pinched in la alright lets all put our dicks back in our pants for a second is this the best thing to do whoa what come on big al gets whacked midegg foo young the whole thing took about two and a half hours thats how good he is no that was the only semifucking smart thing he said except anybody thats ever met big al knows that the only thing hes comfortable doing alone is eating this guys tells this guy that guy tells some other guy eventually it works its way back to someone who works for the king and what are you new let me tell you how good this guy is last night al calls this bookie to settle up apparently hes been ducking him for like a month so the guy asks him where hes got all this money all of a sudden right what does al do does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking bar mitzvah bond does he tell him hes been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop no he starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some wall street assholetype how he fleeced independent same shit just independent they call him the king pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book big fat bald currently the king pin is a very largetype pole stuck up our asses the cash we fleeced off of him was collection money he was supposed to take that money and give it to the king earlier yesterday like he does every thursday cept this time he figured he could make a little something for himself off us and still get the kings money back before any body says boo jake i mean come on moonan here shit lets go jake jake masters of our own destiny you ever use the bathroom in kennedy id like this cashed please so thats it jake calls youll be there were going to make it back grant three or four times over you sure so then miles walks straight into the creative directors office and says the codes fine the programs for shit and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guys desk she up for this you laugh now but wait until you need a clean place to powder this is new york city sister public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda you know what you can get off a toilet or doorknob lets do the list hepatitis influenza the flesh eating disease yeah whatever jake hows that he works for gillette we only owe the king a hundred and fifty how much we going after you got ta be kidding me her when and what about big al it gets worse now i know why he was such a good rope i mean cash that much and we never had to put him on the send turns out this ducking moe was an accountant for the king pin seems lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night they just pulled him out of the east river i just dont know if this says me whats the fabric i guess i got ta drop a dime did anybody mess up the hoop thats a lot of cash he came up with it pretty quick but you wont get that splatter effect shitsame thing with playing a con you have to be able to see that deep two million the standard ten then there it is ashby gets the itch youre worried about recouping the loan i already told you you need some convincing consider it a convincer therell be red flags this has to happen fast we had to finalize the deal yes thats why i wish there were guys willing to take a chance and live a little exactly but the catch22 is that you cant tell anyone about the offer because if its public you could start a bidding war and thats considered a breach of etiquette it could kill a deal but wait too long and youre not considered hot anymore right the guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the valley do they get a good idea shop it around raise some capital then sell it off to a bigger company microsoft intel oracle whatever the beauty of it is theyve pretty much sold the company before theyre even real the bigger company is already set to buy it all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works so they get some start up capital make it work then sell it for like five times the initial loan listen what im about to tell you im telling you in confidence okay have you ever heard of a company called bigcom we know exactly how were going to make the money back there in lies the catch22 they scare people off because most people lack vision vision and balls present company excluded of course a capacity for gross fund recovery yeah we got that part maybe you can help us understand whats so hard about getting a corporate loan heres where a little research comes in handy corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars its a small lie but now were sure hes playing what do you do over at your bank grant uh right and that was it thats when we decided to start our own business no more shithead bosses it can erase all those things about you that you wish didnt exist what are you talking about you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do we got it down cold al you dont want to jinx it by changing something up do you gordo plays the inside youre the shill guess so its like putting on a play where everyone knows their part except for the mark probably safe in the hands of the federal government today started off great she walked we were back on its not true i was doing it for them you know when the first con was ever played it was when adam fell for eve in the garden of eden my father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy the same numbers everyday for sixteen years one day he gets pissed off tells them hes out and plays his own numbers they hit the lucky seven for one point two million having a gun pointed at you for one its not like breaking a mirror bad luck but its bad three on a match black cats believe it believe it all lucks a funny thing especially the bad back in wwi or wwii one of the wws if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match some nazi would be able to figure out where you were then well it was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had so three on a match is bad luck thanks did you know you shouldnt light three cigarettes with a match we got our stake now we need to find our guy in gilletts bank hes just as crooked as the next guy youd think hed have more important things to do with tax payer dollars factors that werent clear to me until now that was it we had our crew now we needed the mark suits used to say that in any con sooner or later someones going to start asking the right questions usually it takes a little longer so you want to know how to play the big con you never know when you can use a crooked cop im not saying anything besides youre one to talk youre the one whos got me on my knees in a dark alley isnt it always we cant all be model citizens such as yourself just the last three weeks gee what makes

you already scared him half to death he didnt know who he was fucking withhah ten years you carried that pistol and you end up wasting your shot quite boy or youll lose your tongue those as know me know i wouldnt cross my word and bring down bad luck on the ship i agreed to set them free i didnt when nor where eh you have my word then on the good book i do swear and the lord spare my worthless soul we got that part anything else enough of that name your terms youve got one shot and we cant die whats in your head boy so what now jack sparrow are we to be two immortals locked in epic battle until the trumpets of judgement day just so you know jack i dont think youre that clever i think youre a fool a mortal fool aye for us there is men are you up for it that so i cant help wondering jack why youre being so helpful and all last time you did that it didnt end well for you whatre you suggesting why dont i want to do this no i really think i do thats fair so how did you get off that island anyway youd best take a swim jack now jack that reef is less than a league distant its a square deal all around and you cant hope for better bosun set up mr sparrows quarters nice and fine in the brig meaning no disrespect of course that fool woman took it you be careful around her jack shes pretty enough shell steal your heart but pure evil inside youre playing this as close to the edge as any man ill give you that we might just have to sign articles you and i jack youre a pirate at heart thats certain jack i dont trust you and thats a fact never trust a smiling man you can lay to that track you down and youre setting me up for a double cross you with the ship and me with nothing more than your word blast you ill throw you in prison ill torture it out of you im supposed to trust you thats your offer you sailing away nice and pretty with the black pearl and all i have is a name the pearl oh thats fine and just how do you expect this to work allow me the humor of listening to your terms say the name or i slit your throat no but him i believe he us genuinely angry turner blood doesnt flow pure in his veins best play it safe and spill it all by the powers youre right wheres jacks pistol whos got it bring it forward looks like your back to having nothing to offer now no dont kill him agreed you have my word as a gentleman of fortune aye and not a bit of it any use to us only hoarded but it will drive us no longer its a piece of the treasure of isla de muerta do you not know what this is then would that i could oh there would be no sense in killing you miss turner now none of that please dig in maid or not it fits you its you who invoked the parlay believe me miss youd best hand it over now or these be the last friendly words youll hear no no nothing like that very well you hand that over well put your town to our rudder and neer return and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that a family heirloom perhaps youve got sand for a maid you have a name missy did you now my holds are bursting with swag that bit of shine matters to me why i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request means no there was a lot of long words in there miss and were not but humble pirates what is it you want my apologies miss as you were saying before you were so rudely interruptedmr gibbs organize a cleaning detail you and cotton i want every inch of the pearl spicand span and shipshape anamaria trim the mainsail theyll be anchored on the lee side haul your wind and keep to the weather of the island youll get it back or one better safe at port royal with the royal navy anamaria have you seen gibbs i need to put together or you could surrender remarkable how often those two traits coincide theres another exit now you can take care of the dauntless right aye see after youre done with the royal navy youll have a bit of a problem the hms dauntless there youll be with two lovely ships on your hands and what to do of course youll decide you deserve the bigger one and whos to argue the dauntless a first rate shipofline and with it you can rule the seas but if youre captain of the dauntless whos left for the black pearl the situation has changed like after youve killed every last one of norringtons men youve no hope of surviving norringtons attack that is if youre mortal because right about now the hms dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor all right then you can go to your grave not knowing the last time you do this you left me a pistol with one shot someone needs to cut these bonds then its pure evil to make a captain walk the plank of his own ship twice in one lifetime no good can come of it ill watch my back what you dont have the medallion see thats where were different i trust you to do what it takes to get what you want lets say i tell you the wrong person what would you do wait as long as you like you left me on a desert island what worse can you do you see ive got this honest streak in me in its own way a sort of curse oh and theres the fact that you have no choice thats right you give me the pearl then i tell you who you need simple i have something you wont more than anything the way to free you from the curse of the treasure you have something i want more than anything no you wont i know whose blood you need to end the curse i have a plan if it succeeds then any battle will be decidedly brief and onesided exactly nor did you i noticed you you burned up the island for a onetime chance at being spotted why what are you doing youve burned our food the shade the rum to the black pearl weve got a few bottles left and weve yet to tap the kegs ah well the company is better than last time and the scenery has definitely improved when i get the black pearl back im going to teach it to the whole crew and well sing it all the time more to drink now i must hear this song an authentic pirate song have at it i know a lot of songs about pirates but none id teach a child lets hear it what what was that something funny miss swann share please dont be thinking im happy about this elizabeth but i see no use in wailing and gnashing my teeth over that which i can do nothing about youre right heres luck to you will turner you should look at our contretemps this way weve got shade trees thank the lord weve got some food on the trees thank the lord again and weve got rum praise the lord we can stay alive a month maybe more keep a weather eye open for passing ships and our chances are fair welcome to the caribbean love last time i was here a grand total of three days last time the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by and i bartered passage off but from the looks of this theyve been out of business and so that wont be happening again we probably have your friend norrington to thank for that it wont it wont and so we wont dont be thinking im not already working on it the trees are taller no this wont work ill stay behind and fight them you go on no im rescuing you me i saved your life now youve saved mine were square miss swann if youll be so kind ah thats a dark and unpleasant tale best left untold were catching up she can hold a bit longer that he is not if the fool has something barbossa wants something he needs aye and thats why i know where its going to be and thats why i know what barbossa is up to all i need is a crew im going after the black pearl i know where its going to be and im going to take it now where i wonder would they have gotten that idea first have you found me a crew well fortunately i know how to counter it the man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition as likely as not will short up the anchor weve got ourselves a ship fine by me we brought you a nice little boat so you can all get back to shore safe and sound well see about that dead serious none very well you rumbled me i confess i intend to commandeer one of these ships pick up a crew in tortuga and go on the account do a little honest pirating smith that so ive heard of one supposed to be fast neigh uncatchable the black pearl thats a fine goal im sure but it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here just a wee superflous this must be some important boat some sort of todo up at the fort eh you two werent invited sorry i didnt know ill slip in talk them into to come out and youll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them that chart i drew upll get you past the reefs if youre steersmans good enough that is i knew youd listen to reason they left me stranded twice what have you got to lose funny i was thinking along those lines how about you let me go in alone and while youre setting up an ambush ill trick the pirates out to you norrington think about it the black pearl its captain and crew the last pirate threat in the caribbean how can you pass that up we had time to get to know each other but it seems to be enough to condemn him ah but you have heard of me captain jack sparrow if you please the worst on the other hand maybe im a man who cant pass up a chance for revenge against the blackhearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean twice and who knows how to get what he wants now thats a great pirate and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves its the right way dont talk these caves magnify sound just follow me do you have any idea where youre going will dont do anything stupid dont say anything stupid im sure when youve led the kind of life that i have there are debts that must be paid maybe i can balance the scales a little go to the opposite end of the island and signal the ship ill keep em busy ill lead them away this way on whether the stories are all true if they are thats a waterfall that spills over at high tide with a short drop to an underground lagoon if not depends but i survived and i still have that single shot its meant for one man my mutinous first mate the pistol when a pirate is marooned will hes given a pistol with a single shot no good for hunting or surviving really but after three weeks of starvation and thrist the option of that pistol begins to look good these are the only ones worth having and were going to need them dont worry ive already got a quartermaster there oh did i forget to mention that then thats not much incentive for me to fight fair is it put it away will its not worth getting beat again sure because he could always go pirating you think your father is the only man who ever lived the glasgow life telling folk one thing and then going off to do another theres quite a few who come here hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life and theyre all merchant marines figured you wouldnt want to hear it i swear you look just like him good man good pirate and clever i never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him when you were puzzling out that cell door it was like seeing his twin i knew him probably one of the few he knew him as william turner most everyone just called him bill or bootstrap bill is that so for a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats youre a quick study everybody stay calm were taking over the ship remarkable how often those two traits coincide sos breaking a man out of jail face it will you may say youll never be a pirate but youre off to a riproaring start my advice smile and enjoy it commandeer were going to commandeer a ship nautical term no worries there shes far more likely to rot out from under us come aboard good my business will as for your business one question or theres no use going this girl what does she mean to you how far are you willing to go to save her not without my effects agreed how the keys run off so it is that you found a girl well if youre intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart youll have to do it alone i see no profit in it for me and you want to turn pirate yourself why ask me surely youve heard the stories the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de mureta an island that can not be found except by those who already know where it is somewhat move move away pirate you need to find yourself a girl or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is youve found one but cant get her who makes all these only a little do you think this is wise boy crossing blades with a pirate ah then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record so if youll excuse me you look familiar have i ever threatened you beforehe didnt waste it no you gave your word you must swear by the holy bible and jack and the crew free and unharmed if you agree then i will remain with you elizabeth goes free you cant i can she goes free but that was not a proper kiss elizabeth i think it doesnt matter that we are of a different class i cant believe he would make such a sacrifice for us if i had known why would my father send this to me im glad we got here in time at least once more miss swann as always i could never forget it miss swann we can at least fight we might be able to kill a few were not going to just surrender how did he get off the island what he never told me that really so whats the story on the pistol how do we expect to find an island no one can find with a compass that doesnt work i know that was for the smell well youre the worst pirate ive ever heard of youre a man who can be trusted who can be counted on and who cant betray his friends what kind of pirate is that jack are you certain this is the right way jack my name is will turner the son of bootstrap bill turner his blood runs in my veins you need my blood and on my word i will pull this trigger and sink all the way down to davy jones locker are you sure jack this is not something you have to do no miss swann were here to rescue you its going badly on what whats that barbossa wait what about the pistol shut up before you lose them all just do it quickly tortuga you didnt beat me you ignored the rule of engagement in a fair fight id kill you my father was not a pirate my father did not think of my mother his family as a burden he was a merchant marine he was a respectable man who obeyed the law and followed the rules its not true my father was a pirate thats not true bootstrap my father william turner i worked passage from england as a cabin boy after my mother passed i came out here looking for my father aye avast this is either crazy or brilliant its still against the law were going to steal a ship that ship i havent set foot off dry land since i was twelve when the ship i was on exploded its been a sound policy id die for her why are brothering with that we need to go agreed i helped build these cells those are hookandring hinges the proper application of strength the doorll lift free just calls for the right lever and fulcrum i can get you out of here never they took miss swann because youre a pirate the ships real enough so its anchorage must be a real place where is it where does it make berth are you familiar with that ship the black pearl no i can not just step aside and let you escape no you cheated i do and i practice with them at least three hours a day you threatened miss swann ive made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirateswell you better get the money somehow six oclock and come alone if you dont well destroy the tapes dont bullshit me laurant i know about the van gogh ive got the tapes if you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what i say

send us to zammitos house the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing but they dont move a crime is going down and they dont move why because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us i cant even hear myself think you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs how stupid is that well you know not all algerians speak french its a matter of what school you went too me i never really algeria why who are you waiting for i really thought we had something special going i cant tell you what a disappointment youve turned out to be its three in the morning not much else to do i thought id listen to some of the tapes see whats so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe its not your fault no whos gon na see it there its okay it was a long time ago no i got it in prison i went in for three years when i came out she was married to my best friend happy i dont remember i was drunk you ask a lot of questions something like that

hear of jet lag when do we go thanksthats a risk im willing to take deep down youre good even jade fox couldnt corrupt you ive always wanted a disciple worthy of wudans secrets why should i you need practice i can teach you to fight with the green destiny but first you must learn to hold it in stillness real sharpness comes without effort then tell me where jade fox is like most things i am nothing its the same for this sword all of it is simply a state of mind wheres your master isnt it a bit too late to be out youve brought me the sword tell me who is your master my name is li mu bai the green destiny is mine jade fox cant be your master where did you learn that xuan piu move who are you why is the green destiny in your possession all right hurry i will hold on as long as i can then you have no use for the sword kneel what ive always wanted to teach you lets end this here stop it you dont deserve the green destiny ive already wasted my whole life i want to tell you with my last breath i have always loved you i would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you because of your love i will never be a lonely spirit my life is departing ive only one breath left shu lien my blood will soon reverse its flow its the same poison she used to kill my master there is no antidote jade fox drugged her how did you get here ill look around and catch up later were close to your headquarters go home and check in youre right but i dont know what to do i want to be with you just like this it gives me a sense of peace giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons full of corruption i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble your hand rough and callused from machete practice all this time ive never had the courage to touch it shu lien the things we touch have no permanence my master would say there is nothing we can hold on to in this world only by letting go can we truly possess what is real all right ill write you an introduction take it to wudan wait there for news from me shes out there but i doubt shell show herself well keep our eyes open sooner or later shell come for the girl just be patient with me shu lien i thought by giving away the sword i could escape the giang hu world but the cycle of bloodshed continues for her they might make an exception if not im afraid shell become a poisoned dragon thats not for her she should come to wudan and become a disciple she needs direction and training you did your job well but this girl i saw her last night true but i must borrow it for one last mission jade fox must die at its edge did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl i admit getting it back makes me realize how much id missed it well we had talked i dont know it was stolen until i got here thats not what i meant i dont care about the sword but your men are watching over yus compund have you questioned him yet it says jade fox is hiding at yus on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yus were you involved did you see who posted it so i shall avenge my masters death after all i didnt think shed dare come back to peking jade fox impossible what have you discovered sir te believes its a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu perhaps first i must visit my masters grave its been many years since jade fox murdered him i have yet to avenge his death and yet im thinking of quitting i must pray for his forgiveness its time for me to leave it behind too many men have died at its edge it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade i am he has always been our greatest protector perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me something i cant let go of you are leaving soon no i didnt feel the bliss of enlightenment instead i was surrounded by an endless sorrow i couldnt bear it i broke off my meditation i couldnt go on there was something pulling me back during my meditation training i came to a place of deep

weve learned a valuable lesson we wont ever forget ya know harry i think this whole experience has soured me on women and with that complete loser hes so modest probably embarrassed by all the attention how could she miss this this whole salute to collins was her idea roger that wilco yeah no more clicks and whistles now she speaks perfect english principal collins is a greater american than george washington will ever be harry are we gon na build this thing or not put a fork in me harry lets get started harry we found the real thing to be thankful for screw george washington a float she wants us to show the world what a great guy principal collins is we never thanked him for giving us our special needs class something about showing the world what principal collins has done that makes total sense the treasure chest was in his office which means principal collins is a pirate im surprised captain rob never mentioned him maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it put it on i have no idea its full of files and documents and tapes enough look what this cursed chest is doing to us it was a diamond and you swallowed it but i ate your moms pie i lugged it all over town how true but i still feel i deserve more than you do of this treasure i mean i found it me too this is my favorite part of the tape three words i did but you were all mad at me and wouldnt listen you thinking what im thinking he must be on his way to pee out a fire hes like the pope like were gon na snake a girl away from the pope now it makes total sense why she didnt want him to know we were in his office the other night that must be her boyfriends car no look d2 am not sorry no further questions you certainly did if you have to ask you dont know wow we built a whole float in one afternoon and now the reward hello he only invented money george washington a turd a raft nothing why whaddya hear by the way did captain rob mention how i beat the crap out of him this afternoon the answer is george jefferson no one knows harry would you like to share with the rest of us whats so funny oh telling inside jokes now are we thats it youre out of the cool crowd next time turks passing out wedgies you aint gettin one hey theres no reason to use that kind of language captain rob came back jessica and i are through i couldnt stand being with her knowing you liked her it wasnt worth our friendship oh and she also has a boyfriend did you hear what i said the treasure like on your map harry i found the treasure harry harry this is my fantasy i suggest you leave before i imagine something horrible so have you given him some yet now what are you staring at you ugly monkey dont snap at me like that youre lucky i dont punch you right in the face i bet you want your head scratched hey where did you come from you have beautiful eyes harry can you hear me okay i saw this in a movie once open the dining room window and follow my lead say what i say youre always your

so unattractive youve obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar italian loafers we reinvented ourselveswe think you should give up the magazine sell it let someone else run it whatever it takes we miss you we miss our son but that doesnt make you the boss of everything son we love our lives just the way they are ted we put a lot of love in our business i always wanted craftsman tools he even got me the limited edition buckeye colors of course dumpling its very nice of ted but we own a small family grocery store i will not have my boys arguing watch your tone mister you

they did do one great thing they gave us our boy they had a rough life your father was a bouncer your mother was well a twobit stripper there was no place for a baby son of course we are im getting so good at this the lesson being youre way ahead of me again grandpa was so strong back then working from the crack of dawn so proud of his peaches i remember spring break of my senior year seems like a lifetime ago we understand your disappointment teddy christy is a pretty sexy provocative voluptuous weuhwe understand your disappointmentfrom my wise albeit youthful vantage point the world is your oyster you scored big you ever look down on them again and call them grocers like its a dirty word and youll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks got it but just for the record my mom is a kickass schoolteacher and my dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the himalayas you seem to have forgotten they opened nelsons family market so they could build something permanent a legacy for us their kids look ted im cool with everything youve long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town youve always had an itch for the good life im happy for you this couldnt happen to a nicer guy i meant biologically funny you should say that my grandfather was a peach farmer you cant come back that is you can but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine aside from the fact that moms eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isnt broken things couldnt be better are you kidding mom and dad discover im gone and ill be doing hard time just a formality if you could just sign right there mom and dad said its yours they seem to think youre coming home better view more spacious new carpet its a nobrainer i came to ask permission to take custody of your room my new bike they say money cant buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile impressive this is bigger than our whole house she knew exactly where you were staying which you neglected to tell me your own brother you can call me jimmy again sheryl petersen said james sounds too pretentious mom dad meatloaf has come to represent all that ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in hes what youd call clinically bummedexcept the girl the only one that really mattered we wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty we wanted to showcase women throughout the world get them together and while youre at it ill take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads hell yes all hundred and seventeen of em i thought i loved her i feel like ive just been hit by a mack truck it better not be my aunt trudy sorry ginger got a little you know enthusiastic yeah hes probably been serving cocktails so to speak at the orgies give me those how would you like it if i did that to your mothers panties oh how inappropriate is that i feel like im entering a forbidden tomb its a lot to digest imagine how youd feel and some really fast cars our plane crashed in the grand canyon a big fiery explosion we never made it to la they needed dental records to identify us and this place this actually is heaven i get it now you and me were dead dont tell me another vision of incomparable beauty what is it now i better go dad so far away in xenia you kiss your mother with that mouth not ever never this isnt some 80s porno film you dip shit there are no wild sex orgies be cool fake it if you have to perv wait a second i thought we were hamburger guys cut it out before you break something maybe he got promoted well dad said astronomical nobody knows about your constant masturbation nobody knows about your mental retardation poor freud turning in his grave any time any day a man can completely reinvent himself i defy any and all limits i defy your hamburger theory of life and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents someday ill find out were you always this sick see did you see that i genuinely think she wants me i feel a vibe thats charlie my best friend hes into beef analogies partly because hes a butchers son and partly because well hes just into beef analogies what can i say hes also a photographer you and your pep talks god you are so hot come on i was hamburger you were porterhouse you expect me to think at a time like this there isnt a drop of blood in my brain you have changed since second grade i miss those days when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence that was code for i like you i remember the first time you

even imagine i paid off the mortgage i ordered that winnebago you always wanted now youre ashamed of me its okay you need me consider me your fairy godfather except without the fairy part no more mealy apples and bruised bananas ever for the rest of your lives finally some gratitude dad lets just say i can buy anything i want in the whole bookstore including the bookstore just say it dad not the pit i guess its better than having tribal patterns carved in my face like one of those national geographic specials with the topless chicks i guess we could go to disneyland or something yeah i guess well why should i they didnt want me when i was born why should i care you guys are my parents sometimes you have to do stuff you dont want to do its all part of growing up and it usually works out peachy in the end it was the year of the rhizopus rot grandpa almost lost the farm you sacrificed your dream to go to the prize hog festival and in the end you saved the peaches and you didnt have to slaughter your sow remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out i knew more than you dad please its my private business mine i guessi dont knowi guess we should leave if were not wanted hang in there ill think of something what do you want me to do of course we were whatever you want hmmm i always knew there was more i felt it what do you mean im ted

planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown the girls of xenia just to show my appreciation matter of fact jay my uncle and i are planning to rethink the magazine to expand the traditional western notions of beauty im no stranger to the notion of philanthropy andrew carnegie has long been one of my idols well jay theyve been exceptionally supportive great i didnt forget

been looking at naked girls in heaven since they were old enough to figure out their dads hide it under the mattress with all due respect to merk he doesnt have to read my magazine but he has no right to stop others ever hear of the first amendment i guess you wont be wanting that rolex i sent you then have you ever even looked at heaven are you kidding this magazine is my dream its every

been laughed right out of xenia i was like a different person tonight whoa butthats the thing ive never even actually me the king of coitus i do all those people out there its a lot of pressure truth

the bad news i can take for one day people pay good money for that i was in the middle of a melodramatic exit it wouldnt really make a statement if i tiptoed out the doorwhat are you sellingwe dont generally feature blowup dolls in our magazine but hey if you think theres a market for it if it isnt straight by now son you probably should see a doctor every one of these women thinks she should be the next angel of the month its your job ted to decide which of them is right never say never this is a fun placebut we dont usually come here until after the orgies aw come on kid throw me a bone im your uncle for gosh sakes all is fair in heaven tedbaby what are you doing i loved my brother i stood by his wishes to let his son run the company a son he never knew a son that he and his wife gave away at birth a son who was raised in a world quite different from our own nevertheless i was there for the lad i guided him as best i could but hes only seventeen with a mind of his own and judgment
