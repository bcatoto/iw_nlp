and if i ever find out youre going out the back door on natalie again youre the one whos gon na be hanging by your ankles three stories up understand none of this wouldve happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or selfrestraint which you didnt you would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking shes the villain in the piece you are lydia may not have been one of humanitys finer specimens but easy sketchy you dont ill give it my best shot and were sure lydias gon na make her move howd you get her out of town or i dissolve into an angry hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again which is probably what would really happen a philandering pig you set up on lydia when shes on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up i answer the door and pretend to be natalie and why should she what happens if you level with her fight fire with fire threaten to go to her husband a toy and lydia telling natalie the truth makes you a victim in what way does this person have a name then a sympathetic mouth then a sympathetic and you were a sympathetic ear really here it comes the part where the guy turns everything around you left out condescending or do you think were just so grateful to have one of you idiots well look the other way which is arrogant and condescending do guys actually believe their lame self serving excuses i dont see how you cheating on natalie involves me you blew off your girlfriend last night even though it was the big oneoh id be pissed off too if i was her whats up hey sketchy right the big oneoh

havent been a writer since i got into the misery business when i wrote my first book i used to carry it around in this while i was looking for a publisher that was a good book marcia i was a writer

get the money from your father why dont you come in for a while i dont see you crying about my drinking it what is a sip of coffee going to do my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it every summer the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddys farm we would get up with the chickens every summer the fence had to be repaired the barn needed a coat of paint we had to pip all of big mamas hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday for big daddy calluses and sweat were the mark of a man sunny will never have to bust his knuckles

me up im going back home with harry i need to get my suitcase out of the garage doesnt he look a whole of lot better he will be alright i was hoping you came to the door instead of him it gets cold at night babe brother this would be a bad time for me to leave i heard his voice as clear as day i better get back maybe something is wrong i could swear i heard my son call me anytime you need someone to do something for you just let me know it is just a regular card what is that dont pick up the cards if you are not in the game did he die did you ever have to use this thinghere i am thinking about

working in the fields hardly surviving he asked a man who was getting a drink of water i thought the streets were paved with gold they are but you wont see them he said boy you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back picking their teeth man this is a dream he asked whats youll doing they all hollered back sinning the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said please to meet you he asked i thought youll was supposed to be

window man act like this is your home man put your boxes down and stay as long as you like we have empty rooms since the boys got their own families and moved out stay until you feel better i would like to hear all the news why didnt you catch a plane he knows better sunny apologize to harry this is my grandson sunny he is my youngest sons childwe are going where the action is aint that right okra lets play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up what would you give to be rich i dont want to wear out welcome but you can stay in someones heart longer than you can stay in their house come with us boy we are going to have a good time you probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there son would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom my hand is too weak and would you do me another favor i dont like asking this but would you clean the tub for me i have trouble bending over son i can take everything you got with that deck it is marked now im going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere never play with someones elses cards you always get a new deck look at this card see anything boy that is the real south that is real corn liquor i dont know what happened to him he just ran out into the streets i got some old records i want you to hear i like the blues sung simply man and a guitar or sung by a woman who had bad luck all her life dont ever let anyone tell you his lifes story if it is of a weary life full of sadness when i was a boy a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and ill be damned if the same thing didnt happen to me that is called a crab apple switch its for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog now i dont know if i actually did what i did or got my life and story mixed in with other folks stories but i seem to recall that i had to use my crab apple on a boy from back home i was up in memphis working on the railroad like your daddy who had an easy job he would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track anyway i was coming down beale street and i heard this music coming from a saloon sure enough it was emory my daddy taught both of us to play but emory was natural at it got in a blues band and what not he and another boy had killed a boy named hocker sometime back and they balled the jack leaving town emory had lost one eye and had a scar running down his face bad luck i would say he got to drinking that corn liquor we went to his girls room and he wouldnt stop drinking he started talking about the old days and he went mad he pulled his knife and i got to mine first the lights went out boy i thought you were about to cross the river it hasnt been the years its been the men in her life course you could be right your sons are alive all my sons are dead you still call him boy you call babe brother boy in front of his wife and son everyone has to follow his own plough a man doesnt have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays city people dont give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays you dont plant old ways but at the end you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you its when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they dont want it you sell it to a stranger you worked your whole life for what i doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm all what weve experienced has no meaning course it is your business but i feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy everything these days is made overseas how often is your wife called to help delivery oh i would feel much at home if you let me get one for you i havent wrung a chickens neck in a month of sundays you know folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs that used to be my trade from time to time next time when i feel a little better perhaps good morning im going to wash up now you all please excuse me thats awful generous of you i always ask to keep from wearing out welcome well if youre sure i wont be a bother oh i dont sleep on no spring mattress i always make myself a pallet on the floor im worn out but wont you feel like you are taking in a stranger my feet have never been on anything that wasnt directly attached to the ground i came all the way from detroit by bus going to oakland the bus stopped in los angeles i had to get off and take a rest ill catch the last bus leaving at midnight im just too tired to go on boy that is bad luck to touch a fellow with a broom he kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age you invited me i dont make no bones about where im going to spend eternity i have always been wild and you know that if you are made to feel half a man what do you think the other half is since she has repented all she does is throw stones as god is my witness i have never done anything to that woman good afternoon ladies i made a fresh pot of coffee okra and i thought you need a rest ill stand guard okra wants to talk to you anyway how is he doing only if you can spare it that smells like fresh coffee you just run along ill fix him his soup he will be all right let me earn my keep ill go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot try to make him some cow tea next time i hope that its nothing serious ah you young folks dont know how it is how is gideon today how is everybody whats the problem here you got to know everything do everything and be everything ill be right there all those places that us coloreds lived that we used to call bottoms have all been changed to drives and heights everything is in what you call it not in what it is you remember that boy who lost his mind joe you could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark he wouldnt miss a one make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe he would pick up a brick and say go on in there brick and hit somebody and it would find its mark where we come from you had to know how to act right you had to know how to say yes sir and no sir you had to know your place no if i rest any longer i wont sleep tonight may i use your bathroom to wash up a bit good evening it must be all the different time zones i crossed that makes me feel this weary well i dont want to put you out emory had made a lot of enemies he had a big mouth those boys never did have good luck i think if anybody had a hand in killing hocker you ought to ask or you should have asked emory and chick strange as it may seem it might have cleared the waters sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason what difference does it make if its persimmon oak tree or huckleberry bush wasnt hocker lynched now who are we talking about oh i wasnt pointing my finger at you hey you have to think of yourself a lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep there are too many bad people out there of course not have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people no you aint you have to take just one and fatten him up when you spread help too thin you you just nickel and dime the situation if you try to save all all die but if you save one life life goes on you just have to remember medicine that works leaves a bitter taste good god almighty bless your bones but the problem grows how many people do you all feed well you and your husband are special ya gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor a woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days i already have my dear oh im sorry gideon what do you say speaking of tappy heads we ought to have an old fashion fish fry out of weariness i spoke to my own heart to leave it all and to die and i gave my heart to know madness and folly now i was trying to be nice to make conversation since we go back some that is a boy from home lullas brother i know your mother aint still operating that house of hers why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone i remember when you werent saved that was way back yonder when the natchez trace was just a dirt road girl do you still sing and dance you never know whats in the heart and just because you can cry doesnt make you human ya but you cant do the shuffle with one leg you and your wife in your spare time work with the less fortunate now im not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance dont take me wrong but you cant judge people by how you act youre a caring person country people got so many strange ways some folks take that natural stuff too far did you have your child at home in some things when we were children there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didnt have something on you that didnt make a x you dont want to be at crossroads without one its a charm that old people teach you how to make i had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child in my travels i misplaced it i have been looking over my shoulder ever since i let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that i lost years ago not you mustnt touch your mama might not like you handling knives oh im more modern in my ways i dont believe in sin though there is good and evil and evil is a thing you work atim sorry he got those birds where is skip counting the what what does that have to do with the price of butter what are you doing
