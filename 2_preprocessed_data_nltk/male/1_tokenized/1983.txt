man traitor shell marry you in hell then we must reach her before she feels that pain never can she be forced lyssa why yes no we will find another way to locate the fortress but you suspect why the first time when they attacked long ago was the beast here i can not reach her i will find her she was very faint i was barely able to reach her she cant see out she cant tell us where the fortress is darkness tunnels and corridors wait i cant reach her they know when theyre going to die yes they will be more help than highborn barons nor will i till my bride is beside me then we must be ready five leagues from here is the eastern tower i know the barons who hold it good men and brave they will help us then even if lyssa tells us where she is well never be able to reach her for they will never allow the fortress to rise near us the fortress moves she was in a great fortress first in the mountains then in the jungle how is that possible lyssa lyssa there is nothing you wont have to you have rope but there is another entrance to this place two or three days while lyssa is in their hands in the old books its called a glaive i have no extraordinary powers we were married then she was taken by the slayers you must help me the new queen lives the white castle has fallen each to his fate it is today saddles you have done it what will happen slayers how did you know i can not i feel your pain but i can not betray her i can not betray my bride i can not take comfort when she has none i ache with it yes yes yes i dont think that i know the cruelty of such a fate you and i will guard the fire not yet my friend its your tomato thats dying i have need of friends i was hoping i might be your friend he saved our lives what business perhaps he expected to eat it a forest near the valley of needles i doubt it the water is only an inch deep theres no way to outrun it you know that this is what ynyr was preparing me for its what he died for make for the wall ill catch up i intend to keep you alive your majesty so you can abdicate your throne and become my warlord subject to the king no doubt at the gallop we could reach it on firemares go i command you the best but my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding yours to it go join them forgive me my friends i saw terrible things hand over your dinner these well pay for we must try to get horses i knew you would not be thats why i chose you forgive me its childish to cry no im not hungry why do they burn the villages theres nothing to gain im all right that i promise you to the place where death lives so your sons will speak of you to your grandsons and your grandsons to their grandsons you will follow me i know you because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for fame is what you leave to your sons fame i dont think youll grow carelesscolwyn dont be a fool you cant do battle with that thing perhaps if the pay is good a good thrust my friend another second and thered have been nothing between my head and shoulders but bad memories naturally youre resourceful my lad i tell you one year under my tutelage and i could make you the prince of thieves we must cover a hundred leagues before sunrise those beasts can not be saddled by mortal men yes my lord well it is true that if i received a royal command i couldnt very well disobey it could i what kind of friend do you think i am they do not exist except in the waters of the swamp where they will remain a flicker of talent lad you have an unnatural desire to pay for things it stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination yes it will double our range i know at least a dozen ways to get horses all cheap youve eaten nothing well im not impressed those are not childs tear a child cries for himself a man cries for those he loves not sleepy either they burn many villages even walled cities fall to them when did you last sleep boy i compel no man to follow me on this journey it should be an interesting journey then and where do you lead boy and in the few seconds before i dice you to crowfood tell me why i am going to follow you they stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes do you know who i am sprout i am torquil lord of the forest my men follow no man but me and i follow no man at all hah you dont know me boy how did you know i had sons fame thank you no fame is the burial ground of contentment eat it and go hungry count it and go broke seek it and grow mad fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun smart as well as quick now what do you have to give us look at its insides i cant hold the weight of both of you your boast is a bigger mouthful than your roast magnificence passable pimple very passable oh my poor stomach i must take the old man to see some sick children kegan will guard you surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison we have plenty of hares many villagers are hiding in the forest they need food you had better manners as a pig but also very young six to one is no odds boy that is true kegan look ill stay behind and keep them busy its a hundred leagues from here each to his fate lad fewer will survive them her name is death she has the power to kill that creature helps no one and none who go there return the widow of the web the leader of the dark ones no maze to me my fried it is where we take refuge when they hunt us we can save half a day by crossing the stone lake theres an emerald circle a few leagues from here well find her knowledge i wouldnt wanti can because i choose it it is my fate to die in the fortress you must move quickly the beast will stop at nothing now cut cut use your sword i chose the wrong passage the spiral begins in the west she must make a glaive yes to keep her from you but now that we are inside the fortress you will be able to contact her they will hold lyssa in the center of the vortex the place of the beast where its power is greatest no man can match it there lyssa must try to move toward us for as we enter the vortex and move closer he ran a great risk helping us today if he opposes his fate his death will be terribly painful you must never know her name if more than one approaches she will certainly kill them alone i may have a chance from here i must go alone he sees betrayal everywhere he will attack us so long as he is conscious he thinks you betray him with lyssa colwyn the waters deceive you yes you are young you dont understand the attraction of great power and you forget the pain of long waiting no she must agree of her own free will like you she has extraordinary powers he would make her his queen he has come for lyssa there is no other way you asked me why the beast had come this time you will know in good time im not sure no then they were led by his underlings but i knew he had come this time from the ferocity of their onslaught from their use of the fortress they use up much of their strength to do these things they are taking great risks she is too deep the curved tunnel we saw is part of the vortex the place of the beast the deeper she goes the harder it is to contact her once she is below the second level you will not be able to reach her at all yes they knew of your first contact so they drove her below what do you see everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death you choose these you have not slept in two days no they occupy the fortress but they can not control its movement it is moved by fate and sooner or later fate will place it near us yes each dawn it rises in a different land sometimes in the mountains sometimes in the jungle sometimes the desert sometimes the sea never in the same place twice it is the fortress of krull i know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds they did not use it on our world in the first great war for it costs them enormous power this time they mean to conquer at all costs you must break when the strain becomes too great or you will harm yourself and you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most what did she answer reach out farther call to her i am too old to climb down a rope but it opens onto the sheer wall of the needle theres no way down there is no other way with two or three days practice youll be able to use it as well as i can then well have a chance of fighting our way out of here your powers are greater than you know have you ever seen one of these this is not the first time the dark ones have attacked our world they came once before a thousand years ago a young king and queen with extraordinary powers were given to us then to lead the struggle my forefather was their councilor as i will be yours i have lived in this place like my fathers before me guarding the old knowledge i knew when i had no son that the great war would come in my time and that i would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king come turolds son was to marry her does the queen live no he will master the leader he is the king he didnt join them they joined him if that were so youd be dead now he was aiming at the dark one for there is ancient hatred between them once his race had two eyes like other men until his forefathers bargained with the dark ones they gave up one of their eyes in return for the power to see the future but they were cheated for the only future they were permitted to see was the time of their own death the one with red eyes was a dark one the other was a cyclops and it was not you he meant to kill the forest is not safe these days youd best travel with us the dark ones will appose you with all their power yes it is the western ocean it is the time you know the voice the new king we seek the fortress of krull go now quell was wise he knew that a man can not ask more of his death than it help his friends it is too late he has drunk yes they are weakening it takes great power to maintain the fortress and they have expended much it is not necessary they will not follow we must reach the valley of reeds before the next dawn each to his fate wait for me at the inn if i am not back by dawn you will know my fate and you must go on without me few have survived it she had another name once perhaps she will not kill me for i know her name she has the power of vision yes i must go to the widow perhaps she will help yes like you a king a king of many worlds all enslaved many have perished in that maze well seek an emerald seer they have great powers of vision no they are sad solitary creatures rarely seen you will come with me i can not stop the sand then the other lyssa will share your fate she will grow old in the fortress as you have grown old here a young man seeks her a young man about the age i was when i met you could i lie to you and still see your beauty there is a girl there her name is lyssa the fortress of krull when will it come near here knowledge memory is no trick it is a power the power to see you see it is no trickery where is he my son you said nothing you told me nothing we had no

doesnt back you up in your mistakes who tells you when to pull back and the americans were good allies simple as that freshman and sophomores thank you yes please id want to set out events as they happened the way i see it is this the british empire was an ideal it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century but it wasnt totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some selfrespect which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do then theres the essential no id want to from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez break away completely from no thanks id like to break away hello we dont seem to get much time to talk shall we have a drink or something why not thatll be fun what did he

no theres a fourth numbness you do everything right but you feel nothing either way everyone describes the same process at first it is exciting youre at the centre of the world as soon as anything happens youre the first to know about it and there are deadlines a dozen times a day even more and thats intimidating and exciting then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off your a clerk in a rather dowdy office theres none of the glamour of television or the penetration of serious journalism youre a processor of semiofficial news some people leave at this stage then if you hang on and especially if youre promoted you discover a new kind of pleasure youre pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts by the way you ca judge length ending a broadcast on the dot having everything run smoothly selecting a running order that makes sense knowing instinctively what you can and can not do professionalism too bad what did your father do you dont like flashbacks because your mothers a historian really i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good oh but he was terrific i couldnt bear for it to end i thought it was
