have a choice it isnt your decision tell us where do we go where do we go from here we were sent here and you know it others have been sent here where are they hiding where do you think we came from how do you think we got here were hungry do you have anything to eat all right what are you i dont care just get it over with just the face your own work thanks i thought youd be older i expected a red i didnt do anything francis theyve made us believe that it has nothing to do with you im fine see you anybody we know did you did you ever see anybody renew no its that last runner someone in 483

course not im curious not sick did you ever see francis8 no but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that one for one song of yours you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape but you dont know you just say what everyone says one for one one for one just wondered what happens has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are even the alarm didnt wake him open your eyes once idiot its not every day that a sandman son is born im telling you francis thats him turn this way no no not you you of course i dont know where i just took them for granted its our only chance its part of the hydrogalvanic system the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow beloved wife sanctuary is the right to live nothing more but nothing less either yes you and i jessica jessica listen to me listen to me the lifeclocks made me kill francis they make people die or be killed every day if i didnt try and destroy that i couldnt live here or anywhere do you understand things change do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them im going to try and tell people what weve seen and we cant were going back what are we promising him what can we possibly give him no there doesnt not really just so many want it to exist so many who dont want to die want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes real but it doesnt exist it never existed just the hope you want there to be one that doesnt one in a million i suppose that sweet madman how could he come to exist it could be they all have names and numbers on them i wonder what they are i have never seen a face like that before it must be the look of great age whoever he was he was terribly old of course you know jessica the lifeclocks have no power outside youre right it must be near now well find it how would anyone know even if we find it we can never go back it all seemed to make sense until box i wont i doubt it why dont we rest here we know we can eat these sooner or later well have to try something well be all right we will it feels like breath it makes everything move your hair is moving i guess so i know i felt something i never felt before and i didnt like it not a bit ill tell you one thing sanctuary better be worth it thats the last place for me to live now i had to i did kill for the first time in my life i killed you knew that i wasnt before didnt you why did you stay with me it doesnt make any difference anymore its brighter there besides we cant go back some kind of breeding pens i suppose they say people used to breed animals fish anything to eat of course its the only way why jessica youre still a green how will they know were coming you think sandmen will theres no other way for me id rather take my chances with them than with francis will he find us and kill us yes or one of the others you know theres only one place to go now because hes my friend and i dont want to be killed by him or anyone are you taking me to them then why dont you leave me go to them explain thats nothing theres a sandman behind us too and therell be more soon take me to them all right but why i didnt kill the runner where sanctuary can you take me there the cubs when theyre flying on muscle theres no way to catch up without the dazzle theyd just go past us too fast just follow no matter how it seems lets see how long has it been when did you begin to question lastday uhuh insane nurseries are better than any mother could be instead of what nine months inside a woman were all raised the same but most of us dont become cubs in cathedral theyre like beasts wild thats nice why

asked him the goddamn question you overslept what was the mistake do you think its been rigged all along the way leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered they couldnt have set us up better after all these months our credibilitys gone you know what that means woodward i know a guy in the justice department who was around the grand jury how many fucking sources they think we got and the fbi confirmswhat more do you need jesus i wish we were investigating attila the hun whats the matter well we are trying to ruin his life nah maybe who mitchell stans magruder kalmbach hell give us a sworn statement you think this was clawsens initiation you think were being set upchrist deep throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the white house and up traipses marilyn naming names what would you have done cause i only know four chords segovia begged me for me secret but i said no andres youll have to try and make it without me because a year before the republicans werent ahead not in the polls muskie was running ahead of nixon then before he self destructed now the reason no one believed the republicans is because there wasnt any reason they were so far ahead but segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break in dwight chapin nixons appointments chiefhe knew segretti in school maybe im crazy but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense what were the three theories thats what weve got to find out but segretti went to southern cal and so did a bunch of nixon men for the first time im beginning to feel like a fucking reporter woodward i got a tip a guy called me up with a tip someone named donald segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if theyd like to go to work with him screwing up the democrats dirty tricks shit like that the fbi knows about segretti howard hunt made a bunch of phone calls to himthey interrogated him but on account of segretti wasnt involved with the breakin they didnt follow through but segretti did a lot of travelinghe called these lawyers from different places and he told them the republicans knew what he was doing i want you to shut up and listen to me almost every source weve used has been republican this guys a card carrying democrat i know a lawyer at justice if we could name the guys got the reports wed be ahead again we got ta top the times goddamnit the lookout in the motor inn he say anything we dont know lookfive men controlled that slush fund as creepthree of them weve got mitchell stans magruder and were pretty sure of kalmbach colson nothingi just found out that jeb magruder from creep is a bigger bike freak than i am i never like it when the other guys human and ill just shitkick in my usual way hes another ivy leaguer so hell probably expect you to be understandingmight surprise him if youre not how do you want to handle sloan she was really paranoid the bookkeeper it goes very highweve got to find out where weve got to find out who the five guys arethe five with access to the slush fundthey were aware of the breakin i couldnt believe what she told me eight cups of coffee worth you voted for him 68 whod you vote for republican i hate both parties we appreciate your positionreally we understand your problem we never reveal our sources which is why you can talk to us i just wish we knew when someone would talk to us thats all we know theres got to be something or they wouldnt be so panicked facts or theory i never scared anyone before my first day as a copy boy i was sixteen and wearing my only grownup suitit was cream colored at 230 the head copy boy comes running up to me and says my god havent you washed the carbon paper yet if its not washed by three itll never by dry for tomorrow and i said am i supposed to do that and he said absolutely its crucial so i run around and grab all the carbon paper from all the desks and take it to the mens room im standing there washing it and its splashing all over me and the editor comes in to take a leak and he says what the fuck do you think youre doing and i said its 230 im washing the carbon paper just wanted you to know ive done dumber things than get us lost thats all i dont get it this really was my turf alphabetically on the creep phone list miss helen abbott of south george street were you eyebrow reading andand see her get anything christ and i even know somebody at the phone company fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in miami to gordon liddy at creep im trying goddamnit whats that and you havent called him that was fun what now about the past year we need a sympathetic face it makes sense hunt worked for the cia and the white house was paranoid about teddy kennedy maybe a political operative of some sort what do you think i lived here all my life i got a million contacts but theyre all bus boys and bellhops hmm what though it cant be the republicanshed never allow something as stupid as this not when hes gon na slaughter mcgovern anyway well barker tried to get blueprints of the miami convention center and the airconditioning system let me lay a little theory on you forget it the main thing did you call me a failure you heard they put us both on the breakin thing simons liked the way we worked together listen im sorry i said your story was bullshit yeah mainly it has to do with your choice of words read em both and youll see mines better theyre all the same all those ivy league placesthey teach you about striped ties and suddenly youre smart you only got the job because both you and bradlee went to yale what have you been here nine monthsi been in this business since i was sixteen it was bullshit the way it was i sure couldnt hurt it could i night 1130 sir id like to ask you a few to become president nixons campaign manager on march 1 mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund almost a year before he left the justice department according to sources involved in the watergate investigation beginning in the spring of 1971 fund that was used to gather information against the democrats john n mitchell while serving as us attorney general personally controlled a secret cash fund that this naw yeah that was in the times this morning the telephone calls we know about that whatever im on deadline look youve been jerking my chain all day if theres some reason you cant talk to melike the fact that youve already leaked everything to the new york timesjust say so good just tell him i was here that im sorry i missed him mr dardis does call in every so often could you reach mr dardis by car radio i called him from washington hes the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning id really like to see mr dardis hi its me im still here teddy kennedy any idea what he did howard hunt at usc you had a word the this screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking ever wonder if nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all it gets interesting if it was haldeman because our word is that when chapin says something hes gotten the ok from haldeman and when haldeman says something hes gotten the ok from the president on the orders of haldeman chapin did contact you then but you know who did you wrote the canuck letterthe one where you claimed muskie slurred the canadians during the florida primary you wrote a letter on muskie stationery saying scoop jackson had a bastard child you wrote another that said hubert humphrey was out with call girls tell that to muskie do you feel much about the things you did when did he hire you by they you mean the white house dont you your buddy from usc dwight chapin he works for the white house by they you mean listenwe know youre involved in thiswere going to get the story why not help according to what weve been able to verify youve been busy mind if i try im carl bernstein my paper sent me out to see if i couldnt persuade you to go on the record donald segretti he was going to go into law practice with segretti weve just been talking to young yes down to miami and backhow much damage can i do that was awhile ago i think it might be helpful if youd send me to miami harry i just talked to a miami investigator about barker absolutely if he did it or just said he did it god knows theres nothing new in it what whats a real denial and we got a guy in justice no nobodys perfect im glad youre out of it hannah youre a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper theres always a later plane its right under that pile i think five hundred six maybe hey very tense oh theyre here im keeping much better records now hannah see hannah i never would have bothered you but im off to miami and theyre gon na take away my ten speed unless i get it straightened out fast hey easy if you dont like it down there why dont you quit fbi too you dont really think youre being followed this is practically a high school reunion for us janei would have sprung for a classier place think sloans being set up as a fall guy for john mitchell sometimes it looks that way gordon liddy you mean its awfully hot and you havent finished telling me about the money sloan knew which five didnt he who were they which people could buy a lot of steaks 350000 dollars it was all in hundreds wasnt it its obvious you want to talk to someonewell im someone i was just curiousyou dont do it well so i wondered have you been threatened if you told the truth is that it right right ive got to go why did you lie just then you were hugh sloans bookkeeper when he worked for maurice stans at finance and we were sort of wondering did you go work for stans immediately after sloan quit or was there a time lapse we dont tell anyone that which is why you can talk to us and if we cant verify what you say someplace else we dont print it thats another reason you can relax but i want you to know that i understand why youre afraida lot of good people down there at the committee are afraid im really sorry for what youre being put through just let me get a match irwin i really feel bad doing something like thisyou know that dont you who by just tell me about the goddamn article something maybe big no games irwin give so tell me about the times article why couldnt you have just dialed me from the office irwin if we wrote a story that said haldeman controlled the fund that leaves haldeman period its got ta be haldemansomeone from the white house had to be involved thisll only take one second what happens when the baby comes ordinarily though what was the procedure right kalmbachnixons personal lawyer but they both worked at the white house to cover up because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors do you think the truth will come out at the trial then again maybe things are even worse than weve writtenyoull have to find that out wont you youve done worse than let haldeman slip away youve got people feeling sorry for himi didnt think that was possible a conspiracy like this the rope has to tighten slowly around everyones neck you build from the outer edges and you go step by step if you shoot too high and miss then everybody feels more secure youve put the investigation back months i was being cautious you can safely say more then fifty yes yes everything there were over fifty people employed by the white house and creep to ratfuck some of what they did is beyond belief nationwidemy god they were frightened of muskie and look who got destroyedthey wanted to run against mcgovern and look who theyre running against they bugged they followed people false press leaks fake letters they canceled democratic campaign rallies they investigated democratic private lives they planted spies stole documents on and on dont tell me you think this was all the work of little don segretti dont you miss the grand scheme too follow every leadevery lead goes somewhere dont concentrate on segretti or youll miss the overall scheme too total manipulation i suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the constitution but they dont think along philosophical lines you get nothing from me about haldeman of coursemy god you think something this big just happens the breakin and the cover up of course mitchell knew but no more than ehrlichman someone with authority id imagine wouldnt you dont you know what youre onto come on they know but they focused on the burglaryif it didnt deal with the breakin they didnt pursue it i hope you noticed how coolly i behaved under the threat of discovery did you change cabs it didnt work something moved there youll have to find that out wont you yes the little ratfuckers are now running our government in my day it was simply called the double cross i believe the cia refers to it as mindfuck in our context it simply means infiltration of the democrats my turn to keep you waiting whats the topic for tonight talk once at a gathering he put his hand over a candle and he kept it there he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared a woman who was watching asked whats the trick and he replied the trick is not minding what i know youll have to find out on your own melodramatic things are past thatremember these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city you changed cabs youre sure no one followed you go on follow the money always follow the money because the press stinks toohistory on the run thats all youre interested in you come up with anything then there must be something mustnt there look forget the myths the medias created about the white house the truth is these are not very bright guys and things got out of hand you thought id help out on specifics ill confirm what you get try to keep you on the right track but thats all are you guys really working how much i saw the flag signalwhats upand speak you got more than one source youre the fella who forgot he rented a hertz car do i have to tell you they didnt forget to send us the bill i think it might be helpful if youd send me to toronto that was your spiel then the lifestyles of deserters im still waiting for it im the one sent you to toronto bernstein so absolutelyand thats all they do sit sit sitevery once in a while they call up a senator some reporting ask him what hes really sayinghe means take the story away from woodstein and give it to his people at the national desk correctionwhen you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the sans souci quit equivocating say what you mean our story got government accounting to start an audit on creeps finances you are ignoring the importance of the dahlberg repercussions who you got i think we got a white house consultant linked to the bugging so whaddya got whaddya got just that on his office wall theres a cartoon with a caption reading when youve got them by the balls their hearts and minds will follow the second most powerful man is robert haldeman just below him are a trio mr erlichman is haldemans friend and they protect the president from everybody which is why they are referred to as either the german shepherds or the berlin wall mr mitchell weve already discussed mr colson is the presidents special counsel the most powerful man in america is president nixon probably youve heard his name i would liken your query to being in russia half a century ago and asking someone i understand who lenin is and trotsky i got too but whos this yokel stalin i cant sell hints to simons you called everyone you know call someone you dont know whatd you get on whouse as a rough rule of thumb as far as i can throw bronco nagurski thats how much i trust john mitchell mr john mitchell the head of creep says it means nothing this man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent these is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity and we will not forget it or condone it then how come the associated press were the ones found out that mr mccord is security coordinator for the committee to reelect the president otherwise known as creep ok get on this whouse guy and do a better job then you did on mccord dont know who the hells howard hunt its probably nothing but check it out just go easy it could be crazy cubans go on go on two oclock work the phones til you go as usual that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly except it wasnt local democratic headquarters it was national democratic headquarters and these werent just any idiots these were special idiots seeing as when they were arrested at 230 this morning they were all wearing business suits and playtex gloves and were carrying a walkietalkie forty rolls of film cameras lock picks pensized tear gas guns plus various bugging devices not to mention over two thousand dollars mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills wheres that cheery face weve come to know and love one senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes maybe im tense listen i love this country you think i want to bring it downim not some goddamn zany i was a hawk listen we didnt make them do these thingsonce they did its our job to report it political personal sexual anything at all against mitchell i know i did but damnit howard for the first time since ive known him i think hes really humping that was awhile ago howard i can predict the next words youre gon na say anyone but bernstein i want to send a reporter to miami could develop woodwards onto a new wrinkle with the breakin thingabsolute page one stuffcant help you i dont know anything about haldeman except dwights frightened of him everybodys frightened of himchrist i wish id never gotten messed around with thisall i wan na do is sit in the sun sit swim see some girls sureoff the record none of it was my idea carli didnt go looking for the job when you guys print it in the paper then ill know im a lawyer and ill probably go to jail and be disbarred and what did i do that was so awful i didnt sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe off the record oh maybe nickel and dime stuff i didnt do anything wrong i know where dwight works they never told me anything except my own rolei had to find out the rest in the papers ive got a lot of energy you cant thats rightso i guess you could say that we screwed up but we werent wrong goddamnit only everything hmm we got twenty minutes to deadline deep throat wont confirmi never thought he was scared of anyone but hes scared of haldeman sloan told the grand juryhe answered everything they asked him that means theres a record somewhere he said john haldeman not bob haldeman maybe we are same as magruder i dont like it when they turn out to be human its nothing personal though what if i went up and introduced myselfthink hed slug me haldeman i think thats him were working on the last guy now and were going all the waythat fifth man was haldeman that cash fund that financed the sabotaging of the democratsfive guys had control were inside the white house now could have won him a fraternity paddle with a white house seal god knows it worked it makes a crazy kind of sense remember that initiation rite they have at the white house each new member of the presidents staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of nixon you asking would i have been one of the presidents men i would have been california illinois florida new hampshireall the major democratic primary states why does everything you play sound the same segretti crisscrossed the country over ten times in six monthsand never stayed anyplace over a night or two switch to another station huh youre driving me crazy with that if he selfdestructed so maybe watergate wasnt really about watergatemaybe that was just a piece the burglary was done by cubans or democrats or republicans haldeman i know who else how high up which republicans i havent said anything then hes got an ax call him anyway has he got an ax shit who do we know i know i know shit just that a lot of reports were sent to creep but he doesnt name who not here anyway the la times has a huge interview with baldwin wed like to wait til we have all five before we print it there had to be a white house overseer think sloans back whats wrong you want me to be the bastard you mean whos going to play the mean mp and whos going to be the nice one whichever that happens to people ok go on we will then tomorrows grand jury indictments will just be bullshit go on go on did he just say what i think he said nixon when sure and im a republican you believe in the president you wouldnt ever want to do anything disloyal its safe try it youll see and that somethings got to be more than just hunt liddy and the five burglarsthose indictments are gon na be bullshit when they come down what else do we know anything youve got its not us they were scared before we got there what do we know this is terrific work if you like rejection youre not a kid anymore whos first it was there i just dont get it a creep secretary being scared thats one thing but what does the wife of one of the most powerful men in america have to be afraid of she was panicked carlevery time i mentioned watergate you could tell for the paper no for us plenty i waited a long time and finally this big guyi guess a bodyguard he left and i knocked and she remembered me we talked awhile you dowith access to records why didnt we get that fifteen phone calls see the fucking new york times i met a presidential aide once at a social occasion july of 71 you think they are confidential i dont know anything about how this town works i havent lived here a year yet a spy you mean hunt doesnt seem like your ordinary consultant what do you think he meant this particular incident were there others how would we find out you know anyone important hey right nixon didnt get where he got by being dumb listen that was a watergate question and mccord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the democratic convention the times has got to be full of it it cant be crazy cubans im not interested in theory what do we know for example hunts disappeared all right what do we know i was sure trying its ok im sorry i called you a failure fuck you carl carl what is it about my writing thats so rotten no way im smart enough to know my story was solid bradlee went to harvard and youve had some fucking meteoric rise thats for sureby the time you turn forty you might be the head of the montana bureau i have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from virginia it was fine the way it was what the hell were you doing rewriting my story mitchell started the coverup early everyone is involved in the cover up all the way to the top the whole us intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities the extent of it is incredible and peoples lives are in danger maybe including ours electronic surveillance im sure he went to her apartment and he told her his dialing finger must be falling off i saw him he verifies he approved the payments to liddy while he was still attorney general i dont know titles you asking me to disclose my source i was told by this guy at the white house that hunt was investigating teddy kennedy i have nothing more to say it was really nice of you to come since youd only met him once a miami social occasion mr rafferty told me the cubans were from miami youre a lawyer and youre here your clients were arrested with a walkietalkie they didnt need that to talk among themselves did you know to come because one of the other men involved in the break in called you well they never would have been assigned if anyone had known the burglars had arranged for their own counsel and that could only mean the burglars didnt arrange for their own counselthey never even made a phone call so if they didnt ask for you to be here how did you know to come probably youre right but a little while ago i was talking to a couple of lawyers whod been assigned to represent the burglars what i dont understand is how you got here you have nothing more to say i understand that mr rafferty was very helpful four cubanamericans and this other man james mccord douglas caddy the attorney of record when questioned about his presence in the courtroom denied he was in the courtroom im not here mr caddy said ok mr caddy my names bob woodward im from the post and i wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case well was it in a bar her apartment some restaurant sorry ken listen one last thing where did your talk with berger happen shes an awfully good reporteri cant remember her getting too much wrong before can you you claiming it was all a misunderstanding ken that checks out with our finding thank you mr dahlberg i see and how do you think it reached miami yes sir the twentyfive thousand dollar one the one with your name on it in bernard barkers florida account bernard barker the watergate burglar this should take only a minute mr dahlberg but were doing a follow up on the breakin and i was kind of curious about your check we know thatand if we were wrong were resigningwere we wrong i know i know the pressures off the white house and its all back on the post fifty ratfuckers directed by the white house to destroy the democrats and justice and fbi know all this how grand the canuck letterwas that a white house operation there were more then talk about segretti why did they do all this for chrissakeswhat were they after haldeman too mitchell knew then why didnt theywho told them not to do justice and the fbi know what we know and why the hell havent they done anything about it what the slush fund at creep financed the ratfucking weve almost got that nailed down so whobe specific how high up i know what it meanssegretti wouldnt go on the record but if he would we know hed implicate chapin and that would put us inside the white house ratfucking liddyyou think theres a chance hell talk whats the whole thing aboutdo you know i did everything you said but it all seemed this man gordon liddyhes going to be tried along with hunt and the five burglarswe know he knows a lot we just dont know what to where john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family that doesnt exactly have the ring of truth howard hunts been foundthere was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag if you dont like them why wont you be more concrete with me i dont know maybe sixteen eighteen hours a dayweve got sources at justice the fbi but its still drying up nothing thats the problemthe storys gone underground i was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at watergate hi im bob woodward of the post and hello im bob woodward of the washing post and mullen and company public relations could you tell me when you expect mr hunt he is nobody ever had too much i would if you really ever wanted to know it is i couldnt say some justice department lawyers and an fbi man and some people from the committee to reelect yes maam it may never come out no i think so im woodward well sloan i never asked them about watergate i only said what were hunts duties at the white house they volunteered that he was innocent when nobody asked was he guilty hunt is colsons man thats charles colson nixons special counsel they both went to brown university hunt worked for the cia till 70 and this is on deep background the fbi thinks hes involved with the breakin thanks harry know anything about colson whos colson harry whos charles colson lotsa hints you cant believe that the head of security for the reelection of a republican president got caught bugging the national offices of the democrats what the hell does that mean i did all right on mccord thats everything bachinski had i think its worth following up preliminary hearing at superior courthouse you call me in on my day off because some idiots have broken into local democratic headquarterstell me harry why should i be smiling he just did and he says chapin hired segretti larry young a california lawyer you think she wants us to ease up on the story what do you think mrs graham wants to see me for no absolutely according to white house personnel hunt definitely works there as a consultant for colson but when i called the white house press office they said he hadnt worked there for three months then the pr guy said the weirdest thing to me i am convinced that neither mr colson nor anyone else at the white house had any knowledge of or participation in this deplorable incident at the democratic national committee look when the watergate grand jury questioned you did you name names and it wasnt ehrlichman or colson or the president a boy or a girl go on one thing im not completely clear onwhen you gave out the money to liddy how did that work haldeman right were not sure weve got all the guys who could order you but we know there were five and as treasurer you could release those funds the report on the cash in maurice stans safe the three hundred fifty thousand thats true does they mean the white house you handed out the money maybe theres a legitimate explanation for the way it was done mr sloan you work there miss abbott no im a reporter i wanted to talk to you about the committee to re elect hi im bob woodward of the washington post and i hate to bother you at homethanks stop jivin one more round no doctor im feelin good bro
