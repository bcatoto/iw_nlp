     FADE IN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON BLACK SCREEN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SPORTSCASTER'S VOICE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Allright, bowl bid ridin' here for
     <br/>
     E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia
     <br/>
     Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em
     <br/>
     down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INSTANT CUT TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes
     <br/>
     set, frosted breath steaming across to:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLOSE ON JOE KANE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped,
     <br/>
     and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the
     <br/>
     slop.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE
     <br/>
     END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by,
     <br/>
     grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is
     <br/>
     closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass
     <br/>
     toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him
     <br/>
     face-down in the swamp.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY
     <br/>
     GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two
     <br/>
     DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing
     <br/>
     as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The
     <br/>
     ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes
     <br/>
     to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete.
     <br/>
     The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then
     <br/>
     drops his head in defeat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense,
     <br/>
     early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across
     <br/>
     the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REPORTER #1 (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Coach, this is the second year in a
     <br/>
     row you've failed to go to a bowl
     <br/>
     game. Do you feel your program's in
     <br/>
     decline?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by
     <br/>
     reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (keeping his cool)
     <br/>
     No, we're just a young team on the
     <br/>
     verge. We'll be back in a major bowl
     <br/>
     next year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-
     <br/>
     splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his
     <br/>
     locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes
     <br/>
     danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly,
     <br/>
     a sense of repressed anger off it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Good throw, Joe. It was there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     So was half their team.
     <br/>
     (trailing off)
     <br/>
     Shit, another Christmas at home.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Next year, man. Next year we sell
     <br/>
     out. Next year we dominate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     still fielding questions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REPORTER #2
     <br/>
     You still need a deep threat or a
     <br/>
     breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.
     <br/>
     What are you gonna do to address
     <br/>
     this need?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COACH WINTERS
     <br/>
     (a little edgy)
     <br/>
     Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you
     <br/>
     guys for a start.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Winters gets up to go, we hear:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WILSON (V.O.)
     <br/>
     I'm not gonna lead you into the fog
     <br/>
     here, Sam...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind
     <br/>
     his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN
     <br/>
     HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR WILSON
     <br/>
     I'm concerned about our Program.
     <br/>
     It's always been a source of pride
     <br/>
     to our students and alumni, but two
     <br/>
     straight so-so seasons are having a
     <br/>
     damaging effect on our fund-raising,
     <br/>
     both public and private.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (half-joking)
     <br/>
     Then stop raising the entrance
     <br/>
     requirements on me. We never could
     <br/>
     have gotten Alvin Mack in here under
     <br/>
     the new guidelines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR WILSON
     <br/>
     As Chancellor, my first responsibility
     <br/>
     is to the academic interests of this
     <br/>
     University.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed
     <br/>
     to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is
     <br/>
     marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is
     <br/>
     $400,000,000.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WILSON
     <br/>
     At a time when we're committed to a
     <br/>
     400 million dollar building program,
     <br/>
     alumni donations are down 15% the
     <br/>
     last two years. Because they've also
     <br/>
     voiced their displeasure to their
     <br/>
     legislators, we can expect a
     <br/>
     corresponding drop in state funds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     The Athletic Fund is suffering too.
     <br/>
     Season tickets sales are off,
     <br/>
     merchandising's slow...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You layin' all this at my door?
     <br/>
     There's been a recession on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR WILSON
     <br/>
     Yes, but the heaviest drop has been
     <br/>
     from the big donors, the 100,000
     <br/>
     dollar club. These people are
     <br/>
     recession proof. They sit in my box
     <br/>
     every game, and they're much more
     <br/>
     generous when we're ranked and going
     <br/>
     to bowl games. Two of them, as you
     <br/>
     know, are on the Board of Regents,
     <br/>
     including the Chairman.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What are you trying to say to me,
     <br/>
     Grant? After 12 years, my job's in
     <br/>
     jeopardy?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR WILSON
     <br/>
     I'm not prepared to discuss your job
     <br/>
     right now; I just want you to be
     <br/>
     aware of the situation. The alumni
     <br/>
     and the legislature are unhappy and
     <br/>
     they vote with their checkbooks. I
     <br/>
     don't pretend to be an expert on
     <br/>
     football, Sam, and I'll deny that
     <br/>
     this conversation ever took place,
     <br/>
     but I do know we need to win next
     <br/>
     year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and
     <br/>
     CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to
     <br/>
     a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY
     <br/>
     of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     (ignoring the effigy)
     <br/>
     Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary
     <br/>
     and player profiles are in your
     <br/>
     briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow
     <br/>
     in Philly with this kid Darnell
     <br/>
     Jefferson.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton
     <br/>
     fear an outburst, a display of rage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Looks like I've lost weight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch
     <br/>
     up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     This kid's the gamebreaker we've
     <br/>
     been lookin' for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC STARTS. TITLES BEGIN.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - EVENING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COACH CLAYTON (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Had a 108 yard kickoff return against
     <br/>
     Taft. Michigan's been down to see
     <br/>
     him twice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL
     <br/>
     JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room.
     <br/>
     Other boys of various ages and color look in from the
     <br/>
     adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip,
     <br/>
     the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Darnell, you have the potential to
     <br/>
     start for us as a freshman. That 108
     <br/>
     yard kickoff return you made against
     <br/>
     Taft? One of the greatest runs I've
     <br/>
     ever seen a high school player make.
     <br/>
     Now, Michigan is set at tailback for
     <br/>
     two years. You won't play till you're
     <br/>
     a junior. With Joe here gettin' you
     <br/>
     the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right,
     <br/>
     you'll be All-American with us as a
     <br/>
     Sophomore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REVEREND WALLACE
     <br/>
     Yes, but I'm really more concerned
     <br/>
     with Darnell's education. He came
     <br/>
     here late. He's got some catching up
     <br/>
     to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Believe me, education is the first
     <br/>
     priority in our program. That's why
     <br/>
     all the players are smarter than me.
     <br/>
     After all, a football coach is smart
     <br/>
     enough to understand the game, but
     <br/>
     dumb enough to think it's important.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended
     <br/>
     to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA TENANT FARM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We see a run-down tenant SHACK on the edge of a large cotton
     <br/>
     field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. TENANT SHACK - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Two rooms. Dirt floor. Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple
     <br/>
     cart. Alvin Mack's MOTHER opens a Christmas present as Alvin
     <br/>
     and his TWO SISTERS look on. It's an ENGRAVED LIONSHEAD
     <br/>
     DOORKNOCKER, the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent
     <br/>
     home. The inscription reads THE MACK'S. Alvin's mother thinks
     <br/>
     it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN'S MOTHER
     <br/>
     It's real pretty, Alvin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     When I turn pro, I'll get you the
     <br/>
     house to go with it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her
     <br/>
     father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured,
     <br/>
     somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly
     <br/>
     out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>

     <br/>
     It's real nice, Dad.

     INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters sits on the bed, eating Chinese take-out, the phone
     <br/>
     cradled in his neck, talking to Louanne.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I knew you'de like it, Lou. Merry
     <br/>
     Christmas. Put some fresh flowers on
     <br/>
     your Mom's grave for me. I'll be
     <br/>
     home in a couple days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Battered and old, in a declining Pennsylvania neighborhood,
     <br/>
     hard by a STEEL WORKS.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching
     <br/>
     the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their
     <br/>
     last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods
     <br/>
     in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been
     <br/>
     drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses
     <br/>
     Joe an Iron City beer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FRANK
     <br/>
     Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn't
     <br/>
     think we'de see you here this
     <br/>
     Christmas, little brother.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     You won't next year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S FATHER
     <br/>
     (getting up)
     <br/>
     Yeh, well we won't rent your place
     <br/>
     on the couch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty
     <br/>
     beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree.
     <br/>
     We see that the whole tree is covered with cans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. PHILADELPHIA BOY'S HOME - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You're from E.S.U?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     GIRL'S VOICE
     <br/>
     Yeh. I was just sittin' here by the
     <br/>
     fire doin' my homework, and decided
     <br/>
     to give you a call. See how you're
     <br/>
     doin'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. OFFICE IN E.S.U. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We see who Darnell is talking to: AUTUMN HALEY, beautiful
     <br/>
     black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not
     <br/>
     street.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Coach Winters has been telling me
     <br/>
     about you. I'm looking forward to
     <br/>
     seeing you when you come to visit.
     <br/>
     I'll be your guide. You are coming
     <br/>
     to visit aren't you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other
     <br/>
     telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises
     <br/>
     with a clipboard of names and numbers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. TUNNEL OF WOLFDEN STADIUM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn
     <br/>
     is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive
     <br/>
     than Darnell thought she'd be.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field
     <br/>
     where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school
     <br/>
     fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking,
     <br/>
     pom-poms whirling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat
     <br/>
     stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points
     <br/>
     to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and
     <br/>
     picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     P.A. ANNOUNCER
     <br/>
     Now for the starting line-up for the
     <br/>
     E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback,
     <br/>
     number 20, Darnell Jefferson!!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You got that right.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance.
     <br/>
     Slaps hands with Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PICTURESQUE CAMPUS WALK - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell
     <br/>
     and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's
     <br/>
     dorm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Thanks for showin' me around, Autumn.
     <br/>
     I don't meet too many females like
     <br/>
     you. You got a lotta class. Real
     <br/>
     efficacious. Maybe I'll check you
     <br/>
     out in the fall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I hope so, Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about
     <br/>
     this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to
     <br/>
     let it deepen, then breaks it off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Good night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE BOYS HOME - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's
     <br/>
     home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television
     <br/>
     cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU
     <br/>
     jersey with #1 emblazoned on it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Now you know where I'm going and
     <br/>
     what we're indubitably going to be.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC and TITLES END.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the
     <br/>
     title: 6 MONTHS LATER.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a
     <br/>
     curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one
     <br/>
     battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive
     <br/>
     line tackle, are there to greet him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (shaking hands)
     <br/>
     Yeh, good to see you guys. What
     <br/>
     happened to the band and the dancin'
     <br/>
     honies?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Regular students don't come back for
     <br/>
     two weeks yet. Not that they woulda
     <br/>
     been here. Now that you've enrolled,
     <br/>
     you're just another wormshit freshman.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. BROWNING ATHLETIC DORM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A dorm devoted exclusively to football players. Luxurious
     <br/>
     lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms.
     <br/>
     Spacious living quarters. A world unto itself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Here's your room. If you need anything
     <br/>
     call the hall manager.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell looks around, taking it all in. He tries to be cool,
     <br/>
     but this is easily the nicest room he's ever had.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     See ya later. Freshman Placement
     <br/>
     test tomorrow at nine. McKinnley
     <br/>
     Hall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Bud start down the hall. Darnell turns back into his
     <br/>
     room, then starts to pace off it's dimensions, heel to toe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE 911 - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their
     <br/>
     admirers. A black HARLEY DAVIDSON, driven by Joe Kane with
     <br/>
     Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. They get off,
     <br/>
     head inside.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. THE 911 - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous
     <br/>
     among them is Louanne Winters. Joe and Darnell give her a
     <br/>
     nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players
     <br/>
     wait: Bud Lite, BOBBY COLLINS, good-looking, silver-tongued
     <br/>
     ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and STEVE LATTIMER,
     <br/>
     heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end. Between them is a
     <br/>
     large pitcher of beer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back. There
     <br/>
     goes my cover of the media guide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin? This
     <br/>
     is Darnell Jefferson, freshman
     <br/>
     tailback.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     How ya' doin'?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     I was hopin' you'de have rolled your
     <br/>
     bike or somethin'. Nothin' serious,
     <br/>
     just enough to keep you out for the
     <br/>
     season.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (pouring himself some
     <br/>
     beer)
     <br/>
     No such luck, Backup Man. But I'll
     <br/>
     try to engineer a few blowouts. Get
     <br/>
     you get some mop-up time.
     <br/>
     (studying Lattimer)
     <br/>
     Shit, Lats, you look buffed, man.
     <br/>
     You put on some weight?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     35 lbs. Spent the summer in the gym.
     <br/>
     I'm tired of watchin' you guys play.
     <br/>
     I intend to start this year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     You get any bigger, you can play
     <br/>
     offense.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Yeh, but don't I have to get dumber
     <br/>
     too?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a
     <br/>
     surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He
     <br/>
     gives her the "just a minute" sign.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     You still seein' Louanne?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     Yeh. Now and then, when the tide
     <br/>
     rises. Don't want her to think this
     <br/>
     is some kind've exclusive deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Coach finds out you're nailin' his
     <br/>
     daughter, you'll be playin' dorm
     <br/>
     ball.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     I'll bail before that. Besides, this
     <br/>
     is what he gets for not startin' me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby laughs and heads over to Louanne's table, as Joe pours
     <br/>
     himself another beer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin enters the bar, goes to Joe's table, plops a copy of
     <br/>
     Sports Illustrated down in front of Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hey, man, you seen this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On the cover is a picture of Joe and ONE OTHER QUARTERBACK,
     <br/>
     TIM WAYMEN. The coverline reads, HEISMAN HOPEFULS: THE YEAR
     <br/>
     OF THE QUARTERBACK.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     (ribbing Joe)
     <br/>
     You must be some very bad-ass
     <br/>
     motherfucker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe stares at the cover. He's more stunned than elated.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Jesus...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     What? You didn't know?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I knew there was gonna be an article.
     <br/>
     I didn't know it was gonna be on the
     <br/>
     cover.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Shit, we do all the work. You get
     <br/>
     all the pub. Too bad we're not allowed
     <br/>
     to hit you in practice. Be fun to
     <br/>
     kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy
     <br/>
     Candidate.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I guess you'll have to wait till we
     <br/>
     get to the pros.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     (to Darnell)
     <br/>
     Beer boy, get me some.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Are you serious?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Does it look like I'm serious?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe drains his beer, pours another. Lattimer starts to read
     <br/>
     form the article.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Listen to this. "E.S.U. has a solid
     <br/>
     nucleus returning, but the
     <br/>
     Timberwolves, coming off two
     <br/>
     disappointing seasons, will only go
     <br/>
     as far as the strong right arm of
     <br/>
     Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take
     <br/>
     them." That right, Joe? You gonna
     <br/>
     lead us to the promised land?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I'm gonna lead... but can you follow?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Muted chuckles, but set faces. The challenge accepted. Joe
     <br/>
     chugs his beer, pours another.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby
     <br/>
     and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward
     <br/>
     a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the
     <br/>
     others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The
     <br/>
     others join in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     What are we doin', Joe?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (slightly slurred)
     <br/>
     There's something I wanta try. Gotta
     <br/>
     wake up our Mojo. Start settin' the
     <br/>
     tone for the season.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     This is not a good time to be settin'
     <br/>
     anything. You're in no shape...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Joe, c'mon Joe, don't be an asshole.
     <br/>
     Joe! God-damnit, why's he always
     <br/>
     doin' shit like this? Coach'll fuckin'
     <br/>
     kill me. Alvin, go get him, will ya?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy
     <br/>
     motherfucker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by,
     <br/>
     then lies down on his back, arms at his side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S POINT OF VIEW
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of
     <br/>
     us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly
     <br/>
     worried now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Fuck this shit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft-
     <br/>
     wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     C'mon, Joe, that's enough. Let's get
     <br/>
     the hell outa here. What if somebody
     <br/>
     drifts or crosses the line to pass?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What's the matter, Bud? Can't you
     <br/>
     follow?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     (torn)
     <br/>
     God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head
     <br/>
     touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in.
     <br/>
     Alvin and the others can't believe it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Startin' to look like a loaf of Wonder
     <br/>
     bread out there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     They're makin' us look like pussies,
     <br/>
     ya know. Standin' here suckin' our
     <br/>
     thumbs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (to Alvin)
     <br/>
     Yeh, and there's nobody from the
     <br/>
     Defense out there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante
     <br/>
     up. Both turn to Alvin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     What are you lookin' at? You think
     <br/>
     you're bad?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop.
     <br/>
     Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby,
     <br/>
     holds him back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     (vaguely sexual)
     <br/>
     Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be
     <br/>
     careful.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a
     <br/>
     long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line,
     <br/>
     leaving her breathless.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now
     <br/>
     there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody
     <br/>
     scared shitless, howling their lungs out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     This guy do this kinda shit a lot?
     <br/>
     They never mentioned this in
     <br/>
     recruiting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble
     <br/>
     back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange
     <br/>
     exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DISSOLVE TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are
     <br/>
     scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in
     <br/>
     test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts
     <br/>
     to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the
     <br/>
     clock, goes on to the next page.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a
     <br/>
     gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's
     <br/>
     still thinking about the test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I don't know... I left a lot of 'em
     <br/>
     blank.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Don't worry, you'll do all right.
     <br/>
     Lotta people don't finish.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (not convinced)
     <br/>
     Yeh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What are you doin' with the trophy?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Coach Winters asked me to bring it
     <br/>
     to the meeting. I don't know what
     <br/>
     for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I'll see ya at the meeting.
     <br/>
     (handing him the trophy)
     <br/>
     Take this for me, will ya?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing
     <br/>
     across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Hey, Autumn, hold up! What're you
     <br/>
     doing here? I thought students didn't
     <br/>
     come back for two weeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (rather coolly)
     <br/>
     I came back early to see a friend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNEL
     <br/>
     You're looking fresh, Autumn. A
     <br/>
     package of pulchritudiness. What
     <br/>
     about getting together later tonight?
     <br/>
     Maybe get a pizza? They got pizza in
     <br/>
     this town don't they?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I can't tonight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     How about tomorrow night?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I don't think it's a real good idea
     <br/>
     for us to see each other, Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     What's the matter? I'm not good enough
     <br/>
     for you all of a sudden? Too young,
     <br/>
     is that it? I'm not, ya know. They
     <br/>
     held me back a year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     No, it's not that... I've got a
     <br/>
     boyfriend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Did you have this boyfriend when you
     <br/>
     showed me around?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (reluctant to admit
     <br/>
     it)
     <br/>
     Yes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother
     <br/>
     you then. I'm willing to overlook it
     <br/>
     now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I was mad at him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     For what?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I caught him with another girl. A
     <br/>
     white girl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     And you're still with this nigger?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She nods, slightly embarrassed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Look, I got to get going, Darnell.
     <br/>
     I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you
     <br/>
     on. I'm glad you came here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She starts walking away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Wait a minute. I can at least walk
     <br/>
     with you, can't I? Nothin' wrong
     <br/>
     with that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She speeds up. He speeds up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I'm in a hurry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I can keep up. I run the forty in
     <br/>
     four-four.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She's just about to say something when RAY GRIFFEN arrives.
     <br/>
     Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut,
     <br/>
     well-spoken, middle class.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     Hey, Autumn --
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen. Ray and
     <br/>
     Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Hi, Ray. This is...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (cutting in, offering
     <br/>
     his hand)
     <br/>
     Darnell Jefferson.
     <br/>
     (pointedly)
     <br/>
     Tailback.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     (shaking Darnell's
     <br/>
     hand)
     <br/>
     Ray Griffen.
     <br/>
     (just as pointedly)
     <br/>
     Starting tailback.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I know. That's why they recruited
     <br/>
     me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn can't believe he said this. She starts to interject
     <br/>
     something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     The two guys they recruited before
     <br/>
     you are handing out Gatorade now.
     <br/>
     (making the jerkoff
     <br/>
     motion)
     <br/>
     Better start strengthening your wrist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     We'll see.
     <br/>
     (departing, to Ray)
     <br/>
     Give my best to Miss Lilly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn's mortification is complete.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     (to himself)
     <br/>
     What the hell is that supposed to
     <br/>
     mean?
     <br/>

     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY

     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. KELLER CENTER - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The
     <br/>
     Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking
     <br/>
     very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U.
     <br/>
     greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation
     <br/>
     punctuated with laughter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes
     <br/>
     immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break
     <br/>
     into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join
     <br/>
     in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Good to see you again, gentlemen.
     <br/>
     (catching sight of
     <br/>
     Darnell)
     <br/>
     Jefferson, either take off the earring
     <br/>
     or put on a dress.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off
     <br/>
     his earring.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I wanna talk a little about what
     <br/>
     we're trying to do here. There are
     <br/>
     many highly respected people who
     <br/>
     feel football is about preparation
     <br/>
     for life.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of
     <br/>
     the football cannon.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     These people are full of shit. You
     <br/>
     see, football is not like life.
     <br/>
     (pause)
     <br/>
     It's better. More exciting, more
     <br/>
     intense, more fun. In life, people
     <br/>
     are always wondering how they measure
     <br/>
     up; whether they're getting ahead or
     <br/>
     fallin' behind. In football, you
     <br/>
     know. Every week you get a chance to
     <br/>
     show what you're made of, a chance
     <br/>
     to demonstrate the physical and
     <br/>
     personal qualities that all those
     <br/>
     poor bastards who can't play this
     <br/>
     game are left to agonize about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football
     <br/>
     player.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Last year we didn't make enough of
     <br/>
     those chances. Last year everyone
     <br/>
     felt we let the school down. Fuck
     <br/>
     the school. We let ourselves down.
     <br/>
     (pointing to the Wall
     <br/>
     of Honor)
     <br/>
     We let down a great tradition, a 120-
     <br/>
     year-old Line of Champions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger,
     <br/>
     retribution.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Any football program worth the name
     <br/>
     is a special brotherhood, an elite
     <br/>
     corps of warriors, a select group of
     <br/>
     knights. That first time our starting
     <br/>
     unit takes the field, the first time
     <br/>
     we huddle up; that's our inner circle,
     <br/>
     that's our Round Table. If I were an
     <br/>
     upperclassman, I'd be real nervous
     <br/>
     about my seat, cause we got some
     <br/>
     very talented new-comers this year.
     <br/>
     Guys who want a place at the Table.
     <br/>
     (producing Darnell's
     <br/>
     trophy from behind
     <br/>
     the podium)
     <br/>
     This is the trophy one of our
     <br/>
     freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as
     <br/>
     a Pennsylvania State High School
     <br/>
     First Team All-American. You know
     <br/>
     what this says to me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The freshmen are hanging on every word.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Not a god-damn thing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half,
     <br/>
     shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog.
     <br/>
     The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (to the freshmen)
     <br/>
     Everybody here was a high school All-
     <br/>
     American.
     <br/>
     (to all the players)
     <br/>
     Whatever any of you have done before
     <br/>
     is out the window. We're startin'
     <br/>
     over. Ground zero. The Table is empty.
     <br/>
     Are you ready?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the
     <br/>
     freshmen. They're not so sure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SMASH CUT TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Passing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws
     <br/>
     an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head.
     <br/>
     Joe's angry with himself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COACH CLAYTON
     <br/>
     (to Winters)
     <br/>
     He's too pumped up. Tryin' to win
     <br/>
     the damn Heisman on every throw. I'm
     <br/>
     not sure he's ready for all this
     <br/>
     hype.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COACH HUMES
     <br/>
     Little late to be worryin' about
     <br/>
     that. If we don't follow up the Sports
     <br/>
     Illustrated cover with something,
     <br/>
     it'll look like we didn't believe in
     <br/>
     our own player.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't worry, Joe's a tough kid. He'll
     <br/>
     be allright.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts
     <br/>
     it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken
     <br/>
     field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back,
     <br/>
     eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin,
     <br/>
     pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping
     <br/>
     the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the
     <br/>
     fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense
     <br/>
     recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground,
     <br/>
     the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his
     <br/>
     place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     GRIFFEN
     <br/>
     Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You
     <br/>
     got all the moves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (shouting to the team)
     <br/>
     Allright, move it up. Let's go, 15
     <br/>
     yards, run the next play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind.
     <br/>
     Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Cut the necktie tackle horseshit.
     <br/>
     You think you're in some kinda
     <br/>
     highlight reel? He left you huggin'
     <br/>
     air. Target his guts. Drive right
     <br/>
     through his abdomen. I wanta see
     <br/>
     snot bubbles in his nose. I wanta
     <br/>
     see shit in his underwear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on
     <br/>
     Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (gasping)
     <br/>
     What do you mean?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     If you're hurt, you can still play.
     <br/>
     If you're injured you can't. Are you
     <br/>
     hurt or are you injured?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I think I'm just hurt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     O.k., then get up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters extends a hand. Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily
     <br/>
     to his feet
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Nice run. Think what it coulda done
     <br/>
     for us if we still had the ball.
     <br/>
     (handing him the ball)
     <br/>
     This is a football. I want you to
     <br/>
     carry it with you wherever you go.
     <br/>
     Never let it out of your sight.
     <br/>
     (to the rest of the
     <br/>
     team)
     <br/>
     Any of you see him on campus, take a
     <br/>
     swipe at the ball. Try to knock it
     <br/>
     out of his hands. Recover it.
     <br/>
     (to Darnell again)
     <br/>
     If anybody, but you, returns this
     <br/>
     ball to me, you'll wish you'de never
     <br/>
     been born.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters wheels off leaving a wobbly Darnell alone with his
     <br/>
     football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS (V.O.)
     <br/>
     This isn't gonna get it, goddamnit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WINTER'S OFFICE, LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who
     <br/>
     are sitting, cowed in his office.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I see tackling, but I don't see
     <br/>
     hitting. I see effort, but I don't
     <br/>
     see ferocity. What do you think,
     <br/>
     they're gonna motivate themselves?
     <br/>
     Football's just a game to most of
     <br/>
     these kids. This is our program, our
     <br/>
     livelihood. It's our job to make
     <br/>
     them care as much about it as we do.
     <br/>
     Make them hate me if you have to.
     <br/>
     It'll bring them together, give them
     <br/>
     a focus. So get off your butts and
     <br/>
     put the fear of God in these guys.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Dead tired players toweling off, dressing. The trainer's
     <br/>
     room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players.
     <br/>
     Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight
     <br/>
     room. Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters'
     <br/>
     office.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Shit, Lattimer's an animal all of a
     <br/>
     sudden. Benchin' 450. He's gotta be
     <br/>
     on somethin'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HUMES
     <br/>
     What, steroids? Why do you always
     <br/>
     think my guys are juicin'?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     I don't know... he's on the punt
     <br/>
     team for three years, then gains 35
     <br/>
     pounds of rip in one summer and an
     <br/>
     attitude to go with it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters, who's heard all this, comes by.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     We're not doctors, gentlemen. The
     <br/>
     NCAA has testing programs for this.
     <br/>
     Let's let them worry about it.
     <br/>
     (to Clayton)
     <br/>
     Besides, it's not that hard to put
     <br/>
     on 35 pounds in a summer, if you
     <br/>
     really hit the gym.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters walks on into his office. Clayton nods, realizing
     <br/>
     this subject is now closed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. DARNELL'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles
     <br/>
     to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying
     <br/>
     there is his PENNSYLVANIA STATE ALL AMERICAN TROPHY. Coach
     <br/>
     Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on
     <br/>
     Darnell's tired face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. TRAINING TABLE DINING ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For football players only. Bud Lite moves through the
     <br/>
     cafeteria line.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     What you got tonight?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAFETERIA WORKER
     <br/>
     Choice of three entrees. Shrimp,
     <br/>
     lasagna, T-bone steak.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Tough choice. I'll take all three.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAFETERIA WORKER
     <br/>
     What a surprise.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON DARNELL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     at another table with Alvin and several other black players.
     <br/>
     Lattimer is the only white.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     When do they give ya the scores on
     <br/>
     that Placement Test?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Who cares? I flunked it three times,
     <br/>
     before I got in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Long as you're in the program, they'll
     <br/>
     get you through. Maybe not with a
     <br/>
     degree, but they'll keep you eligible.
     <br/>
     Just don't do nothin' embarrassing
     <br/>
     they can't cover you for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Hell, they even give Alvin copies of
     <br/>
     his tests in advance. He sells 'em
     <br/>
     for a hundred bucks a pop to people
     <br/>
     in his class. 'Course he's gotta
     <br/>
     have somebody read 'em to him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Fuck you, doughboy. I can read. See
     <br/>
     that shoe?
     <br/>
     (points to his shoes)
     <br/>
     That says Nike.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I still don't wanna flunk that test.
     <br/>
     I wanta get a degree.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     What do you think, nigger? You're
     <br/>
     gonna be on the Supreme Court? All
     <br/>
     you need to know is how to sign an
     <br/>
     N.F.L. contract.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as
     <br/>
     capable of more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise
     <br/>
     visitor to the training table. All the players wearing
     <br/>
     baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What's the matter with you guys?
     <br/>
     You're supposed to be a team. Winning
     <br/>
     depends on thinking and acting and
     <br/>
     going to war together. But you don't
     <br/>
     even eat like a team. You eat like
     <br/>
     two teams. A white one and a black
     <br/>
     one. What do I have to do? Make out
     <br/>
     a seating chart? Now get up. Move
     <br/>
     around. Mix it up. Now!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up
     <br/>
     and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (mock introduction)
     <br/>
     Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I'm a
     <br/>
     young black man.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane,
     <br/>
     Caucasian. So what doya think a that
     <br/>
     new Garth Brooks album?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I love that motherfucker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables
     <br/>
     are integrated now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     That's more like it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to
     <br/>
     drift back to their old tables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various
     <br/>
     aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out
     <br/>
     of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and
     <br/>
     looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE
     <br/>
     SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage
     <br/>
     of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe
     <br/>
     leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     How ya' doin'?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Fine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Little late to be workin' out, isn't
     <br/>
     it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (with a little edge)
     <br/>
     Only time I could get in here when
     <br/>
     the football team wasn't usin' it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (trying to get a rise
     <br/>
     out of her)
     <br/>
     Well, if it wasn't for the football
     <br/>
     team, might not be a weight room to
     <br/>
     use. You tryin' to firm up a little,
     <br/>
     or what?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (unfazed)
     <br/>
     Don't need to firm up. I'm
     <br/>
     strengthening my knee. Had
     <br/>
     arthroscopic surgery.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Had my knee scoped once too. When
     <br/>
     you're finished here, maybe we could
     <br/>
     get a yogurt, compare scars.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Sorry, I don't date football players.
     <br/>
     They're all full of themselves. I
     <br/>
     saw you on the cover of Sports
     <br/>
     Illustrated, so you're probably worse
     <br/>
     than most.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     That's real open minded of you. So
     <br/>
     you won't consider doin' anything
     <br/>
     with me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     No.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Well at least tell me what happened
     <br/>
     to your knee. What'd you do? Fall
     <br/>
     outa your convertible?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's
     <br/>
     going to fire on him. Wrong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You know, there's maybe one thing
     <br/>
     I'd do with you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What's that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Tennis. I'll play tennis with you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille starts to walk away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Tennis. You mean now? It's raining.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SMASH CUT TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with
     <br/>
     the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a
     <br/>
     world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting
     <br/>
     every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins
     <br/>
     watch, amazed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless
     <br/>
     dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the
     <br/>
     line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting
     <br/>
     a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return.
     <br/>
     Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends
     <br/>
     it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving
     <br/>
     again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille
     <br/>
     puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost
     <br/>
     knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence.
     <br/>
     Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Thanks for the game, Heisman. You
     <br/>
     took it really well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her,
     <br/>
     pissed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What's this Heisman crap?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I didn't say anything about being a
     <br/>
     Heisman candidate. I don't go around
     <br/>
     strokin' myself about it. So what's
     <br/>
     this shit you're givin' me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I... I'm sorry... I just figured you
     <br/>
     were probably kissin' yourself in
     <br/>
     the mirror every morning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     You figured wrong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     So what do you want, an apology? I
     <br/>
     just gave you one.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I want a rematch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     A rematch?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Some other sport. I took my beating.
     <br/>
     You owe me one. Either that or we go
     <br/>
     out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike
     <br/>
     least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I'll think about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks
     <br/>
     off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     Real good date, Joe. Remind me to
     <br/>
     take her out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FADE OUT:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FADE IN:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Opening day of school. We take CUTS of students arriving,
     <br/>
     football players checking out the new girls from atop the
     <br/>
     wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting
     <br/>
     returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for
     <br/>
     classes etc.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ADVISOR SMITH
     <br/>
     Darnell, I've reviewed your placement
     <br/>
     test and I'm afraid you failed to
     <br/>
     meet our entrance requirements in
     <br/>
     two areas.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     What does that mean? I can't play
     <br/>
     football?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ADVISOR SMITH
     <br/>
     No. It means you're going to have to
     <br/>
     take some remedial classes, what we
     <br/>
     call "zero level" courses.
     <br/>
     Specifically Math 0 and English 0.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of
     <br/>
     his academic standing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ADVISOR SMITH
     <br/>
     You won't get college credit for
     <br/>
     them, but they will help you prepare
     <br/>
     to take the Placement Test again at
     <br/>
     the end of the quarter. If you pass
     <br/>
     at that time you'll be able to
     <br/>
     officially enter the university and
     <br/>
     take college level courses. You'll
     <br/>
     still be able to take an American
     <br/>
     History survey course, but it won't
     <br/>
     count on your record until you pass
     <br/>
     the Placement Test. But first things
     <br/>
     first. To start, I'm approving a
     <br/>
     tutor for you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     A tutor? I don't need no tutor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ADVISOR SMITH
     <br/>
     Any tutor. And yes you do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic
     <br/>
     Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the
     <br/>
     Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also
     <br/>
     present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center
     <br/>
     of all this attention.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     I think both Joe and the university
     <br/>
     are best served by a straightforward
     <br/>
     Heisman campaign. Nothing too
     <br/>
     gimmicky.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER
     <br/>
     We've compiled a mailing list of
     <br/>
     around 1300 opinion makers;
     <br/>
     newspapers, football writers, and
     <br/>
     sports anchors. First we send them a
     <br/>
     packet on Joe and his achievements.
     <br/>
     Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff;
     <br/>
     commitment to academics, charity
     <br/>
     work, etc. Then we update it each
     <br/>
     week with a postcard. Heisman voters
     <br/>
     hate opening envelopes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I haven't really done any charity
     <br/>
     work...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER
     <br/>
     You're gonna start. We've got some
     <br/>
     things lined up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NICHOLS
     <br/>
     Unfortunately, because we weren't in
     <br/>
     the top 20 last year, we only have
     <br/>
     one network T.V. game to give Joe
     <br/>
     national exposure. Although it's a
     <br/>
     good one; Michigan. But we'll also
     <br/>
     be taping all our other games and
     <br/>
     buying satellite time. That way we
     <br/>
     can produce our own highlight package
     <br/>
     and interview pieces and send them
     <br/>
     out to T.V. stations all over the
     <br/>
     country for their sportscasts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Any questions, Joe?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not
     <br/>
     to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign?
     <br/>
     Still it's a megaton of pressure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Ah, no... I just... you really think
     <br/>
     I got a shot to win this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing
     <br/>
     for the program. Publicizes the
     <br/>
     school, gives a boost to recruiting,
     <br/>
     and it's a great thing for you. Jumps
     <br/>
     up your draft position, the size of
     <br/>
     your first contract, everything.
     <br/>
     It's a hell of an opportunity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NICHOLS
     <br/>
     All you gotta do is back it up on
     <br/>
     the field, and we have no doubts
     <br/>
     about that, cause we know "Kane is
     <br/>
     Able."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase
     <br/>
     "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a
     <br/>
     rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about
     <br/>
     all this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE KANE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to
     <br/>
     get to sleep.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMILLE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and
     <br/>
     answers it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Hello...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON JOE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (still drowsy)
     <br/>
     What?
     <br/>
     (looking at the clock)
     <br/>
     It's 3:00 in the morning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I wanta know what you decided.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I don't know... I couldn't think of
     <br/>
     any other sports I could beat you
     <br/>
     at.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Then I'll pick you up tonight at
     <br/>
     6:00.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He hangs up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     What?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She
     <br/>
     becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see
     <br/>
     Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Hey, Autumn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya
     <br/>
     know, just to get me over a couple
     <br/>
     rough spots.
     <br/>
     (showing her a paper)
     <br/>
     I saw your name on this list. I
     <br/>
     figured if you couldn't keep my
     <br/>
     attention, nobody could.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I'm sorry, Darnell, but I've already
     <br/>
     been assigned. You're gonna have to
     <br/>
     find somebody else. I'm tutoring
     <br/>
     Scott Sherman.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters
     <br/>
     to switch us.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Coach Winters wouldn't do that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh he would. I'm a bigger prospect
     <br/>
     than Sherman.
     <br/>
     (pointing across the
     <br/>
     way)
     <br/>
     He's a lineman on the scout team.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough,
     <br/>
     SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn
     <br/>
     can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell sits down across the table from her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     C'mon Autumn, you could teach me
     <br/>
     some real erudition.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (trying to whisper,
     <br/>
     pissed)
     <br/>
     Will you stop using those big words.
     <br/>
     It sounds ridiculous.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (serious about this)
     <br/>
     What doya mean? I'm improvin' myself.
     <br/>
     I learn a new word out of the
     <br/>
     dictionary every day. Mendacious,
     <br/>
     pejorative, antithetical,
     <br/>
     commensurate...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     And you don't ever use them right.
     <br/>
     Pretending to be smart is not the
     <br/>
     same as being educated. Or erudite.
     <br/>
     It's just a con. And it makes you
     <br/>
     sound stupid, no matter how big a
     <br/>
     prospect you are.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His
     <br/>
     customary bravado melts away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     O.K... even more reason for you to
     <br/>
     be my tutor. You already taught me
     <br/>
     something.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal.
     <br/>
     She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having
     <br/>
     trouble being angry about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN MACK
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR
     <br/>
     reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman
     <br/>
     and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She
     <br/>
     stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on
     <br/>
     his Harley.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     We goin' on that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I promised my dad I'd never get on
     <br/>
     one of those.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What are you, one of these trust-
     <br/>
     fund princesses? It's fine for me to
     <br/>
     play a game I don't know, but I ask
     <br/>
     you to try somethin' different and
     <br/>
     you hide behind your daddy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She
     <br/>
     burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her
     <br/>
     to decline this challenge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (snatching the helmet)
     <br/>
     All right. But we go slow. No cowboy
     <br/>
     stuff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they
     <br/>
     roar off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at
     <br/>
     moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we
     <br/>
     can tell she's enjoying it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     This speed, o.k.?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Yeh, fine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Good.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back.
     <br/>
     Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed
     <br/>
     away from camera.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Slow down, damnit. Joe... Joe!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be
     <br/>
     a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles
     <br/>
     devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're
     <br/>
     heading straight for the edge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (freaked)
     <br/>
     Joe, look out!!!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of
     <br/>
     the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille
     <br/>
     screaming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CUT TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON HARLEY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road,
     <br/>
     three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to
     <br/>
     a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille
     <br/>
     jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     How could you do that, you stupid
     <br/>
     punk? It isn't funny, god-dammit,
     <br/>
     you coulda killed us! You're crazy,
     <br/>
     you know that...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Take it easy. I've done that a hundred
     <br/>
     times. No big deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (embarrassed)
     <br/>
     I don't know... I guess cause I've
     <br/>
     never done it with someone else on
     <br/>
     the bike.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You just wanted to scare me. Are you
     <br/>
     happy now?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was
     <br/>
     even better than I thought it'd be.
     <br/>
     Every dog within hearing distance
     <br/>
     wants to mate with you now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her
     <br/>
     ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the
     <br/>
     distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry,
     <br/>
     but amused in spite of herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do
     <br/>
     You Love" on the jukebox. Camille and Joe are sitting in a
     <br/>
     booth. Joe putting away the beers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You come here a lot?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Now and then. Why?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     It's not exactly a campus favorite.
     <br/>
     This is almost like hidin' out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I like places where nobody knows me.
     <br/>
     This too low-rent for you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     No, my dad owned a place like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Your dad? You mean he owned a chain
     <br/>
     of these?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Not everybody with a Southern accent
     <br/>
     has their own plantation. My dad
     <br/>
     could never afford to send me here.
     <br/>
     I learned to play tennis on public
     <br/>
     courts. Mighta been able to play pro
     <br/>
     someday, if I hadn't hurt my knee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     So you're just a scholarship jock
     <br/>
     like me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Yeh. You disappointed?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No, I've just never been out with a
     <br/>
     jock before.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Is that what we're doin' here? Goin'
     <br/>
     out?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I don't know. What doya think?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet.
     <br/>
     They dance to a slow song.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I think you're crazy for jeopardizing
     <br/>
     your scholarship and a pro future by
     <br/>
     jumping motorcycles off of highways.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Just tryin' to keep my edge, Camille.
     <br/>
     The other guys look to me cause they
     <br/>
     think I'll do anything. I lose that,
     <br/>
     I'm just another guy, and we all get
     <br/>
     our ass kicked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I don't know, Joe. You scare me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ATHLETIC DORM GARAGE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe roars in on his motorcycle. Parks. Starts inside. Finds
     <br/>
     himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters.
     <br/>
     Winters holds out his hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     The keys.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his
     <br/>
     motorcycle keys.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I told you, as long as you're in
     <br/>
     this program, you don't take
     <br/>
     unnecessary risks off the field. A
     <br/>
     man in contention for the Heisman
     <br/>
     Trophy should be able to remember
     <br/>
     that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe nods, contrite. Winters just walks on off.
     <br/>

     INT. STUDY HALL - CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

     Autumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes.

     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     O.K., using the things we worked on
     <br/>
     yesterday, I want you to write a two
     <br/>
     or three page essay on some aspect
     <br/>
     of your life. Something other than
     <br/>
     football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Like what?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Your father, maybe. You could write
     <br/>
     about your dad.

     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Don't know that much about him. He
     <br/>
     was off in Detroit workin' in a car
     <br/>
     plant when I was born. Got laid off,
     <br/>
     tried to rob a jewelry store to get
     <br/>
     us some money. He died in prison.
     <br/>
     Some kinda heart problem.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to
     <br/>
     press on gamely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     How about your mother?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     She was always workin'. Usually two
     <br/>
     jobs. Comin' home one night she
     <br/>
     stopped to get us some root beer.
     <br/>
     Got caught in a gang crossfire. Shot
     <br/>
     three times... died on the way to
     <br/>
     the hospital. You want me to write
     <br/>
     about that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (blown away)
     <br/>
     No...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Good, 'cause none of it's true.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn jumps up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (raising her voice)
     <br/>
     Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible
     <br/>
     thing to do to somebody. That's not
     <br/>
     funny. That's sick.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Had ya goin', didn't I?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (soft library voice)
     <br/>
     No you didn't. You just... How could
     <br/>
     you make up somethin' like that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (contrite now)
     <br/>
     Sounded more interesting than the
     <br/>
     truth. My mom took a vacation to
     <br/>
     Chicago when I was 12. Never came
     <br/>
     back. Don't know who my dad was.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Who took care of you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I started hangin' with the J.B.M.,
     <br/>
     gang-bangin'... Did some time in the
     <br/>
     Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin'
     <br/>
     football on a juvenile probation
     <br/>
     team. Took me in, got me into high
     <br/>
     school. Only reason they accepted me
     <br/>
     was 'cause I could play football.
     <br/>
     Sorta like here. Football saved my
     <br/>
     life. I'd be nowhere without football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Well, then... maybe you could write
     <br/>
     about football this once.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh, o.k... thanks.
     <br/>
     (pause)
     <br/>
     I've seen a lotta shitty things in
     <br/>
     my life, Autumn. That's why I know
     <br/>
     when I see somethin' good.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn knows this is no line. He means it. She's seeing him
     <br/>
     with new eyes. Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity,
     <br/>
     and more than a little taken by his regard for her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON ALVIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     across the room with his tutor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TUTOR
     <br/>
     Let's review the chapter I read you
     <br/>
     yesterday. Which two city states
     <br/>
     fought in the Punic Wars?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TUTOR
     <br/>
     C'mon, Alvin. You're gonna be tested
     <br/>
     on this.

     INT. FOOTBALL MEETING - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A video projector projects various football formations on
     <br/>
     the wall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi
     <br/>
     State's offensive set. 2nd and 2 on
     <br/>
     our 24. What defense are you in?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set
     <br/>
     back shifts into the I.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Good.
     <br/>
     (slide changes)
     <br/>
     How about here? 3rd and 7.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN

     Okie. Thunder. Lion.

     What's your assignment?

     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Kill the Quarterback.

     <br/>
     Kill everybody.

     MUSIC UP - MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in
     <br/>
     and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports
     <br/>
     Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to
     <br/>
     muster some enthusiasm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math
     <br/>
     book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn
     <br/>
     quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw
     <br/>
     Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A group of football players sits in the back of the class.
     <br/>
     As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell
     <br/>
     furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity,
     <br/>
     leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football
     <br/>
     out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other
     <br/>
     FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats,
     <br/>
     scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other
     <br/>
     students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under
     <br/>
     chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball.
     <br/>
     Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it.
     <br/>
     He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof
     <br/>
     looks at Darnell aghast.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Sorry... I lost my football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. RAQUETBALL COURT - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball.
     <br/>
     Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a
     <br/>
     fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket
     <br/>
     and stomps around.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on
     <br/>
     a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he
     <br/>
     begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the
     <br/>
     ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell
     <br/>
     winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a
     <br/>
     beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss
     <br/>
     him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her
     <br/>
     books.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board
     <br/>
     in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been
     <br/>
     posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation
     <br/>
     TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes,
     <br/>
     obviously disappointed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He
     <br/>
     finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching
     <br/>
     the air, he dashes out of the building.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the
     <br/>
     table. Whooo!! Yes!!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins
     <br/>
     head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and
     <br/>
     yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from
     <br/>
     across the street. He knows there's something dark at work
     <br/>
     here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team
     <br/>
     before the game Saturday. Make sure
     <br/>
     Lattimer knows about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC AND MONTAGE END
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a
     <br/>
     circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters
     <br/>
     addresses the assembly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     As the veteran players know, we have
     <br/>
     Pride Night every year before our
     <br/>
     opening game. It's a chance to get
     <br/>
     to know each other better, share
     <br/>
     some thoughts, and bring us closer
     <br/>
     together as a team. So to start off,
     <br/>
     I'd like each player to tell the
     <br/>
     others in his group what he likes
     <br/>
     best about football and then what
     <br/>
     he's most proud of off the field.
     <br/>
     I've asked some of the seniors to
     <br/>
     lead it off. Gentlemen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON LATTIMER IN HIS CIRCLE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     I don't know... It's the battle. The
     <br/>
     goin' to war with the other guys.
     <br/>
     Hangin' together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMPUS BALLROOM - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The team walks through several plays. They wear coats and
     <br/>
     ties, but no socks. Their ankles are taped.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Bein' different from everybody else.
     <br/>
     Havin' our own dorm, stayin' in hotels
     <br/>
     the night before games. Settin'
     <br/>
     ourselves apart.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before the game. An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little
     <br/>
     test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes
     <br/>
     into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back
     <br/>
     of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours
     <br/>
     it in the test vial.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Havin' a chance to be somebody. To
     <br/>
     do somethin' that people look up to
     <br/>
     you for. Your strength and your
     <br/>
     courage. Not everybody can play
     <br/>
     football. We're the lucky ones.

     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     The thing I'm most proud of myself
     <br/>
     for?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame
     <br/>
     ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching
     <br/>
     the ball from arm to arm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Just that I'm here. That I'm not
     <br/>
     dead or in jail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     The great thing about football is
     <br/>
     you can lose yourself in it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against
     <br/>
     the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the
     <br/>
     rhythmic tapping of his feet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     There's no time to think, to worry,
     <br/>
     to have doubts. Everything else fades
     <br/>
     away. You just move and react.

     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     The best thing is when you dominate.
     <br/>
     That feeling when you hit a guy real
     <br/>
     good, really stick him, and you hear
     <br/>
     that little moan.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where
     <br/>
     Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war
     <br/>
     paint. They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his
     <br/>
     mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's.
     <br/>
     Darnell can't believe this shit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN (V.O.)
     <br/>
     You know it's killin' him, but you
     <br/>
     feel great. It's just him and you,
     <br/>
     and he's the one that's hurtin'.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and

     INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - GAME DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping
     <br/>
     pads, yelling encouragement. Winters waves them forward.
     <br/>
     They start to run down the tunnel.

     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMERA runs with the players as the light at the end of the

     tunnel becomes larger and brighter. Crowd NOISE becomes louder
     <br/>
     until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the
     <br/>
     light and 95,000 VOICES ROAR. AND ROAR! AND ROAR! This is

     HARVEY
     <br/>
     Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den
     <br/>
     where the E.S.U. Timberwolves, led
     <br/>
     by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open
     <br/>
     their season against the tough
     <br/>
     Mississippi State Bulldogs under
     <br/>
     head coach Jackie Sherrill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd stands, waving banners, as the E.S.U. kicker comes
     <br/>
     forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky. The
     <br/>
     MISSISSIPPI STATE RETURN MAN fields the ball at the four
     <br/>
     yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried. The
     <br/>
     defense trots out and huddles up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     All right, let's get evil. 60 minutes,
     <br/>
     balls out. Let's open a can of kick-
     <br/>
     ass. Kill 'em all. Let the paramedics
     <br/>
     sort 'em out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to
     <br/>
     the line of scrimmage. Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks
     <br/>
     eyes with the tailback, No.23.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hey, 23, don't think I don't recognize
     <br/>
     you, you little fuck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The tailback looks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hey, pay attention when I'm talkin'
     <br/>
     to you, nigger. You're the guy that
     <br/>
     shot my mother aren't you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAILBACK
     <br/>
     What?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     You were tryin' to steal her fuckin'
     <br/>
     car weren't you, cocksucker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TAILBACK
     <br/>
     Shut up. I never heard of your mother.
     <br/>

     On the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange.

     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>

     <br/>
     What's Alvin saying to that guy?

     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Just gettin' himself pumped up.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     He wasn't pumped up already?

     ALVIN

     ya? But I got you now nigger, and
     <br/>
     I'm gonna kill you motherfucker. I'm
     <br/>
     gonna bust your guts open and watch
     <br/>
     you die.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ball is snapped. The quarterback pitches to the tailback
     <br/>
     as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his
     <br/>
     lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away
     <br/>
     from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer. The
     <br/>
     ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with
     <br/>
     it. E.S.U. ball.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The bench and stands erupt as Lattimer and Alvin but heads
     <br/>
     and trot off the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Atta baby, Alvin, heads up. Big pop,
     <br/>
     Steve, way to stick 'em.
     <br/>
     (turning to Joe)
     <br/>
     O.K. Joe, let's go up top. Take it
     <br/>
     to 'em right away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe leads the offense on. A disappointed Darnell stands on
     <br/>
     the sidelines.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (in huddle)
     <br/>
     O.K. let's put the women and children
     <br/>
     to bed, and go lookin' for dinner.
     <br/>
     Don't let em up. 51 Strike, Orange
     <br/>
     left. On 4.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe begins to howl like a wolf. The others join in. A pack
     <br/>
     of Timberwolves. They break the huddle, come to the line of
     <br/>
     scrimmage. Bud Lite begins to sing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any
     <br/>
     day. Here am I, your special island...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud lines up opposite a big, black DEFENSIVE TACKLE.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BLACK TACKLE
     <br/>
     Shut up, snowflake. You think you're
     <br/>
     in the school play?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling.
     <br/>
     And the highway runs right over your
     <br/>
     ass.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BLACK TACKLE
     <br/>
     Bullshit, you're gonna be my bitch,
     <br/>
     baby. You gonna be my punk bitch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     (singing again)
     <br/>
     So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen,
     <br/>
     good night, I hate to go and leave
     <br/>
     this pretty sight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped. Bud Lite and
     <br/>
     the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach
     <br/>
     of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle
     <br/>
     comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping
     <br/>
     his neck back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud
     <br/>
     Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers
     <br/>
     in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The
     <br/>
     Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud
     <br/>
     rolls him over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern.
     <br/>
     Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone.
     <br/>
     Touchdown.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's
     <br/>
     throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the
     <br/>
     air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FADE THROUGH TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It reads E.S.U. 28, Mississippi State 20. 4th Quarter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Jefferson! In for Griffen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action, buttons
     <br/>
     his chinstrap, races onto the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     2:05 left. Kane hands to Jefferson...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON DARNELL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He takes a handoff, runs a trap up the middle, is hit by
     <br/>
     THREE TACKLERS, clawing at the ball. They bring him down,
     <br/>
     but Darnell doesn't fumble. He gets up, still clutching the
     <br/>
     ball, and starts back to the huddle with it. The REFEREE
     <br/>
     hustles after him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REFEREE
     <br/>
     Excuse me, son, but we're gonna need
     <br/>
     that football for another couple
     <br/>
     minutes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up. Even Winters has
     <br/>
     to laugh. We go to:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON LATTIMER
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer, sacking the quarterback, tackling him high, ripping
     <br/>
     his helmet off. Lattimer runs off the field, holding it up
     <br/>
     like a trophy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The gun sounds, the game is over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON COACH WINTERS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Accepting congratulations from his staff.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Guess we'll be on the payroll for
     <br/>
     another week.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON BUD LITE AND THE BLACK TACKLE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     walking off the field together, both their jerseys blood-
     <br/>
     stained.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     Good game, man. Really enjoyed it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BLACK TACKLE
     <br/>
     Yeh, you're a strong motherfucker.
     <br/>
     Shitty singer though.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. PENTHOUSE HOTEL SUITE - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A reception of some sort for the players is in progress.
     <br/>
     Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch
     <br/>
     bowl. A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALUMNUS
     <br/>
     Good to see ya in there, Darnell.
     <br/>
     Way to hold on to that pigskin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat
     <br/>
     pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised,
     <br/>
     he goes over to Alvin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar
     <br/>
     bill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Don't worry, you'll get 5 or 6 hundred
     <br/>
     once you're startin', depending on
     <br/>
     how you play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     But we're not supposed to get any
     <br/>
     are we?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hey, man, you can't live on $500 a
     <br/>
     month scholarship money. And the NC
     <br/>
     double assholes won't let us have
     <br/>
     jobs, so you take your money where
     <br/>
     you can get it.
     <br/>
     (taking Darnell's
     <br/>
     envelope)
     <br/>
     I'll keep it for you, till you see
     <br/>
     the light. Shit, they oughta be payin'
     <br/>
     us anyway. Athletic Department gets
     <br/>
     3 million just for goin' to a bowl
     <br/>
     game.

     INT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed
     <br/>
     in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REPORTER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     This performance today -- two
     <br/>
     touchdown passes, another you ran
     <br/>
     in. Where do you think this puts you
     <br/>
     in the Heisman race?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe hates this question. We go to the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (uncomfortable)
     <br/>
     I really have no idea. That's up to
     <br/>
     you guys.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON SCREEN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BERMAN
     <br/>
     Now let's turn to our Heisman watch.
     <br/>
     (does the pose while
     <br/>
     remaining seated)
     <br/>
     We begin with Sports Illustrated
     <br/>
     cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led
     <br/>
     his team to an impressive victory
     <br/>
     this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues
     <br/>
     to raise Kane, he may well be Able
     <br/>
     to dust off a large space on his
     <br/>
     trophy shelf. Although the real test
     <br/>
     will come in four weeks against
     <br/>
     Michigan and their Heisman hopeful,
     <br/>
     Tim Waymen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS - EVENING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BERMAN (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Michigan also won big today. Timothy,
     <br/>
     "He Could Go All The Way Men", will
     <br/>
     be looking to do so against the
     <br/>
     Timberwolves. And of course the able
     <br/>
     Kane will be looking to also. I can't
     <br/>
     wait.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMILLE'S DORM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer.
     <br/>
     Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players,
     <br/>
     their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking,
     <br/>
     celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching
     <br/>
     the action.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     I don't know, I never seem to make
     <br/>
     out at things like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     You don't make out anywhere. Or did
     <br/>
     you finally break the snatch barrier
     <br/>
     this summer?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     Fuck you, Bobby.
     <br/>
     (realizing Louanne's
     <br/>
     there)
     <br/>
     Excuse me, Louanne.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON DARNELL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on
     <br/>
     Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Forget it, nigger. No chance for you
     <br/>
     there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Why not?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Griffin's goin' to medical school.
     <br/>
     She likes that light-skinned
     <br/>
     respectable shit. You're just her
     <br/>
     ghetto toy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where
     <br/>
     Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (to Autumn)
     <br/>
     Can I have this one?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     I don't think so.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     What are you so worried about? You
     <br/>
     haven't lost your starting job yet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (turning to Ray)
     <br/>
     Just one.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance.
     <br/>
     Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them
     <br/>
     as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're
     <br/>
     just having a nice little chat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (whispering)
     <br/>
     Take it easy, Darnell. This isn't a
     <br/>
     good time to push things. You're
     <br/>
     putting me in an awkward position.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh, well, I got a little
     <br/>
     encouragement along the way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     That kiss... it was just... a kiss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn't
     <br/>
     be standing here now, everybody
     <br/>
     thinkin' I'm a stupid asshole, if I
     <br/>
     didn't know you meant it. I wanna
     <br/>
     see you, Autumn. Not in study hall.
     <br/>
     Not like your student. Like somebody
     <br/>
     to be taken seriously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I do take you seriously, Darnell,
     <br/>
     but I'm still with Ray. I can't just
     <br/>
     go paradin' around town.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I don't need to go paradin'. We'll
     <br/>
     go someplace different. Someplace
     <br/>
     nobody'll see us.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this
     <br/>
     complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     God, why am I even considering this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     (to Darnell)
     <br/>
     All caught up on your arithmetic?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12
     <br/>
     carries.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by
     <br/>
     Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off
     <br/>
     and leaves the party.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (to Bud Lite)
     <br/>
     Just what we need, a little team
     <br/>
     unity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     I'm gettin' a little sick of this
     <br/>
     asshole, Autumn. I don't like you
     <br/>
     hangin' out with him. It's
     <br/>
     embarrassing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I don't hang out with him. I tutor
     <br/>
     him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     Then have him get another tutor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I can't do that. I made a commitment
     <br/>
     to help him pass his qualifying exam.
     <br/>
     I can't bail out on him now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     What the hell difference does it
     <br/>
     makes? They'll grease him through no
     <br/>
     matter what he does. Nobody's ever
     <br/>
     gonna see his graduation. Don't tell
     <br/>
     me you're falling for this guy. He's
     <br/>
     just another gang-banger with speed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I just said I wanted to help him.
     <br/>
     What are you more afraid of, losing
     <br/>
     your girl or your position?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     Maybe you oughta think about what
     <br/>
     you're in danger of losing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Maybe I will.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party
     <br/>
     too.

     EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just
     <br/>
     staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     VOICE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     So where you wanna go?
     <br/>

     INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few
     <br/>
     of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's
     <br/>
     knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in
     <br/>
     thought.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Maybe she's out with some guy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Who? Camille? I don't think she's
     <br/>
     the type to screw around on ya. Shoot
     <br/>
     ya, maybe...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     It wouldn't be screwing around. It's
     <br/>
     not like we're going together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table
     <br/>
     across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He
     <br/>
     stares back at her. She doesn't blink.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library
     <br/>
     steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm,
     <br/>
     she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped
     <br/>
     around Joe, nuzzling him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed
     <br/>
     to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and
     <br/>
     wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get
     <br/>
     it out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and
     <br/>
     sliding, clutching on to each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     You're right, nobody would ever see
     <br/>
     us here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around
     <br/>
     the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There
     <br/>
     are few other skaters at this hour.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yes, I figure the key is to go places
     <br/>
     only white people go. Next time we'll
     <br/>
     go bowling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating
     <br/>
     it's closing time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never
     <br/>
     believed a guy who was supposed to
     <br/>
     be an athlete would skate that bad,
     <br/>
     but now I know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble
     <br/>
     over to a bench, begin to unlace.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Thanks, that was fun, sort of.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You were pretty good for the first
     <br/>
     time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Well, it's not really my first time.
     <br/>
     My dad took me skating once.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     He used to play ball for E.S.U.,
     <br/>
     didn't he?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Yeah, how'd you know that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I saw his picture on the Wall of
     <br/>
     Fame. You got his eyes. Luckily, you
     <br/>
     didn't get his thighs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to
     <br/>
     kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Make sure you mean it this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall
     <br/>
     into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone
     <br/>
     in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go
     <br/>
     out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes.
     <br/>
     Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes
     <br/>
     out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his
     <br/>
     waist. Both are surprised to see the other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     What are you doin' here?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Couldn't sleep.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I was just sweatin' out some of the
     <br/>
     beer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille just nods. Long, silent pause.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I didn't go home with her. I thought
     <br/>
     about it... but I didn't.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You drink too much.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He turns, starts toward the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Why didn't you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Why didn't I what?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Go home with her?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I don't know... I guess I figured
     <br/>
     maybe there was somethin' goin' on
     <br/>
     between you and me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then
     <br/>
     gets off the bike and walks toward him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Then why'd you pick her up in the
     <br/>
     first place?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I was drunk... I needed some company.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (angry)
     <br/>
     Company? Yeh, I can see you havin' a
     <br/>
     real far-ranging discussion with
     <br/>
     Sheri.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I mean, ya know, physical company...
     <br/>
     I was... I just needed to pounce on
     <br/>
     somebody I guess.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around
     <br/>
     Joe's waist, leaving him naked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Why can't you pounce on me? Aren't I
     <br/>
     good enough to pounce on?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's
     <br/>
     totally thrown by this reaction in her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Well, you're more conservative...
     <br/>
     classier... you're not that kinda
     <br/>
     girl...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training
     <br/>
     table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (insulted)
     <br/>
     How do you know? You've never slept
     <br/>
     with me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     What makes you think she's such a
     <br/>
     great ride?
     <br/>
     (climbing up on top
     <br/>
     of him)
     <br/>
     I'm prettier, my legs are longer...
     <br/>
     (pulling down her
     <br/>
     leotard)
     <br/>
     I've got better tits.
     <br/>
     (exasperated)
     <br/>
     Why would you go to her, when you
     <br/>
     have me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I didn't know I had you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (softer, leaning close)
     <br/>
     Well you do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his.
     <br/>
     They fall into a long, white-hot kiss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. THE TRAINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically.
     <br/>
     Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (between kisses)
     <br/>
     You shoulda looked for me at the
     <br/>
     library, or don't you ever go there?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (rolling back on top)
     <br/>
     I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political
     <br/>
     Science. I just don't go there on
     <br/>
     Saturday nights.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (rolling back on top
     <br/>
     again)
     <br/>
     I have a paper due Monday. What'de
     <br/>
     she do? Sit on your lap or just give
     <br/>
     you the nail-me stare?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Shut up, Camille.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them
     <br/>
     off the table and out of sight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. HUGE LECTURE HALL - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A
     <br/>
     T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy
     <br/>
     as the T.A. checks his chart.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     T.A.
     <br/>
     What's your name?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Bobby Collins.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     T.A.
     <br/>
     Can I see your I.D.?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Louanne knows she's in deep trouble.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH'S VIDEO ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to
     <br/>
     run simultaneous views of different positions during the
     <br/>
     same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches
     <br/>
     approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the
     <br/>
     images on the screen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Coach, we, ah... got a problem with
     <br/>
     Bobby Collins.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Yeh...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     He talked... a friend... into taking
     <br/>
     a test for him and got caught. They
     <br/>
     had a new T.A. in there...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What's the penalty?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Well, the rules say automatic
     <br/>
     expulsion for both of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Fortunately, we've got friends on
     <br/>
     the Board of Regents. I think we can
     <br/>
     beat this if we really go to bat for
     <br/>
     him. We got Mack off when he turned
     <br/>
     in that other guys term paper.
     <br/>
     (shaking his head)
     <br/>
     But what kinda idiot would do
     <br/>
     something like that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Well, I guess Bobby figured he was
     <br/>
     gonna flunk...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I don't mean Bobby. I mean what kinda
     <br/>
     guy would be dumb enough to take a
     <br/>
     test for him?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Uh, well... it wasn't a guy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     A girl? Typical Collins. He must
     <br/>
     have banged her until she couldn't
     <br/>
     think straight. Who was it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     (barely able to get
     <br/>
     it out)
     <br/>
     It was... Louanne.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters' face goes dead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTERS' DEN - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so
     <br/>
     stupid?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     I... he was behind, he needed help.
     <br/>
     I'm sorry. I just...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Sorry! You're sorry! You've destroyed
     <br/>
     my credibility at the University, my
     <br/>
     authority with the players... Christ,
     <br/>
     it looks like I'm running a dirty
     <br/>
     program. And Collins of all people!
     <br/>
     What the hell's the matter with you,
     <br/>
     Louanne?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     (crying)
     <br/>
     I don't know... I thought he... loved
     <br/>
     me...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Loved you? He loves anything that
     <br/>
     winks back, the little rat bastard.
     <br/>
     And what are you gonna do for school
     <br/>
     now? I use my influence to get you
     <br/>
     back in, it'll stink to high hell.
     <br/>
     The press'll crucify me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     I'll get in someplace.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     God, Louanne, I told you to stay
     <br/>
     away from my players. That was my
     <br/>
     cardinal rule, stay away from the
     <br/>
     damn players...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     They've always been good enough for
     <br/>
     you. Good enough to devote your life
     <br/>
     to. Why aren't they good enough for
     <br/>
     me? Or are they too good?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You're changing the subject, Louanne.
     <br/>
     We're talkin' about you breakin' the
     <br/>
     rules.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Didn't you ever break the rules just
     <br/>
     a little? Didn't you tell me once
     <br/>
     that 90 per cent of the schools obey
     <br/>
     the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per
     <br/>
     cent go to bowl games? Was that just
     <br/>
     a joke?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his
     <br/>
     eyes and slumps down on the couch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms
     <br/>
     in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected
     <br/>
     test down in front of him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     You seen this? You got a D on your
     <br/>
     math test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had
     <br/>
     some trouble on this last part...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     We went over that last week, Darnell.
     <br/>
     What is this time we spend in here?
     <br/>
     Just a joke to you? I don't even
     <br/>
     think you've been listening to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     I've been listening to you, baby...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Don't call me baby. I thought you
     <br/>
     wanted to learn. But if all you wanta
     <br/>
     do is fake your way through, then
     <br/>
     get another tutor to waste time with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good
     <br/>
     time, and now you're gettin' all
     <br/>
     nuts behind this. It's just one test.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     So far, it's the only test. I want
     <br/>
     you to study this whole chapter. By
     <br/>
     yourself, without me here. When I
     <br/>
     come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready
     <br/>
     to do problems based on it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Whatever you say, Teach.
     <br/>
     (big grin)
     <br/>
     I don't wish to be cast in a
     <br/>
     pejorative light, so I'm dedicating
     <br/>
     myself to achieving on a level more
     <br/>
     commensurate with my abilities.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He
     <br/>
     looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's
     <br/>
     embarrassed and deeply worried.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's
     <br/>
     strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a
     <br/>
     BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately
     <br/>
     the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     Coach'd probably shoot ya lower.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is
     <br/>
     Coach Winters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding
     <br/>
     his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to
     <br/>
     hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at
     <br/>
     Bobby a beat, then.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You all played a fine game on
     <br/>
     Saturday. Take the day off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain
     <br/>
     silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs
     <br/>
     and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her
     <br/>
     things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs
     <br/>
     her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek.
     <br/>
     Hits the floor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks
     <br/>
     on Coach Winter's door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     C'mon in, Collins.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters
     <br/>
     doesn't invite him to sit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOBBY
     <br/>
     Listen, Coach, I just want you to
     <br/>
     know I'm really sorry about this
     <br/>
     whole thing with Louanne. I was real
     <br/>
     glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to
     <br/>
     junior college here...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (cutting him off)
     <br/>
     Shut up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby does. Instantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I could easily take your case to the
     <br/>
     Board of Regents. You've had no prior
     <br/>
     infractions and I could argue that
     <br/>
     you were under abnormal pressure.
     <br/>
     (pause)
     <br/>
     But I won't. You embarrassed me, you
     <br/>
     embarrassed my family, you embarrassed
     <br/>
     the program. As of now, you are no
     <br/>
     longer a member of this university
     <br/>
     or it's football team. Clean out
     <br/>
     your locker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief.
     <br/>
     There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally,
     <br/>
     dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's
     <br/>
     more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and
     <br/>
     his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes
     <br/>
     applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches
     <br/>
     like a hawk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN
     <br/>
     (to his cameraman)
     <br/>
     We ready, Jerry? O.K., let's mark
     <br/>
     it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN
     <br/>
     Joe, this game is being billed as a
     <br/>
     potential "Heisman Shootout". Did
     <br/>
     you feel any added pressure this
     <br/>
     week...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as
     <br/>
     Joe goes through passing drills.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN (V.O.)
     <br/>
     ...knowing that you're going head to
     <br/>
     head with Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY, THE PRESENT AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Well, ya know, you try to block it
     <br/>
     out, but it's basically impossible...
     <br/>
     Everybody seems to be talkin' about
     <br/>
     it, all the newspapers, the
     <br/>
     interviews...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. T.V. STUDIO - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is being interviewed by DALLAS PERRY on a local television
     <br/>
     show.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     The hype on T.V., tryin' to get
     <br/>
     somethin' goin...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera,
     <br/>
     waves off the take.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER
     <br/>
     Hold it! Hold it!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN
     <br/>
     What?! What's the problem?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER
     <br/>
     What you're saying is true, of course,
     <br/>
     but I don't think it's the message
     <br/>
     you want to send.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video
     <br/>
     spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     It makes you seem a little nervous.
     <br/>
     Like the pressure might be getting
     <br/>
     to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BRAVER
     <br/>
     This game is nationally televised,
     <br/>
     so most Heisman voters will be
     <br/>
     watching. I think a more casual
     <br/>
     approach is better. Modest,
     <br/>
     controlled, casual.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN
     <br/>
     (to Braver, irritated)
     <br/>
     We all set now?
     <br/>
     (gets a nod)
     <br/>
     Let's mark it.
     <br/>
     (the take is marked)
     <br/>
     Joe, this game is being billed as a
     <br/>
     potential "Heisman Shootout."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. QUAD - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body
     <br/>
     has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The
     <br/>
     cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the
     <br/>
     crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SWANN (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Did you feel any added pressure this
     <br/>
     week, knowing that you're going head
     <br/>
     to head with Heisman rival, Tim
     <br/>
     Waymen?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe",
     <br/>
     they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly
     <br/>
     embarrassed by it all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No, I don't really think too much
     <br/>
     about that kinda thing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad
     <br/>
     tracks below. Neither says anything. Joe seems strangely
     <br/>
     preoccupied. Camille decides to break the silence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Your parents comin' to the game
     <br/>
     tomorrow?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     My mom's dead. My dad has never seen
     <br/>
     me play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Why not?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Guess he's not that interested in
     <br/>
     football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     But you're one of the best players
     <br/>
     in the country.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (snapping)
     <br/>
     He's just not into it, o.k.?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (chastised)
     <br/>
     O.k.
     <br/>
     (silence)
     <br/>
     What's goin' on, Joe? You ask me out
     <br/>
     here, like you wanta talk about
     <br/>
     somethin', then you don't say
     <br/>
     anything. You worried about tomorrow?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No... I'm worried about the days
     <br/>
     after that. I just. I don't know...
     <br/>
     I feel like tomorrow's gonna be my
     <br/>
     last game. I want to stay up, make
     <br/>
     the time go slow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Why would it be your last game? You
     <br/>
     afraid of getting hurt?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No, that'd be a relief. Then, at
     <br/>
     least, I wouldn't be a failure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Joe, why are you thinking like this?
     <br/>
     Why would you be a failure? You're
     <br/>
     having a great year, you're a Heisman
     <br/>
     Trophy candidate, you got millions
     <br/>
     of dollars waiting for you in the
     <br/>
     pros.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (testy)
     <br/>
     How do you know what's waiting for
     <br/>
     me? You don't know me at all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (hurt)
     <br/>
     I don't know you? How can you say
     <br/>
     that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Because you wouldn't be here now if
     <br/>
     you did. You only know the guy that's
     <br/>
     supposed to make millions in the
     <br/>
     pros.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Is that what you think? That I'm
     <br/>
     with you for the money?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Why else?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Infuriated, she slaps him across the face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Fuck you, Joe.
     <br/>
     (starting to cry)
     <br/>
     I don't give a shit about your money.
     <br/>
     I don't even give a shit about
     <br/>
     football. And you know what? Maybe
     <br/>
     you're right, maybe I don't know
     <br/>
     you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN
     <br/>
     WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward
     <br/>
     the tracks as the train comes into view.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks,
     <br/>
     starts to worry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks
     <br/>
     facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the
     <br/>
     embankment toward him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you
     <br/>
     doing? No! No!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face
     <br/>
     down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties.
     <br/>
     Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the
     <br/>
     train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground,
     <br/>
     head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like
     <br/>
     a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his
     <br/>
     clothes flapping wildly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe
     <br/>
     lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes
     <br/>
     himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races
     <br/>
     toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade.
     <br/>
     She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps
     <br/>
     him over to the embankment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     God Joe, oh god, are you allright?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (drained)
     <br/>
     Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth.
     <br/>
     Guess you've really seen the dark
     <br/>
     side now, huh? You should've gotten
     <br/>
     out while you had the chance. Before
     <br/>
     it all goes to hell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I don't wanta get out, damnit. What's
     <br/>
     wrong Joe? Why would it all go to
     <br/>
     hell?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I'm a Kane, Camille. That's all it
     <br/>
     takes. We're cut out to be drunks
     <br/>
     and fuck-ups. We never live up to
     <br/>
     expectations. It's in our blood. My
     <br/>
     dad, brothers, uncles -- we all drink
     <br/>
     and sooner or later we all fuck up.
     <br/>
     My dad went the longest. Waited till
     <br/>
     he was playin' triple A ball, before
     <br/>
     he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel
     <br/>
     like I'm just waiting for my turn.
     <br/>
     The better I do, the closer it gets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You're not like them, you can beat
     <br/>
     all that. You can stop drinking, you
     <br/>
     can break the chain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     If I gave up that, I wouldn't be
     <br/>
     much of a football player. And if I
     <br/>
     wasn't a football player, what would
     <br/>
     I be?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The question hangs in the air.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You'de still be Joe. And I'd still
     <br/>
     love you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against
     <br/>
     each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Just don't say I never warned you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     STEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the
     <br/>
     jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is
     <br/>
     going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE
     <br/>
     4:29 to go and it's been a great
     <br/>
     one. Two undefeated teams goin' after
     <br/>
     each other. Michigan up by four, 24-
     <br/>
     20, but the lead has changed hands
     <br/>
     three times, and you get the feeling
     <br/>
     that whoever has the ball last is
     <br/>
     gonna win it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON FIELD
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells
     <br/>
     signals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Well, it was billed as a Heisman
     <br/>
     shootout, and it's been all of that.
     <br/>
     Both Waymen and Kane moving their
     <br/>
     teams up and down the field, having
     <br/>
     big days.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a
     <br/>
     receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle,
     <br/>
     15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety
     <br/>
     away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER
     <br/>
     SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line
     <br/>
     and out cold. The crowd goes wild.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Kane back to pass, can't find anybody,
     <br/>
     gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit
     <br/>
     at the goal-line... Touchdown E.S.U.!!
     <br/>
     Great run by Kane!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     He's still down. Looks like he's
     <br/>
     hurt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration
     <br/>
     around him begins to die down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON JOE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's
     <br/>
     shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY
     <br/>
     IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL
     <br/>
     a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins
     <br/>
     to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DOCTOR
     <br/>
     How many fingers am I holding up?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Four.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets
     <br/>
     under center, Alvin begins to yell at him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Hey, powderpuff. You're the white
     <br/>
     boy that ratted my brother out. Sent
     <br/>
     him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off
     <br/>
     with the fuckin' money. Left the
     <br/>
     blood to do the time, huh?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Waymen begins to call signals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Yeh, you're the little bastard.
     <br/>
     Account of you, my bros' datin' his
     <br/>
     cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff?
     <br/>
     Gonna make you pay. You gonna be my
     <br/>
     cellmate now. You gonna have 250
     <br/>
     lbs. of pissed-off nigger up your
     <br/>
     ass.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking
     <br/>
     for the run on third and short.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback,
     <br/>
     hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline,
     <br/>
     Coach Winters yells, "Pass! Pass!"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and
     <br/>
     takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball,
     <br/>
     Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the
     <br/>
     blitz, Waymen is goin for it all!
     <br/>
     Hit as he throws.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral.
     <br/>
     The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is
     <br/>
     a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the
     <br/>
     Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Hunt has got a step. He's got it!
     <br/>
     Touchdown!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters slams his headphones to the ground.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SCHEMBECKLER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Great clutch throw under pressure.
     <br/>
     Can't do it much better than that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON JOE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes
     <br/>
     him track his finger, etc.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DOCTOR
     <br/>
     You're vision's back to normal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You think you can go?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh, I'm fine. Just a little headache.
     <br/>
     (getting up, shouting
     <br/>
     to his teamates)
     <br/>
     O.K. Offense, let's get it back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Damn tough to scare that little white
     <br/>
     boy. Either his momma dropped him on
     <br/>
     his head, or the motherfucker is
     <br/>
     deaf.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters goes to Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Jefferson, in for Griffen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Griffen slams his helmet to the ground.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the
     <br/>
     line.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go,
     <br/>
     Kane brings 'em to the line of
     <br/>
     scrimmage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares
     <br/>
     out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes
     <br/>
     off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally
     <br/>
     runs out of bounds at the twenty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Great run by Jefferson, the highly-
     <br/>
     touted Freshman, the longest of the
     <br/>
     day for the Wolves. And this one is
     <br/>
     turning out to be everything we
     <br/>
     thought it would be.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON DARNELL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the
     <br/>
     center.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     O.K., time to put the women and
     <br/>
     children to bed, and go looking for
     <br/>
     dinner.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the
     <br/>
     Wild.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense,
     <br/>
     bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped.
     <br/>
     Action goes to SLOW MOTION.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback
     <br/>
     comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but
     <br/>
     knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the
     <br/>
     ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it,
     <br/>
     but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front
     <br/>
     and intercepts it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Kane looking for Jefferson. It's...
     <br/>
     Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman!
     <br/>
     And that should do it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback
     <br/>
     does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like
     <br/>
     he's been punched.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go
     <br/>
     to:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium
     <br/>
     behind him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE
     <br/>
     Well, it was everything we expected
     <br/>
     it to be. Fine performances on both
     <br/>
     sides of the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Players undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ZABRISKIE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     The edge in the much ballyhooed battle
     <br/>
     of the quarterbacks would probably
     <br/>
     have to go to Michigan's Tim Waymen
     <br/>
     who threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran
     <br/>
     for another. Joe Kane accounted for
     <br/>
     three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had
     <br/>
     that crucial interception in the
     <br/>
     waning moments. And that proved to
     <br/>
     be the difference.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters
     <br/>
     enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead
     <br/>
     against the wall, the water coursing over him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. TUNNEL BENEATH STADIUM - LATE AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and
     <br/>
     dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking
     <br/>
     to Coach Humes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Hey, Autumn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Hi, Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Is this your dad?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Yes...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     How do you do, Mr. Haley. I'm Darnell
     <br/>
     Jefferson.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Jefferson? Nice run you made on that
     <br/>
     screen pass. Another block and you
     <br/>
     might have scored.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Thank you. We'll get 'em next year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     How do you and Autumn know each other?
     <br/>
     You a friend of Ray's?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn
     <br/>
     has never told her dad about him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (filling the void)
     <br/>
     Ah, I tutor him...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Oh really? In what?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell would like to crawl under a rock.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Math and English.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Ah.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice.
     <br/>
     He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is
     <br/>
     not lost on Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Well, stay on top of that, Darnell.
     <br/>
     I'd have been in real trouble if I
     <br/>
     hadn't gotten my degree. I played
     <br/>
     ball once. Hurt my knee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Yeh, I know...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     I used to put a copy of my report
     <br/>
     card inside the webbing of my helmet
     <br/>
     to remind me that college was more
     <br/>
     important than football.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (forcing enthusiasm)
     <br/>
     Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin'.
     <br/>
     Nice to meet you Mr. Haley.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Nice to meet you, Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     See you around, Autumn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Autumn can respond, Ray Griffen approaches from the
     <br/>
     other direction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Hey, Ray. You still havin' dinner
     <br/>
     with us tonight?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he
     <br/>
     walks away. Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front
     <br/>
     of her father.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The post-game party. Not as raucous as after the opening
     <br/>
     game victory. A few players are dancing, but most are sitting,
     <br/>
     drinking, commiserating.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD LITE
     <br/>
     (to Alvin)
     <br/>
     Anybody seen Joe?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Not yet. Probably out with Camille.
     <br/>
     Haven't seen Darnell either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named LESLIE.
     <br/>
     They're kissing softly, light necking. Lattimer starts to
     <br/>
     unbutton her blouse. She begins to demur.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LESLIE
     <br/>
     I think we better get back downstairs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     No, Leslie, we're just getting to
     <br/>
     know each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LESLIE
     <br/>
     (starting to get up)
     <br/>
     No, I think...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed.
     <br/>
     She's starting to get a little scared.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     C'mon Leslie, you didn't come up
     <br/>
     here to stop now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for
     <br/>
     the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs
     <br/>
     her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     What were you doin'? Leadin' me on?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle.
     <br/>
     He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked,
     <br/>
     she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her
     <br/>
     around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her
     <br/>
     some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when
     <br/>
     suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN and Bud Lite and Alvin race
     <br/>
     in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (throwing Leslie on
     <br/>
     the bed again)
     <br/>
     Get outa here!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down,
     <br/>
     but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. Two
     <br/>
     other players charge in and finally all four are able to
     <br/>
     shackle Lattimer. He continues to struggle a bit, then gives
     <br/>
     up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     This is it, man. No more 'roids.
     <br/>
     This shit has gotta stop.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer breaks down and cries.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola.
     <br/>
     He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of
     <br/>
     himself. He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket.
     <br/>
     The phone rings. He looks at it a beat, then walks out of
     <br/>
     the room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe. She
     <br/>
     listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WINTERS HIGH-TECH VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending
     <br/>
     interception over and over. The phone rings.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Hello, yeh... What?!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WINTERS ATHLETIC OFFICE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on

     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     It looks like this will blow over.
     <br/>
     The girl's father is a big booster,
     <br/>
     contributed a lotta money. So he
     <br/>
     said they won't go to the press.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     He said that? The father?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Yeh, he's not exactly happy about
     <br/>
     all this, but he doesn't wanta hurt
     <br/>
     the program.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     We're still gonna have to suspend

     Lattimer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HUMES
     <br/>
     What for? There aren't any charges.
     <br/>
     Nobody outside the program knows
     <br/>
     about this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     He's outa control, Lyle. We can't
     <br/>
     ignore this anymore. I don't know
     <br/>
     what pisses me off more -- that he's
     <br/>
     juicin' or that he's doin' such a
     <br/>
     shitty job of hidin' it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HUMES
     <br/>
     He's never tested positive. If we
     <br/>
     suspend him without proof, he could
     <br/>
     sue us for jeopardizing his draft
     <br/>
     status, his pro career.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Yeh, but we can't sit and wait till
     <br/>
     he kills somebody. I hate to lose
     <br/>
     him as much as you do, but we gotta
     <br/>
     clean him up before he does somethin'
     <br/>
     that lands the whole program on
     <br/>
     probation. Plus, we have to take
     <br/>
     some action or the girl's dad is
     <br/>
     gonna start havin' second thoughts.
     <br/>
     I don't care how many checks he's
     <br/>
     written.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     So what do we do?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     All eyes go to Winters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Bring him down here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTERS LOCKER ROOM OFFICE - 20 MINUTES LATER
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Close on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Three games? Why so many?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You oughta be grateful I didn't
     <br/>
     suspend you for the whole year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer nods, he knows it's true.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     What are you gonna give as the reason?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     We'll say you've got a hamstring
     <br/>
     pull.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (relieved)
     <br/>
     Thank you, Coach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't thank me. During those three
     <br/>
     weeks, you better kick the roids,
     <br/>
     cause when you come back I'm gonna
     <br/>
     personally test you before every
     <br/>
     game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I'm
     <br/>
     gonna watch the piss go into the
     <br/>
     bottle. You got that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (barely audible, shamed)
     <br/>
     Yes, sir.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Start practicing your limp.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back,
     <br/>
     with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are
     <br/>
     down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of
     <br/>
     TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Coupla real college heroes, huh?
     <br/>
     Tearin' up the town.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     First time I ever lost a girl and a
     <br/>
     game on the same day. Guess I never
     <br/>
     really had the girl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving
     <br/>
     him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not
     <br/>
     really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     You know that guy?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DEBBI
     <br/>
     Not really...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     Then why you smilin' at him?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DEBBI
     <br/>
     I don't know... he looks like that
     <br/>
     E.S.U. quarterback guy. Joe, what's
     <br/>
     his name?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     So what? So you go and smile at him?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to
     <br/>
     Joe's table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     You been lookin' at my girlfriend?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (a little drunk himself)
     <br/>
     I don't know. Which one is she?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime
     <br/>
     quarterback. The one who choked his
     <br/>
     ass off today. You got nothin' better
     <br/>
     to do then look at my girlfriend?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe says nothing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     Hey, Heisman, I'm talkin' to you.
     <br/>
     You too good to talk to me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I'm not even interested in talkin'
     <br/>
     to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BOYFRIEND
     <br/>
     You think you're a bad ass? You think
     <br/>
     my girl's hot for you? Take your
     <br/>
     pads off, you're just another pussy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him
     <br/>
     away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone
     <br/>
     as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the
     <br/>
     boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the
     <br/>
     floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in
     <br/>
     his shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (grabbing him)
     <br/>
     C'mon we gotta get outa here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line
     <br/>
     on the curves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe's driving, Darnell's holding on. Suddenly we hear SIRENS.
     <br/>
     Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Oh shit...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters is asleep. The phone rings. He picks it up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What is it now?... Oh Jesus...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTERS' STADIUM OFFICE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits across the desk from Winters, just the two of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     The guy went for me first. What was
     <br/>
     I supposed to do?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Doesn't make any difference. It made
     <br/>
     the papers, all the wire services.
     <br/>
     The guy had to go to the hospital.
     <br/>
     Worst of all they got you on drunk
     <br/>
     driving. You had a blood alcohol
     <br/>
     level .50 above the legal limit. We
     <br/>
     can't smooth that over, Joe. It'd
     <br/>
     look like we were sprayin' Pledge on
     <br/>
     bird shit. We had to agree to send
     <br/>
     you to Rehab.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Rehab? I'll be a god-damn joke. You
     <br/>
     can't do this to me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     It was the only way we could get
     <br/>
     them to drop the assault and D.W.I.
     <br/>
     You go to trial on those, we lose
     <br/>
     you for a year, and risk NCAA
     <br/>
     investigation. C'mon, lotsa athletes
     <br/>
     have been through Rehab.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Not in the middle of the season. Not
     <br/>
     in the middle of a Heisman campaign.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You'll only miss four games. You'll
     <br/>
     be back in time for the last one,
     <br/>
     Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get
     <br/>
     there. Plus, you've still got your
     <br/>
     senior year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh, but what will I come back as?
     <br/>
     What kinda player?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't worry, you'll still be the
     <br/>
     Man. You'll still be the leader of
     <br/>
     this team.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up
     <br/>
     to leave.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I'm sorry, Coach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     These things happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe walks on out, Winters watches him go, then slams the
     <br/>
     desk in anger. Drained, he sinks back in his chair.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Fuckin' kids.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell's walking across campus toward class. Autumn sees
     <br/>
     him, calls out to him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Darnell, wait. C'mon Darnell, I wanta
     <br/>
     talk to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell doesn't slow up. Autumn has to run to catch up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Where you been, I been callin' you?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Been busy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Darnell, I'm sorry about Saturday.
     <br/>
     It was an awkward situation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     It wasn't awkward. It was educational.
     <br/>
     I realized how you see me. I'm good
     <br/>
     enough to tutor, to go places with,
     <br/>
     but not to tell your father about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     That's not it. It's just that my
     <br/>
     father expects me to be with somebody
     <br/>
     like Ray. He wouldn't understand us.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     (stopping)
     <br/>
     Why not?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I don't know... he likes Ray cause...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     He's a good student, he acts right...
     <br/>
     he doesn't need football. He's class
     <br/>
     and I'm not, right?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I didn't say that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You don't have to, Autumn. I'm
     <br/>
     everything your dad used to be and
     <br/>
     don't want you fallin' back into.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Darnell...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You were right before, Autumn. I
     <br/>
     should have another tutor. Thanks
     <br/>
     for everything you did for me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell walks away. Autumn can only watch him go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe finishes packing his bags. He sees a picture of Camille
     <br/>
     on the dresser. Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in
     <br/>
     the trash. He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the
     <br/>
     shower, pulls out a match and lights it. He watches it catch
     <br/>
     fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We
     <br/>
     hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. REHAB CENTER - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is shown into his room. Bare. One cot. One dresser. He
     <br/>
     drops his bag, sags onto the bed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Four fuckin' weeks?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A tired and depressed group of E.S.U. football players undress
     <br/>
     after practice. Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer
     <br/>
     standing in street clothes. Bud softly sings "Don't Cry For
     <br/>
     Me Argentina."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Shit, the defense is gonna have to
     <br/>
     pitch shutouts now...
     <br/>
     (to Lattimer)
     <br/>
     and you're gone for 3. What the hell
     <br/>
     did you take that shit for?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Nobody seemed to mind when I was
     <br/>
     knockin' people's dicks in the dirt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     I bust chops too. I don't have to
     <br/>
     get all fucked up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     Not everybody has the ability you
     <br/>
     do, Alvin. You do what you have to
     <br/>
     do to play.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Well, you're not playin' much now
     <br/>
     are you? Shit, whole fuckin' season
     <br/>
     down the drain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after
     <br/>
     practice. The stadium is deserted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     I been talkin' to Chancellor Wilson...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What's he wanta do now, cut practice
     <br/>
     down to once a week?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     No, he's happy with the way the
     <br/>
     season's gone so far. The Alumni
     <br/>
     have pretty much stayed off his back,
     <br/>
     but with Joe out now, it could all
     <br/>
     be up for grabs again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     He thinks he's gonna have trouble
     <br/>
     marchin' the ball down the old fund-
     <br/>
     raisin' board, huh?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     The facts are, all we have left are
     <br/>
     freshman quarterbacks, and nothin' I
     <br/>
     saw at practice today, convinced me
     <br/>
     that any of them are ready to step
     <br/>
     in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What are you sayin?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     We gotta get Bobby Collins back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Wilson say that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     He didn't have to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All-
     <br/>
     Star either.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     Yeh, but he's good enough to get us
     <br/>
     a split of the next four games.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Look, just because you're Wilson's
     <br/>
     boy all of a sudden, doesn't mean
     <br/>
     I'm gonna let him make me look like
     <br/>
     a fuckin' whore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     Don't give me that high and mighty
     <br/>
     shit. There's a lotta people on the
     <br/>
     bubble here. Four straight loses and
     <br/>
     we're out of bowl contention. How's
     <br/>
     that gonna make you look? If you're
     <br/>
     too stupid to consider your own
     <br/>
     situation, then maybe you oughta
     <br/>
     think about your assistant coaches.
     <br/>
     They've got families to feed too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Howard walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the
     <br/>
     middle of the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. BOARD OF REGENTS HEARING ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of
     <br/>
     a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the
     <br/>
     other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President
     <br/>
     of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor,
     <br/>
     ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER,
     <br/>
     and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FOWLER
     <br/>
     Therefore, I respectfully submit
     <br/>
     that Bobby Collins should not be
     <br/>
     given special treatment just because
     <br/>
     he's a football player. Would a
     <br/>
     regular student get a reinstatement
     <br/>
     hearing if they'de been caught
     <br/>
     cheating? Nobody's talking about
     <br/>
     letting the girl who took the test
     <br/>
     back in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters could kill this kid.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     I think it's also instructive to
     <br/>
     look at some of the courses this
     <br/>
     young man has taken. Beginning Golf,
     <br/>
     Voice and Speech Improvement...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SHANE
     <br/>
     I'd like to point out that Mr. Collins
     <br/>
     was still on schedule to get his
     <br/>
     degree.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     (pointing to Collin's
     <br/>
     transcript)
     <br/>
     In what, Swimming Pool Management?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHAIRMAN
     <br/>
     Would you like to respond, Coach
     <br/>
     Winters?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the
     <br/>
     odious nature of what he has to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I don't know much about all this
     <br/>
     other stuff, but I do know the
     <br/>
     punishment should fit the crime.
     <br/>
     Cheating's bad, but I don't think it
     <br/>
     deserves a life sentence. Here's one
     <br/>
     of those athletes who takes college
     <br/>
     level courses, who wants to graduate.
     <br/>
     I think Bobby Collins made a big
     <br/>
     mistake, but he's already been
     <br/>
     suspended for several weeks. He's
     <br/>
     served his time. I think he deserves
     <br/>
     a second chance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second
     <br/>
     chance and since he's had 5
     <br/>
     incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still
     <br/>
     reads at a fourth grade level. You're
     <br/>
     using his body to make money for the
     <br/>
     Athletic Department -- you, yourself,
     <br/>
     are making three times what the
     <br/>
     Chancellor is -- but obviously no
     <br/>
     one is making an effort to see that
     <br/>
     this kid gets an education.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     He's helpin' to pay for your physics
     <br/>
     lab too. If you're willin' to go
     <br/>
     without a new office, maybe I could
     <br/>
     hold him out a few games. Save his
     <br/>
     body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHAIRMAN
     <br/>
     Gentlemen...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     SHANE
     <br/>
     Alvin was way behind in school when
     <br/>
     he got here. You can't make up for,
     <br/>
     in four years, what it took 18 to
     <br/>
     create.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     Then he should never have been
     <br/>
     admitted in the first place. It's
     <br/>
     not fair to other students who worked
     <br/>
     hard to get here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     Is it fair to exclude kids who come
     <br/>
     from inferior schools? You hold
     <br/>
     everybody to the same standards,
     <br/>
     you're discriminating against the
     <br/>
     poor kids.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Most of my players are farm boys,
     <br/>
     inner-city kids. Football is their
     <br/>
     deliverance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     Deliverance from what? A valid
     <br/>
     education?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin
     <br/>
     out, you take away their futures. In
     <br/>
     Alvin's case you probably cost him a
     <br/>
     couple million dollars in the pros.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     But this is not a football vocational
     <br/>
     school. It's an Institute of Higher
     <br/>
     Learning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000
     <br/>
     people showed up to watch a kid do a
     <br/>
     chemistry experiment?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHAIRMAN
     <br/>
     Gentlemen, please, let's get back to
     <br/>
     the business at hand, Bobby Collins.
     <br/>
     As you know, I played football here.
     <br/>
     And I remember how hard it was to
     <br/>
     practice and then study when you're
     <br/>
     dead tired. So I have some sympathy
     <br/>
     for this young man. But I never
     <br/>
     cheated, so the real question is his
     <br/>
     character. Since you know him better
     <br/>
     than anyone else in this room; and
     <br/>
     having talked to him and observed
     <br/>
     him over the last several weeks, do
     <br/>
     you feel he's learned his lesson? In
     <br/>
     other words, can you vouch for his
     <br/>
     character?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (it's killing him)
     <br/>
     Yes, sir, I can.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby Collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Learnihan and Winters come down the steps, their faces set.
     <br/>
     As they split off:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LEARNIHAN
     <br/>
     Another case like this, I'll take it
     <br/>
     all the way up to the Governor.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't mess with me, Learnihan. I'll
     <br/>
     have you teachin' Study Hall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby Collins walks in prior to practice. His teammates gather
     <br/>
     round, slap him on the back, high five etc. Winters watches
     <br/>
     from his office, disgusted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his
     <br/>
     upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though,
     <br/>
     his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him. Suddenly,
     <br/>
     he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces.
     <br/>
     His hand bleeds. He doesn't care. He just sits there and
     <br/>
     seethes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille's on the phone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer.
     <br/>
     I'd like to speak to Joe Kane.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket. A NURSE
     <br/>
     knocks on his door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NURSE
     <br/>
     You've got a phone call. A Camille
     <br/>
     Schaeffer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe says nothing, not wanting to deal with this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NURSE
     <br/>
     She says she's your girlfriend
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I don't want to talk to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NURSE
     <br/>
     You sure?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The nurse leaves. Joe gets up, goes to the wall, and starts
     <br/>
     pounding it with his right hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     NURSE (V.O.)
     <br/>
     I'm sorry, he doesn't wish to speak
     <br/>
     to you right now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Crushed and angry, Camille hangs up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ATHLETIC DORM HALL - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud Lite is watching television. Louanne enters on her way
     <br/>
     to Bobby Collins' room, carrying an armload of neatly-pressed
     <br/>
     laundry. But Lite gets up to bar her way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Hey, Louanne, how ya' doin?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C.,
     <br/>
     hopin' to get back in here next year.
     <br/>
     Just came by to give Bobby some
     <br/>
     laundry I did for him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     You two seein' each other again?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Yeh, he was even talking about us
     <br/>
     gettin' a place off campus together,
     <br/>
     until he got reinstated. I don't
     <br/>
     know how I woulda told my dad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud just nods blankly. Louanne starts to head for Bobby's
     <br/>
     room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     Ah, Louanne...
     <br/>
     (pained to say it)
     <br/>
     I wouldn't go in there right now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Why not?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud doesn't have the heart to tell her. She finally realizes
     <br/>
     Bobby's with another girl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Ah. Guess I'm pretty stupid when it
     <br/>
     comes to men. I never learn, do I?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BUD
     <br/>
     I think maybe men are just stupid
     <br/>
     when it comes to you. If you ever
     <br/>
     feel like, ya know, just talkin'
     <br/>
     sometime, gettin' a beer -- let me
     <br/>
     know. My schedule's pretty open.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     Thanks, Bud
     <br/>
     (handing him the
     <br/>
     clothes)
     <br/>
     Give him these, will ya?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud nods. Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the
     <br/>
     hall with as much dignity as she can muster.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe
     <br/>
     huddled on his bed. Shivering.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Get up. I wanta talk to you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't sit up. Stand up. If you can.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters
     <br/>
     reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides
     <br/>
     his right hand behind his body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     What's the matter, Joe? You won't
     <br/>
     shake hands with me.
     <br/>
     (Joe is silent)
     <br/>
     You don't want me to see your hand,
     <br/>
     do you?
     <br/>
     (more silence)
     <br/>
     So I guess what I heard was true,
     <br/>
     huh? You been poundin' the walls
     <br/>
     with your passin' hand, right?
     <br/>
     (silence)
     <br/>
     I tell you what, Joe, you want to
     <br/>
     hit somethin', hit me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe doesn't move.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I said hit me. I'm the one who put
     <br/>
     you in here. Don't hit the damn wall.
     <br/>
     It ain't the wall's fault. Hit me!
     <br/>
     Go on, hit me right now!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Who else you wanta hit, huh? you're
     <br/>
     daddy maybe? Cause he's a no-show
     <br/>
     prick? Well, I'm a daddy, too, and
     <br/>
     not a very good one at that. So just
     <br/>
     hit me instead! I'll take your daddy's
     <br/>
     beatin' for him. Go on, you want to.
     <br/>
     Hit me, damnit!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe shakes his head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (pushes Joe in the
     <br/>
     chest)
     <br/>
     Hit me! I'm not gonna leave you alone
     <br/>
     until you hit me.
     <br/>
     (shakes Joe by
     <br/>
     shoulders)
     <br/>
     The guys'll thank you. They've always
     <br/>
     wanted to do it. So do it now, damnit!
     <br/>
     Do it!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sinks to his knees. Winters stares down at him, then
     <br/>
     kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     O.K., Joe, it's o.k. I guess I need
     <br/>
     it more than you do.
     <br/>
     (pause)
     <br/>
     You gotta quit beatin' up on yourself.
     <br/>
     Let me see that hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe reveals his hand. It's barked and cut, but not badly
     <br/>
     swollen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     It's o.k.
     <br/>
     (playfully)
     <br/>
     You can still throw with it, you
     <br/>
     fuckin' mook.
     <br/>
     (pause)
     <br/>
     Look, the nurses say this is the
     <br/>
     toughest time for you right now. I
     <br/>
     thought I'd stick around a little,
     <br/>
     case you wanta play some cards, pick
     <br/>
     a fight with the wall again,
     <br/>
     whatever...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     You don't have to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Yes I do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia. He
     <br/>
     carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into
     <br/>
     his toilet. Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble
     <br/>
     into the water. He flushes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DISSOLVE TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sun shines through the window. Joe wakes up, raises up,
     <br/>
     looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair. Winters
     <br/>
     rouses. Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright. Winters
     <br/>
     gives him a nod of approval.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC UP. BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     detailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON FIELD
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game. The
     <br/>
     scoreboard reads E.S.U. 14 Boston College 10.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. STUDY HALL
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Darnell in study hall, with his new tutor concentrating
     <br/>
     on her explanation, applying himself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON SIDELINE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3) Steve Lattimer, in street clothes, paces the sidelines,
     <br/>
     jumping up and down in frustration, his hamstring bandaged
     <br/>
     to sell the injury ruse. He catches himself, gets back on
     <br/>
     his crutches. A newspaper fades up through the shot. It reads
     <br/>
     "Wolves Offense Fires Blanks in 13-0 Loss to Texas."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAFE - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     4) Darnell sits in a cafe, drinking coffee and studying. Ray
     <br/>
     comes in, his arm around a co-ed, MONICA. They buy a pastry
     <br/>
     and leave, not having seen Darnell. Darnell ponders this a
     <br/>
     second, goes back to studying.
     <br/>

     INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     5) A group of patients is gathered around a T.V. set in the
     <br/>
     Rehab Center, watching a pre-game show. One goes to Joe's
     <br/>
     room, where Joe's lying on his cot.

     Hey, Joe, don't you wanta watch the
     <br/>
     game? It's on cable.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No thanks.

     <br/>
     Joe leans back, staring at the ceiling.

     6) Sportscaster DALLAS PERRY is holding forth on the local
     <br/>
     evening news.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     PERRY
     <br/>
     E.S.U. on the strength of a 62 yard
     <br/>
     touchdown run by freshman Darnell
     <br/>
     Jefferson, squeaked by the North
     <br/>
     Carolina Tarheels today, 14 to 13,
     <br/>
     keeping their bowl hopes alive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. CAMPUS NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     7) Darnell, with his books, on the way to the library, passes
     <br/>
     the frat house where the victory party is in progress. He
     <br/>
     sees Ray and Autumn walking together. Autumn sees him, her
     <br/>
     face lights up. He gives her a slight smile, keeps walking.
     <br/>
     She watches him with a certain longing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LIBRARY - LATE NIGHT
     <br/>

     8) Darnell, alone in the library, late at night, studying.

     INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     9) Lattimer, carrying his gear bag, walks into the locker
     <br/>
     room. His teammates come over to shake his hand, slap him on
     <br/>
     the back, welcome him back to the team.

     INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits on his bed listening to the E.S.U. broadcast.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     E.S.U. hoping to get past a tough
     <br/>
     Iowa Hawkeyes team in their last
     <br/>
     game before the return of star
     <br/>
     quarterback, Joe Kane.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The E.S.U. defense is on the field. Alvin moves up opposite
     <br/>
     the OFFENSIVE GUARD.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     I know you, motherfucker. You're the
     <br/>
     prick who got my little sister
     <br/>
     pregnant. We ain't seen you around
     <br/>
     lately. Where you been, huh? Answer
     <br/>
     me, motherfucker, or I'm gonna peel
     <br/>
     your cap.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ball is hiked. Iowa runs a sweep left. Lattimer tries to
     <br/>
     get outside to contain, but is blocked by the fullback, who
     <br/>
     goes low and cuts his legs out from under him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Shit, Lattimer...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the
     <br/>
     corner, then suddenly cuts back. Alvin has overrun the play
     <br/>
     slightly. We go to SLOW MOTION as he turns and is hit with a
     <br/>
     wicked CRACK-BACK BLOCK by the guard he taunted. Alvin's leg
     <br/>
     flexes at a horrifying angle. We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and
     <br/>
     tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain,
     <br/>
     grabbing his left leg.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Oh, no...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The doctor and trainers sprint out to the field.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We move in on Joe's face, as Harvey is heard on the radio in
     <br/>
     the b.g.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Oh, boy, this does not look good,
     <br/>
     Harmon. They're bringing the
     <br/>
     stretchers out...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe's eyes close. He knows what this means.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE FIELD - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin is being strapped on the stretcher.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     (wailing in pain)
     <br/>
     Oh, shit, oh shit, I'll kill that
     <br/>
     motherfucker. I'll... Oh shit...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     An ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium. We
     <br/>
     hear CHEERING inside, the SIREN outside.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving
     <br/>
     for the winning touchdown. Fourth
     <br/>
     and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying
     <br/>
     to hold on without their star middle
     <br/>
     linebacker, Alvin Mack.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. THE FIELD AGAIN - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up
     <br/>
     his remaining strength.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one
     <br/>
     block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in
     <br/>
     a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving,
     <br/>
     twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was
     <br/>
     on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line.
     <br/>
     Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits
     <br/>
     where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.
     <br/>

     REPORTER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Coach, you've lost two of your last
     <br/>
     four.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. INTERVIEW ROOM UNDER STADIUM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters faces the press.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REPORTER
     <br/>
     Why do your teams seem to nose dive
     <br/>
     at the end of the last couple seasons?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COACH WINTERS
     <br/>
     This was a tough loss, but this ain't
     <br/>
     any nose dive. We've had some key
     <br/>
     players out, but if we win next week,
     <br/>
     we'll still win the conference and
     <br/>
     go to a major bowl on New Year's
     <br/>
     Day. I mean, I know you guys can't
     <br/>
     write, but I thought you could at
     <br/>
     least count.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. He's
     <br/>
     still a little groggy from anesthetic. Coach Winters stands
     <br/>
     beside him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You look good, Alvin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Yeh, I feel o.k.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Any of the guys been down yet?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     They called.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Hell, you know how football players
     <br/>
     are about hospitals and injuries.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     Yeh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Several beats of silence. Then:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     I'm never gonna play again, am I?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Doctors aren't always right, Alvin...
     <br/>
     but I just want you to know... you're
     <br/>
     the best defensive football player I
     <br/>
     ever coached.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin nods. Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head,
     <br/>
     gives him a smile, walks out. Tears brim in Winters eyes as
     <br/>
     he leaves. Alvin's head goes back against the pillow. Tears
     <br/>
     aren't brimming here. They're rolling down his cheeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC BEGINS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. REHAB CENTER - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe walks out with his suitcase. Coach Winters waits for
     <br/>
     him. Shakes his hand. They get in the car.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Congratulations. I'm proud of you,
     <br/>
     Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CAR - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I know you had a difficult time.
     <br/>
     Michigan is easy, right? Bourbon is
     <br/>
     tough.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Scotch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They share a laugh. Winters pulls out two sets of round trip
     <br/>
     airline tickets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I got somethin' for ya. Coupla round
     <br/>
     trip tickets. Go see your dad. Get
     <br/>
     it cleaned up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe takes the tickets, just looks at him.
     <br/>

     INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (on the phone)
     <br/>
     I'm gonna have to take a test with
     <br/>
     the coach right there. You sure you
     <br/>
     got somethin' better than blockers?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DEALER (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Much better. This guy is foolproof.
     <br/>
     See ya Saturday.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a
     <br/>
     second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an
     <br/>
     inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a
     <br/>
     beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously,
     <br/>
     biceps bulging.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC ENDS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The coach is facing Ray and Darnell across his desk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     I wanta do something different for
     <br/>
     this game. Try to maximize our speed,
     <br/>
     but keep you both in the lineup at
     <br/>
     the same time. Ray, I'm moving you
     <br/>
     to fullback. Darnell, you're startin'
     <br/>
     at tail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray is stunned, Darnell elated, but neither says a word.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Ray, you'll be carrying the ball
     <br/>
     less and blocking more, but they'll
     <br/>
     still have to respect your running
     <br/>
     and pass-catching ability. Not
     <br/>
     everybody can make a transition like
     <br/>
     this. You think you can handle it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     (tight lipped)
     <br/>
     Yes, sir.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Good. We can't afford any hang dogs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. TENNIS COURTS - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille comes off the court, after tennis practice. She's
     <br/>
     surprised to find Joe waiting for her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Hello, Camille.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     (cool)
     <br/>
     Hello, Joe. You allright now?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh... yeh, I think so.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Good, I'm happy for you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She starts to walk away, heading for the bike racks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Camille, hold on, O.K.? I'm sorry
     <br/>
     that I didn't want... that I couldn't
     <br/>
     see you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     You couldn't even talk to me. What
     <br/>
     happened to "there's somethin' goin'
     <br/>
     on between you and me"?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille gets on her bike...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     C'mon, Camille, I was embarrassed. I
     <br/>
     couldn't...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     and pedals off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (shouting after her)
     <br/>
     I couldn't understand why anybody
     <br/>
     would wanta talk to me. Camille!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She just keeps on going.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL TOWN - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of
     <br/>
     Joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund
     <br/>
     steel works filling the sky in the background. The bus stops
     <br/>
     at a corner. Joe steps off. No bag. He's not planning on
     <br/>
     staying long.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe goes to the front door. Knocks, gets no answer, pushes
     <br/>
     the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to
     <br/>
     the back porch. Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a
     <br/>
     cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's DAD. He's got a
     <br/>
     couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he
     <br/>
     has the look of one.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     How ya doin', Dad?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DAD
     <br/>
     (surprised to see him)
     <br/>
     Joe! What's this? They throw you
     <br/>
     out?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     No.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     I heard about your little set-to.
     <br/>
     They had it on the news here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Yeh, they sent me to rehab.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     We know what that's worth. Your
     <br/>
     brother's been through it three times.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe nods sadly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     So what are you doin' here?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I've been thinking about some things,
     <br/>
     Dad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     That's what that damn rehab'll do.
     <br/>
     Make you think about a lotta things
     <br/>
     you can't do nothing' about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I kinda been wonderin' why you never
     <br/>
     came to any of my games. All those
     <br/>
     years.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     Oh, I don't know. I guess I didn't
     <br/>
     wanta make you nervous. You mighta
     <br/>
     tried too hard and screwed up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Or I mighta done real well. Which
     <br/>
     woulda been harder on you, Dad?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     (sensing the anger)
     <br/>
     What do you mean?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe
     <br/>
     it wasn't written someplace that we
     <br/>
     all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe
     <br/>
     you coulda done somethin' more, if
     <br/>
     you'de tried a little harder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     Or maybe I didn't wanta see you
     <br/>
     gettin' all excited, all pumped up
     <br/>
     with pride, when I knew one day it
     <br/>
     would all come crashin' down. Just
     <br/>
     like it did.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I think I spent the last couple years
     <br/>
     hopin' I'd die before that day. But
     <br/>
     you know what Dad? That day came and
     <br/>
     I'm still here. And I got one more
     <br/>
     game this year. I don't know how
     <br/>
     well I'll play or even how much, but
     <br/>
     I want you there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     How would you feel introducing your
     <br/>
     drunk dad to all your friends? You
     <br/>
     think about that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I could live with it, if you could.
     <br/>
     (handing him a ticket)
     <br/>
     Here's a ticket. Section 2, Row 6.
     <br/>
     Fifty yard line. If you don't come,
     <br/>
     I'll never ask you again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE'S DAD
     <br/>
     O.K., Joey. And good luck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They give each other a short, quick hug. Nothing sentimental.
     <br/>
     Joe walks back through the house. His dad stares out at the
     <br/>
     yard.
     <br/>

     INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables. He
     <br/>
     hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another
     <br/>
     person. He looks up to see Autumn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Hey, Autumn. How's Ray?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Don't know. Haven't seen him since
     <br/>
     the night I saw you. He'd been goin'
     <br/>
     out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Monica Lambert.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     You knew? Why didn't you tell me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Didn't wanta win you over that way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Silence. Darnell looks back at his books.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     I just wondered how your studying
     <br/>
     was comin'. You ready for tomorrow?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     The test? I hope so. I been workin'
     <br/>
     pretty hard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Good...
     <br/>
     (sitting down)
     <br/>
     I talked to my dad last night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Oh, yeah? How's he doin?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Fine. We talked about you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     What did you say?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     (eyes brimming)
     <br/>
     I told him I'd gone out with you...
     <br/>
     I told him I wished I could still go
     <br/>
     bowling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet. He hugs her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC BEGINS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is bent over his test booklet. He writes furiously,
     <br/>
     stops to think, starts writing again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball
     <br/>
     flutters badly, falling short.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     He's rusty. I doubt if we can start
     <br/>
     him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (simmering)
     <br/>
     He's worse than that. He's outa shape.
     <br/>
     (blowing his whistle)
     <br/>
     All right, that's enough for today.
     <br/>
     Practice is cancelled. Everybody off
     <br/>
     the field, but Kane.
     <br/>
     (the players hesitate)
     <br/>
     C'mon what the hell are you standin'
     <br/>
     around lookin' at? Get outa here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file
     <br/>
     off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to
     <br/>
     Joe, who has no idea what this is about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Didn't do much while you were in
     <br/>
     there, did ya?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Well, we didn't exactly have a team...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You could've worked out on your own.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I had some other things to worry
     <br/>
     about...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Well, we're gonna make up for lost
     <br/>
     time. We'll start by hoppin' the
     <br/>
     steps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Hoppin' the steps?! What, you're
     <br/>
     gonna punish me now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't talk back to me, Joe. I'll
     <br/>
     kick your ass. I went easy on you,
     <br/>
     'cause you had to get through detox,
     <br/>
     but that's out to sea now. You let
     <br/>
     this team down; you let this program
     <br/>
     down. Start those steps. Right leg.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON JOE - STADIUM
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot, laboring as
     <br/>
     he passes Winters, halfway up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Now the left.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the
     <br/>
     steps, his quadriceps bursting with pain.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DISSOLVE TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE - LATER - STADIUM
     <br/>
     <br/>
     hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar
     <br/>
     of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, Winters watching from
     <br/>
     below.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DISSOLVE TO:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE - AT SUNSET - STADIUM
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bone weary now. Winters has him run 20 yards, get down and
     <br/>
     do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only
     <br/>
     do 4. Winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to
     <br/>
     run again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     70 guys. 70 guys who busted their
     <br/>
     butts all year. Because of you they
     <br/>
     might not win the conference. Because
     <br/>
     of you they might not go to a bowl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (barely able to stand)
     <br/>
     I didn't wanna leave... I just screwed
     <br/>
     up...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     You dogged on them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (stopping, exhausted)
     <br/>
     No, no I never dogged. I worked my
     <br/>
     ass off. I played hard...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (pushing him forward)
     <br/>
     Then you shoulda stayed in shape.
     <br/>
     Keep runnin', dammit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (wobbling, starting
     <br/>
     to break down)
     <br/>
     I always played hard. I gave my
     <br/>
     everything for you. When you came to
     <br/>
     the Center, I thought you were really
     <br/>
     worried about me. But you don't give
     <br/>
     a shit. We're all just a buncha sled
     <br/>
     dogs. If you had another guy who
     <br/>
     could throw, you'da left me in the
     <br/>
     fuckin' hospital.
     <br/>
     (falling to his knees,
     <br/>
     sobbing)
     <br/>
     The only thing that matters is the
     <br/>
     program, the god-damn program.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters pushes Joe down to do his pushups. Joe has to strain
     <br/>
     mightily to do two.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Nobody forced you to play football,
     <br/>
     Joe. Not me, not the program, nobody.
     <br/>
     But when you sign on, you commit
     <br/>
     yourself to pay the price, to do
     <br/>
     whatever it takes. Well, you haven't
     <br/>
     paid the price yet. You still owe
     <br/>
     this team. You owe this team big-
     <br/>
     time.
     <br/>
     (walking away)
     <br/>
     Get a shower.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as
     <br/>
     Winters continues to walk away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOW RENT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - MORNING
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer lies on a table, a CATHETER TUBE going into his
     <br/>
     side. A DOCTOR'S AIDE supervises. Lattimer's dealer is there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     What's this doin?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DEALER
     <br/>
     Takin' doped urine outa your bladder
     <br/>
     and puttin clean back in. Call it an
     <br/>
     oil change.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - BEFORE THE GAME
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters watches unknowingly as Lattimer pees the
     <br/>
     catheterized urine into a cup.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MUSIC ENDS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. LOCKER ROOM - JUST BEFORE THE GAME
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The team is gathered around. Conspicuous among them is
     <br/>
     Lattimer, who's painted his face like a skeleton. Coach
     <br/>
     Winters is whipping them up with a pre-game rant.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Gotta get it done today, boys. Gotta
     <br/>
     ring that bell. 60 minutes. 60 minutes
     <br/>
     of mean. No prisoners. No mercy.
     <br/>
     Nothin' but snot bubbles. Gotta ring
     <br/>
     that bell, gotta ring that
     <br/>
     Championship bell.

     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     (shouting)
     <br/>
     Ding Motherfucking Dong!!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pumped to the gills, the E.S.U. team explodes in yells and
     <br/>
     races out into the tunnel. The YELLING continues OVER and
     <br/>
     mixes with the CHEERING OF THE CROWD as:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Wolves movin' left to right on your
     <br/>
     radio dial. Looking to generate some
     <br/>
     offense. They've been up and down
     <br/>
     the last few weeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON BOBBY COLLINS in the huddle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     COLLINS
     <br/>
     28 Thunder right. On go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins
     <br/>
     calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass.
     <br/>
     Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass.
     <br/>
     Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the
     <br/>
     ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a
     <br/>
     good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is
     <br/>
     out ahead blocking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into
     <br/>
     the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins
     <br/>
     to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the
     <br/>
     linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his
     <br/>
     head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the
     <br/>
     football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets
     <br/>
     free safety comes up with it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     REGULAR SPEED
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back
     <br/>
     down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says
     <br/>
     nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ALVIN MACK'S SHACK - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin sits alone in the "living room", listening to the E.S.U.
     <br/>
     game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His
     <br/>
     mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     So the Wolves defense has held after
     <br/>
     the fumble, and the Yellow Jackets
     <br/>
     will opt for the field goal. Around
     <br/>
     a 34 yarder. Ball is down, it's away,
     <br/>
     it's long enough. And good! Georgia
     <br/>
     Tech jumps out on top 3-0.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from
     <br/>
     Alvin. There's none.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick
     <br/>
     sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets'
     <br/>
     CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down
     <br/>
     the sideline for a touchdown.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Collins back to pass, rushed, now
     <br/>
     fires out in the flat. It's picked
     <br/>
     off by Hill. Down the sideline. He's
     <br/>
     gonna go in untouched. Touchdown,
     <br/>
     Georgia Tech.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker
     <br/>
     room. Some swear, some bang their lockers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LATTIMER
     <br/>
     C'mon guys, we're only down ten.
     <br/>
     Let's get our fuckin' shit together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell marches over to Ray's locker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     You missed that block on purpose,
     <br/>
     didn't you, asshole.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     You're full of shit. You fumble, you
     <br/>
     try to blame me.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     It's Autumn isn't it? That's what
     <br/>
     this is all about.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     The hell with Autumn. You just can't
     <br/>
     take a hit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Infuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging.
     <br/>
     Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging,
     <br/>
     trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several
     <br/>
     players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges
     <br/>
     over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Don't tell me who started it. I don't
     <br/>
     care. All I care about is this
     <br/>
     football team. We win together. We
     <br/>
     lose together. So whatever your
     <br/>
     problem is, get over it. I don't
     <br/>
     want any more of this shit.
     <br/>
     Understand?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL AND RAY
     <br/>
     Yes, sir.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     As for the rest of you guys. Here's
     <br/>
     what I think of the way you played.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange
     <br/>
     Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating
     <br/>
     a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The
     <br/>
     players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (pointing toward the
     <br/>
     Yellow Jackets' locker
     <br/>
     room)
     <br/>
     They're laughin' at you over there.
     <br/>
     Makin' plans for the evening. They
     <br/>
     never dreamed it'd be this easy. You
     <br/>
     guys are nothin' but bugs splattered
     <br/>
     on their windshield. You better stock
     <br/>
     up on potato chips, 'cause you're
     <br/>
     gonna be watching a lotta T.V. on
     <br/>
     New Years Day.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate
     <br/>
     their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Get warm, Joe. You're startin' the
     <br/>
     second half.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray
     <br/>
     Griffen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     By the way... don't let me see you
     <br/>
     miss anymore blocks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of
     <br/>
     the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the
     <br/>
     stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is
     <br/>
     sacked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Clayton approaches Winters on the sideline.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Joe's too tentative, too cautious
     <br/>
     out there. He seems flat. Maybe we
     <br/>
     oughta give Collins another shot.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Joe just needs to get the feel back.
     <br/>
     He'll be allright.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CLAYTON
     <br/>
     Sam, we can't afford to wait...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (snapping)
     <br/>
     I said he'll be allright.

     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to
     <br/>
     nothing. The Wolves are gonna have
     <br/>
     to find some offense in a hurry here.
     <br/>
     Their defense has been keepin' them
     <br/>
     in it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes
     <br/>
     up to him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Joe, I know that Rehab was good for
     <br/>
     you. Got rid of a lotta bad habits.
     <br/>
     But what about the rest of you? What
     <br/>
     happened to the Joe Kane that used
     <br/>
     to take command of this team, the
     <br/>
     Joe Kane these guys i'd run through
     <br/>
     a bulldozer for? They put him out
     <br/>
     with the trash? What are you waitin'
     <br/>
     for, somebody to feel sorry for you
     <br/>
     cause you've had some problems? Nobody
     <br/>
     in this stadium gives a shit. It's
     <br/>
     time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at
     <br/>
     the head of the Table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     All right, we've held these guys up
     <br/>
     long enough. Give me time back here,
     <br/>
     and I'll rip 'em apart. 16 shift,
     <br/>
     green, bolt. First sound.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!"
     <br/>
     The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the
     <br/>
     sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket,
     <br/>
     scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard
     <br/>
     line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to
     <br/>
     get it to the four, but it's gonna
     <br/>
     bring up fourth and goal. No doubt
     <br/>
     about it, with 3:45 they've gotta go
     <br/>
     for it here, if they're gonna get
     <br/>
     back in this game.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON THE SIDELINE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into
     <br/>
     the huddle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     RAY
     <br/>
     Give it to me up the gut, Coach.
     <br/>
     They've been ignoring me. I know I
     <br/>
     can score.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     No, we're gonna go with the sweep.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is
     <br/>
     upset, angry. He swears to himself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON FIELD
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     28 Thunder right. On 2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the
     <br/>
     defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one
     <br/>
     step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches
     <br/>
     to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker
     <br/>
     comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make
     <br/>
     the block. He drops out of our picture.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Shit!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The
     <br/>
     linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle
     <br/>
     on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder
     <br/>
     to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray
     <br/>
     reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker,
     <br/>
     knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out.
     <br/>
     Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal
     <br/>
     line. Touchdown, E.S.U.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer
     <br/>
     about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to
     <br/>
     talk to his defense.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray,
     <br/>
     grabs him by the helmet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Monster block, man. Monster
     <br/>
     motherfuckin' block.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ALVIN'S SHACK
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ALVIN
     <br/>
     (softly to himself)
     <br/>
     All right, defense. Let's get evil.
     <br/>
     Kill 'em all, let the paramedics
     <br/>
     sort 'em out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Georgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     1:11 and counting. Third and one.
     <br/>
     The Wolves have got to stop them on
     <br/>
     this play if they're gonna get the
     <br/>
     ball back. A first down here and
     <br/>
     it's all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of
     <br/>
     timeouts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands
     <br/>
     off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs
     <br/>
     behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer.
     <br/>
     Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers
     <br/>
     his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a
     <br/>
     fierce yell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision
     <br/>
     lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck,
     <br/>
     vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the
     <br/>
     tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face.
     <br/>
     There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as
     <br/>
     the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling
     <br/>
     their arms, whipping up the crowd.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON SIDELINE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field.
     <br/>
     He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids
     <br/>
     there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done
     <br/>
     it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives
     <br/>
     his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He catches the snap, boots the ball away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline,
     <br/>
     where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he
     <br/>
     reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where
     <br/>
     a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there.
     <br/>
     He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the
     <br/>
     corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a
     <br/>
     wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run
     <br/>
     out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON STANDS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to
     <br/>
     Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Time for 2 plays. If it's not open
     <br/>
     in the end zone, take the sideline.
     <br/>
     As the offense runs onto the field,
     <br/>
     Winters checks the scoreboard. 17
     <br/>
     seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U.
     <br/>
     7.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe brings the Wolves up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17
     <br/>
     seconds left. Kane barking signals.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away
     <br/>
     from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he
     <br/>
     fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and
     <br/>
     goes out of bounds at the twelve.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON SIDELINE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more
     <br/>
     time outs, as the refs move the chains.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     Field goal here ties it, but a tie
     <br/>
     may not get the Wolves into a bowl.
     <br/>
     Tough decision for Winters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     (to Joe)
     <br/>
     You want me to send in the kicking
     <br/>
     team or you think you can handle it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Give me the ball.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     O.K., let's do 24 inside slot, left
     <br/>
     blue lightning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ON FIELD
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as
     <br/>
     the crowd's roar goes off the charts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     (in huddle)
     <br/>
     O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue
     <br/>
     lightning. Let's put the women and
     <br/>
     children to bed, and go lookin' for
     <br/>
     fuckin' dinner. On 2.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all
     <br/>
     they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break
     <br/>
     the huddle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the
     <br/>
     Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at
     <br/>
     the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     This one's for you, Dad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We
     <br/>
     go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing
     <br/>
     everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks
     <br/>
     up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player.
     <br/>
     Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher
     <br/>
     breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime
     <br/>
     as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble
     <br/>
     up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern
     <br/>
     and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one
     <br/>
     tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back
     <br/>
     for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between
     <br/>
     defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen,
     <br/>
     Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open
     <br/>
     space that Darnell is heading for.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker.
     <br/>
     Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close
     <br/>
     on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral.
     <br/>
     Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes
     <br/>
     between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch,
     <br/>
     landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls
     <br/>
     over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This
     <br/>
     time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON STANDS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes
     <br/>
     crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost
     <br/>
     wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing
     <br/>
     none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob
     <br/>
     Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. ALVIN'S SHACK - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches
     <br/>
     off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be
     <br/>
     a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain
     <br/>
     future.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     INT. CHANCELLOR'S SKY-BOX - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory,
     <br/>
     congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the
     <br/>
     Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman
     <br/>
     of the Board of Regents.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHAIRMAN
     <br/>
     Looks like the Timberwolves are back.
     <br/>
     Probably brought the library with
     <br/>
     them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CHANCELLOR
     <br/>
     Hope so.
     <br/>
     (turning to Galen
     <br/>
     Howard)
     <br/>
     Give my sincere congratulations to
     <br/>
     Coach Winters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HOWARD
     <br/>
     He'll be delighted.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund
     <br/>
     football field and starts advancing the ball.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FAT CAT ALUMNUS
     <br/>
     15,10, touchdown!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This brings applause all around.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs
     <br/>
     him, leads him to her dad.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     AUTUMN
     <br/>
     Daddy, you remember Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     Thank you, sir. I got somethin' for
     <br/>
     you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained
     <br/>
     piece of paper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     DARNELL
     <br/>
     My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach
     <br/>
     Winters said you got an 87. He looked
     <br/>
     it up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     MR. HALEY
     <br/>
     (laughing)
     <br/>
     I'll kill him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON JOE KANE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the
     <br/>
     fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters
     <br/>
     comes up next to him.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see
     <br/>
     you back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     And don't worry about the Heisman.
     <br/>
     We'll gear up for it next year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe manages a weary smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON BUD LITE
     <br/>
     <br/>
     coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop
     <br/>
     as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in
     <br/>
     anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him
     <br/>
     and up to Bud.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     You still feel like gettin' a beer?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to
     <br/>
     hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off
     <br/>
     together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of
     <br/>
     his reaction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     LOUANNE
     <br/>
     He's not a football player any more.
     <br/>
     He's graduating this year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     He's still got a bowl game.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     WINTERS
     <br/>
     So make sure he doesn't violate
     <br/>
     curfew.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Louanne smiles. Winters returns it, and walks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ANGLE ON STEVE LATTIMER
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HARVEY (V.O.)
     <br/>
     An amazing conclusion to a great
     <br/>
     season. We can see Steve Lattimer
     <br/>
     down on the bench weeping tears of
     <br/>
     joy as E.S.U. goes back to a bowl
     <br/>
     for the first time in three years.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll
     <br/>
     never be able to play pro football without steroids.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - LATE AFTERNOON
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging
     <br/>
     Quad paths. Camille approaches from the opposite direction,
     <br/>
     stops when she sees Joe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     What are you doin' here?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     Waitin' for you. I figured you'de
     <br/>
     have to come through here on your
     <br/>
     way to dinner.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This softens, relaxes her a bit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     Shouldn't you be out celebrating?
     <br/>
     You played real well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I need your help with somethin'. I
     <br/>
     know I'm not your favorite guy right
     <br/>
     now, but it's all startin' again.
     <br/>
     The expectations, the pressure, the
     <br/>
     talk about the Heisman next year. I
     <br/>
     was wonderin' if you'de like to go
     <br/>
     somewhere, maybe share a six-pack
     <br/>
     with me?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls
     <br/>
     a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in
     <br/>
     spite of herself. They settle again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     JOE
     <br/>
     I miss you, Camille. I don't like
     <br/>
     bein' without you.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAMILLE
     <br/>
     I'll think about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long
     <br/>
     kiss and embrace as we pull up and back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AS
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the
     <br/>
     tunnel to a waiting car. No effigy this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     HUMES
     <br/>
     Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary
     <br/>
     and player profiles in the briefcase.
     <br/>
     We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore
     <br/>
     with the kid from Park. Then we're
     <br/>
     on to...
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season,
     <br/>
     another year in the annals of The Program.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     FADE OUT
     <br/>
     <br/>
     THE END
