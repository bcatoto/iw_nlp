How to Train Your Dragon 2

SNOTLOUT	Oh, I'm sorry, Fishlegs! Did you want that?
FISHLEGS	Snotlout! That's mine!
SNOTLOUT	Here ya go, babe.
SNOTLOUT	Did I tell you that you look amazing today? `Cause you do.
RUFFNUT	Come on, Barf. It's starting to stink around here.
TUFFNUT	Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch!
STOICK	That's nine for the Twins, Astrid lags with three, Fishlegs and Snotlout trail with NONE!
STOICK	And Hiccup is... nowhere to be found. Hmmm. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 3.
GOBBER	Scared him off with the big talk, didn't ya, Stoick?
ASTRID	What are you doing, Snotlout?! They're going to win now!
SNOTLOUT	She's my princess! Whatever she wants, she gets.
ASTRID	Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury you alive?!
SNOTLOUT	Only for a few hours!
STOICK	It's time, Gobber.
GOBBER	Righty-ho! (aloud, to the crowd) Last lap!
ASTRID	The black sheep! Come on, Stormfly! We can still win this thing!
RUFFNUT	Come on, Barf!
TUFFNUT	Let's go!
FISHLEGS	Go, Meatlug!
GOBBER	This is your big moment. Have a nice flight!
ASTRID	Up, up, up!
ASTRID	No!
FISHLEGS	Good job, Meatlug!
FISHLEGS	Here you go, darling. Mine's worth ten! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 5.
RUFFNUT	Yeah! The Black Sheep!
ASTRID	You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!
RUFFNUT	I'm totally winning!
FISHLEGS	We're winning together!
RUFFNUT	No one can stop me now!
TUFFNUT	Except for me. We're attached, genius!
TUFFNUT	Quit trying to steal all my glory!
STOICK	Get `em, Astrid!
TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
ASTRID	Gotcha!
RUFFNUT	Astrid! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 6.
STOICK	Well played! Hahaha! (gloating, to the crowd) That's my future daughter-in-law!
SNOTLOUT	Uh, excuse me.
ASTRID	Stormfly!
STOICK	That's thirteen! Astrid takes the game!
HICCUP	Yeah!
HICCUP	What do you think, bud? Wanna give this another shot?
HICCUP	Toothless! It'll be fine.
HICCUP	Ready? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.
HICCUP	This is amazing!
HICCUP	No longer amazing! Toothless!
HICCUP	Oh, no!
HICCUP	That really came out of nowhere.
HICCUP	We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.
HICCUP	Looks like we found another one, bud.
HICCUP	Oh, what? Do you want an apology? Is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? Well... try this on!
HICCUP	Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?
HICCUP	Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a
ONE-LEGGED--
HICCUP	You're right! You're right! You win! You win!
HICCUP	He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!
HICCUP	Gaaaaagh! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 10.
HICCUP	You KNOW that doesn't wash out.
HICCUP	So what should we name it?
HICCUP	"Itchy Armpit" it is.
HICCUP	Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might find a few Timberjacks in those woods? The odd Whispering Death or two in the rocks? Who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another Night Fury.	Wouldn't that be something?	So, whaddya say? Just keep going?
HICCUP	`Afternoon m'lady. Where have you been?
ASTRID	Winning races. What else? The real question is... where have YOU been?
HICCUP	Avoiding my dad.
ASTRID	Oh, no. What happened now?
HICCUP	Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake up. The sun's shining. Terrible Terrors are singing on the rooftop. I saunter down to breakfast, thinking all is right with the world, and I get...
HICCUP	... Son, we need to talk.
ASTRID	Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day of goofing off to get started.
HICCUP	Okay, first of all, I don't sound like that. What is this character? And second... what is that thing you're doing with my shoulders? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 12.
HICCUP	A truly flattering impersonation. Anyway, he goes... (resuming Stoick's brogue) You're the pride of Berk, son, and I couldn't be prouder...
ASTRID	(continuing her impression
OF HICCUP)	Aw, thanks, Dad. I'm pretty impressed with myself, too.
HICCUP	WHEN have I ever done that with my hands?
ASTRID	You just did.
HICCUP	Okay... just... (holding her arms, mock-
STERN)	Hold still. It's very serious.
HICCUP	(resuming Stoick's brogue) You're all grown up, and since no chief could ask for a better successor, I've decided--
ASTRID	--TO MAKE YOU CHIEF! Oh, my gods!
ASTRID	Hiccup, that's amazing!
HICCUP	You're gonna wear out the spring coil. The calibration is very sensitive! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 13.
HICCUP	Yeah, so... this is what I'm dealing with.
ASTRID	What did you tell him?
HICCUP	I didn't. By the time he turned around, I was gone.
ASTRID	Well, it's a lot of responsibility. The map will have to wait for sure, and I'll need to fly Toothless, since you'll be too busy...
HICCUP	It's not me, Astrid. All those speeches, and planning, and running the village... that's his thing.
ASTRID	I think you're missing the point. I mean, chief. What an honor. I'd be pretty excited.
HICCUP	I'm not like you. You know exactly who you are. You always have. But...
HICCUP	I'm still looking. I know that I'm not my father... and I never met my mother... so, what does that make me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 14.
ASTRID	What you're searching for... isn't out there, Hiccup.
ASTRID	It's in here.	Maybe you just don't see it yet.
HICCUP	Maybe. But, y'know... there is something out there.
ASTRID	Hiccup...
HICCUP	Stay close.
HICCUP	What happened here? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 15.
HICCUP	Easy, bud.
ASTRID	Hiccup!
HICCUP	Astrid! Look out!
ASTRID
ERET	Watch the tail!
ERET	Tie those legs up!
ERET	Is that what I think it is? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 16.
HICCUP
ASTRID
ERET	Back again?
ERET	Soil my britches... that is a Night Fury. Thought they were all gone for good. (to his fellow trappers) Looks like our luck's had a turn for the better, lads! Don't think Drago has one of those in his dragon army.
ASTRID	Dragon army?
HICCUP	Look, we don't want any trouble.
ERET	Ha! You should've thought of that before you stole all of our dragons and blasted our fort to bits!
HICCUP	Wait...
ASTRID	What are you talking about? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 17.
HICCUP	You think we did this?
ERET	Dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is, without do-gooder dragon riders sneaking in to rescue them.
HICCUP	What do-gooder -- there are other dragon riders?
ERET	You mean, other than your thieving friend from last night? You tell me.
ERET	You may have an ice-spitting dragon on your side, but we still have a quota to fill. How do you suppose we explain this mess to Drago Bludvist?
HICCUP	Drago what-fist? Does anything you say make sense?
TEENY	He's expecting a new shipment of dragons for his army by tomorrow.
NO-NAME	And Drago don't take well to excuses.
ERET	This is what he gave me last time I showed up empty-handed. He promised to be far less understanding in the future.
HICCUP	Look, we don't know anything about a dragon thief, or an ice-spitting dragon, or your lunatic boss and his dragon army, okay?	HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 18.
HICCUP	Just give us back our dragon, and we'll go, strange, hostile person whom we've never met.
ERET	Oh, where are my manners? I'm Eret. Son of Eret. Finest dragon trapper alive.
ERET	After all, it's not just anyone who can capture a Night Fury.
HICCUP	And this is Toothless. He says we're going. Now.
ERET	Heh. They all say that.
ASTRID	Stormfly! C'mon, go! Go!
ERET
STOICK	Any sign of him?
GOBBER	Ah, he's probably flown off the edge of the world by now. You sure you want that kid running the village? You can still delay your retirement.
STOICK	Oh, he's ready. You'll see.
STOICK	Haha! There he is! (to Gobber, proving his
POINT)	Huh? The pride of Berk!
GOBBER	Who finally decided to show up for work. Yay.
HICCUP	Sorry. Got held up. (privately, to Stoick) Hey, Dad, could I have a word?
STOICK	Something you're itching to tell me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 20.
HICCUP	Not quite the itch you're thinking of, but yes.
STOICK	Good man! Now, lesson one. A chief's first duty is to his people. So...
STOICK	Forty one? Forty --
HICCUP	Could we just talk in private for--
STARKARD	--That's me! That's me! I'm next! (pushing his way through) I was ahead of you! Excuse me, I've been here all day!
STARKARD	Okay, I want one of those high seaters, with lots of spikes and a big stowage compartment.
STOICK	Absolutely! You got it, sir!
HICCUP	Dad, this is actually a little more important than building saddles.
STOICK	Ah-ah! Lesson two. No task is too small when it comes to serving your people. Excuse us, Grump.
GOBBER	Grump! You let the forge die down again! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 21.
GOBBER	That's it, Grump. You're going up for adoption!
STOICK	One of these. And this...
HICCUP
DAD --
STOICK	-- There you go! Go on. Have away.
HICCUP	But, seriously, I really need to tell you about this new land we came across.
GOBBER	Another one?!
FISHLEGS	Any new dragons?
HICCUP	We didn't stick around to find out. These folks weren't particularly friendly.
GOBBER	Oh, really? Your Night Fury and Deadly Nadder didn't bring them cheering to the rooftops?
HICCUP	No, this was different. Not the standard run-for-the-hills hoo-ha I've come to enjoy. These guys were trappers. Dragon trappers. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 22.
ASTRID	You should've seen their fort. All blown apart and stuck in giant spikes of ice. It was weird.
HICCUP	I've never seen anything like it. And worst of all, they thought we did it!
GOBBER	Y'know, you two are gonna get yourselves in SERIOUS trouble one of these days. Not everyone appreciates this way of life.
STOICK	Gobber's right, son. Best we keep to our own. Besides, you'll have more important uses for your time --
STOICK	(sing-songy, under his
BREATH)	Once we make the big announcement!
HICCUP	They are building a dragon army.
HICCUP	Or at least the guy they work for is. Dargo Bloody Fist or something.
TUFFNUT	I'll bloody his fist with my face if he tries to take my dragon!
RUFFNUT	Or mine. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 23.
TUFFNUT	You're such a moron.
FISHLEGS	A beautiful moron.
SNOTLOUT	Yeah...
STOICK	Bludvist? Drago Bludvist?
HICCUP	Uh, yeah. Wait. You know him?
STOICK
HICCUP	What? Why?!
STOICK
HICCUP	Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait! What is happening?
GOBBER	You heard the man! Lock it down!
STOICK	No DRAGON or VIKING sets foot off this island until I give the word! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 24.
HICCUP	Because some guy you knew is stirring up trouble in some faraway land?
STOICK	Because Drago Bludvist is a madman. Without conscience or mercy. And if he's built a dragon army... gods help us all.
STOICK	Get them into their pens! Quickly!
HICCUP	Then let's ride back out there. We'll follow those trappers to Drago and talk some sense into him.
STOICK	No. We fortify the island.
HICCUP	It's our duty to keep the peace!
STOICK	Peace is over, Hiccup. I must prepare you for war.
HICCUP	War? Dad, if Drago's coming for our dragons, we can't wait around for him to get here. Let's go find him and change his mind.
STOICK	Some minds won't be changed, Hiccup. Berk is what you need to worry about.	A chief protects his own.
STOICK
ASTRID	Hiccup, don't.
HICCUP	I have to.
STOICK
STOICK
HICCUP	Come on!
STOICK	Hiccup!
ERET	Keep your eyes peeled, lads! With this wind, we'll reach Drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! It's no time to be picky. Not if we want to keep our -- HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 26.
UG	Uh... Eret?
ERET
ERET	Net `em, lads! Take `em down!
ERET	You're not getting away this time.
ERET	And here I was worried we might turn up empty-handed.
HICCUP	Nope. It's your lucky day. We give up.
HICCUP	That's one Night Fury, one Deadly Nadder, and...
HICCUP	... two of the finest dragon riders west of Luk Tuk. That oughtta make the boss happy, right?
HICCUP	Excuse us. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 27.
ASTRID	What are you doing?
HICCUP	Toothless, stay.
HICCUP	The dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. They won't be any trouble.
HICCUP	Unless you do that. Wooden boat, big ocean. How's your swimming?
NO-NAME	Not good.
HICCUP	Oops. Almost forgot. Can't have armed prisoners!
ASTRID	How is this a plan?
HICCUP	Just what every dragon trapper needs. One end coats the blade in Monstrous Nightmare saliva. The other sprays Hideous Zippleback gas. All it takes is a spark and... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 28.
HICCUP	Oh, yeah, there you go!
HICCUP	Once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud?
ERET	Give me that!
ERET	What game are you playing?
HICCUP	No game. We just want to meet Drago.
ERET	Why?
HICCUP	Because I'm going to change his mind about dragons.
ASTRID	He can be really persuasive.
HICCUP	Once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.
ERET	Puh! You won't be changing any minds around here. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 29.
HICCUP	I can change yours. Right here. Right now.
HICCUP	May I?
ERET	Dragon riders!
HICCUP	Put me down! Snotlout! What are you doing?
SNOTLOUT	See how well I protect and provide?
TUFFNUT	Aggh! What is with all the nets?!
RUFFNUT	Hey watch it! That was close...
TRANSITION TO:	HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 30.
RUFFNUT	Oh, my.
RUFFNUT	Me likey.
RUFFNUT	Take me.
ASTRID
HICCUP
GOBBER	We're here to RESCUE you!
HICCUP	I DON'T NEED to be rescued!
ERET	Well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship, eh? I am Eret, son of -- HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 31.
ERET	(panting, suffocated) Get... this... thing... off... me!
GOBBER	Anyone else?
GOBBER	That's what I figured.
STOICK	You. Saddle up. We're going home.
HICCUP	No.
STOICK	Of all the irresponsible --
HICCUP	-- I'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! How is that irresponsible?
STOICK
STOICK	Years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced.
RUFFNUT	Stupid.
TUFFNUT	Good one.
STOICK	Aye. We laughed, too...
STOICK	Until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, "Then see how well you do without me!"
STOICK	I... was to only one to escape.
STOICK	Men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.
HICCUP	Maybe.
STOICK	Hiccup...
HICCUP	I'm still going to try.
HICCUP	This is what I'm good at. And if I could change your mind... I can change his, too.	Come on.
ASTRID	Let's go.
STOICK	NO! Lead the others back to Berk. I've had enough mutiny for one day.
RUFFNUT	Ooh, I like that.
STOICK	Ruffnut! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 34.
RUFFNUT	Ugh! Okay!
HICCUP	Don't worry, bud. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise.
HICCUP
HICCUP	Okay.	No sudden moves. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 35.
HICCUP	Hold on, hold on.
HICCUP	Toothless!
HICCUP
HICCUP	We have to head back for my dragon!
HICCUP	Who are you? The Dragon Thief? Drago Bludvist?
HICCUP	Do you even understand what I'm saying? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 37.
HICCUP	Toothless!
HICCUP	It's okay. I'm glad to see you, too, bud. You really had me worried there.
WARRIOR	(whispered, shaken) Hiccup?	Could it be? After all these years? How is this possible?
HICCUP	Uh, should I... should I know you?
WARRIOR	No. You were only a babe...
VALKA	... but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38.
VALKA	Come...
STOICK	Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either.
GOBBER	Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually.
STOICK	You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him...
GOBBER	Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury!
STOICK	Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39.
HICCUP	Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here!
VALKA	This way. Come.
HICCUP	You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?!	I have questions!
VALKA	Come. Quickly!
HICCUP	Where have you been all this time?
HICCUP	What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by...
HICCUP	This is where you've been for twenty years?
HICCUP	You've been rescuing them.
HICCUP	Unbelievable.
VALKA	You're not upset?
HICCUP	What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady.
VALKA	At least I'm not boring... right?
HICCUP	I suppose there is that... (feeble, trailing off) ... one... specific... thing...
VALKA	Do you like it?
HICCUP	I don't have the words.
VALKA	Can I... ? He's beautiful! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 41.
VALKA	Incredible. He might very well be the last of his kind.
VALKA	And look, he's your age! No wonder you get along so well.
VALKA	And retractable teeth? Ah! How did you manage to--
HICCUP	--I found him in the woods. He was shot down and wounded.
VALKA	This Snafflefang lost his leg to one of Drago Bludvist's iron traps. This Raincutter had her wing sliced by razor netting. And this poor Hobblegrunt was blinded by a tree snare... then left to die alone and scared. (re: Toothless' tail) And what of this? Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?
HICCUP	Heh. Well, crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down.
HICCUP	It's okay though. He got me back. (playfully, to Toothless) Right, bud? You couldn't save all of me, could you? You just had to make it even. So... peg leg! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 42.
VALKA	What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?
HICCUP	He didn't take it all that well.
HICCUP	But then... he changed. They all did. Pretty soon everyone back home had dragons of their own.
VALKA	If only it were possible.
HICCUP	No, really, I --
VALKA	-- Believe me, I tried, as well. But people are not capable of change, Hiccup. Some of us... were just born different.
VALKA	Stop! You'll only make it worse!
VALKA	Hiccup!
STOICK	Valka, run! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 44.
VALKA	Don't!
STOICK	Hold on!
STOICK
VALKA	Stoick!
STOICK	Valka...
VALKA	You and your father nearly died that night, all because I couldn't kill a dragon.
HICCUP	Yeah, it runs in the family.
VALKA	It broke my heart to stay away, but I believed you'd be safer if I did. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 45.
HICCUP	How did you survive?
VALKA	Oh, Cloudjumper never meant to harm me. He must've thought I belonged here...
VALKA	In the home of the great Bewilderbeast. The alpha species. One of very few that still exist.	Every nest has its queen, but this is king of all dragons.
VALKA	With his icy breath, this graceful giant built our nest. A safe haven for dragons everywhere.
HICCUP	Wait, that's the ice-spitter? He's responsible for all that destruction?
VALKA	He protects us. We all live under his care. And his command.
VALKA	All but the babies, of course... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 46.
VALKA	... who listen to no one.
VALKA	I've lived among them for twenty years, Hiccup, learning their ways, discovering their secrets...
VALKA	He likes you.
HICCUP	Wow.
VALKA	You must be hungry.
HICCUP	Uh, yeah. I could eat.
VALKA	Good. It's feeding time.
ASTRID	I don't like it. They should've been back with Hiccup by now. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 47.
RUFFNUT	I don't like it either. Eret son of Eret was the man of my dreams. My everything!
SNOTLOUT	But, baby, I grew facial hair for you.
FISHLEGS	Me, too.
ASTRID	What if Drago shot them down? What if they need our help?	We have to find them.
FISHLEGS	What? But Stoick said...
ASTRID	It doesn't matter what he said, if they've all been captured. Come on!
NO-NAME	Do we go back?
ERET	We've nowhere to go! Nothing to sell! And no heads to call our own, if we don't turn up with dragons and fast --
ASTRID	Careful what you wish for!
ERET	What is this?!
ASTRID	A kidnapping.
RUFFNUT	Yay! Can he ride with me? Can he? Can he?
ASTRID	You're gonna show us the way to Drago.
ERET	And help dragon riders sneak into Drago's camp? Just kill me now.
ASTRID	That can be arranged. Stormfly, drop it.
ASTRID	Good girl! Stormfly, fetch.
ERET
ASTRID	Works every time. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 49.
HICCUP	Hey, I thought we were going to eat?
VALKA	(with a mischievous grin) Oh, we are.
HICCUP	And from Dragon Island, I found this archipelago... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 50.
VALKA	When I'm up here, I don't even feel the cold. I just feel...
HICCUP	Free.
VALKA	This is what it is to be a dragon, Hiccup.
HICCUP	It's all well and good to call yourself a dragon.
HICCUP	But can you fly? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 51.
HICCUP	Oh no. Toothless!
HICCUP	Man! Almost! We just about had it that time!
VALKA	Incredible.
HICCUP	Well, not bad yourself.
VALKA	All this time, you took after me. And where was I?	I'm so sorry, Hiccup. Can we start over? Will you give me another chance? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 52.
VALKA	I can teach you all I've learned, these past twenty years. Like...
VALKA	Now you can make those tight turns.
HICCUP	Did YOU know about this?
VALKA	Every dragon has its secrets.
VALKA	And I'll show them all to you. We'll unlock every mystery, find every last species, together, as mother and son.	This gift we share, Hiccup... it bonds us. This is who you are, son. Who we are. We will change the world for all dragons! We will make it a better, safer place!
HICCUP	That sounds... amazing.
HICCUP	This is so great! Now you and I can go talk to Drago -- together! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 53.
VALKA	What? There's no talking to Drago.
HICCUP	But we have to --
VALKA	-- No. We must protect our own.
VALKA	Now come on, we should be getting back.
ERET	Agghh! Okay! I got you here, now get this thing off me!
ASTRID	Never take a toy from a dragon. Don't you know anything?
ERET	Gah! Why does this keep happening to me? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 54.
ASTRID	What's down there?
FISHLEGS	Large diameter bubbles, massive lungs, cold water deep dweller, I'm thinking class five leviathan, maybe six.
HICCUP	Meatlug! What's wrong, girl?
ERET	Get off me!
ERET	Always great to see you, my friend! Keeping warm up here? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 55.
ERET	Well, as you can see, I'm right on time with a new batch of dragons, just like I promised.
SOLDIER #1	Watch out! He's waking up! Keep him steady!
SOLDIER #2	Give me some backup here!
DRAGO	Drop the ropes.
SNOTLOUT	Hookfang!
RUFFNUT	Hey!
ASTRID	What are you doing? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 56.
DRAGO	(quiet, to the dragon) You belong to me now.
ERET	And as an added bonus, I also caught you their riders. No extra charge.
ASTRID	What?! Are you kidding me?!
RUFFNUT	But you were so perfect!
ERET	Turns out, there's a whole bunch of them out there. They --
DRAGO	How many?
ASTRID	Drago doesn't have them after all.
DRAGO
ASTRID	Hundreds! A whole island full!
ERET	I wouldn't worry about it. My men are hunting them down as we speak. They won't know where you're hiding. I promise you that.
ASTRID	Oh, yes they will! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 57.
ASTRID	They know we're missing and they have tracking dragons. If you so much as touch us, Hiccup is gonna
KICK --
DRAGO	-- Hiccup?
ERET	He's not a problem. Really. Trust me.
ASTRID	He's only the son of Stoick the Vast...
ASTRID	... his heir to the throne of Berk... and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen!
DRAGO	Dragon master? I ALONE control the dragons!
TUFFNUT	Nope.
FISHLEGS	Sorry!
ASTRID	And unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his Night Fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters!
RUFFNUT	Then they'll be crying like babies!
SNOTLOUT	Funny and beautiful.
FISHLEGS	Good one, babe! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 58.
TUFFNUT	Yeah. Like babies. They always cry. Real tiny ones...
DRAGO	First there was one rider. And now all of Berk.	And YOU led them to me.
ERET	Drago!
DRAGO
ERET	You're overreacting!
DRAGO	And get rid of him.
ERET	Drago, please...
ASTRID
ASTRID
HICCUP	Well, bud, we can't wait around for Drago to attack this place. We've gotta find him first. Let's go.
STOICK	Easy now.
HICCUP	Are you kidding me? How'd you get in here?
STOICK	The same way we're getting you out.
HICCUP	We?
GOBBER	All clear!
STOICK	Toothless. Come.
HICCUP	Dad! There's something you need to know!
STOICK	Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.
HICCUP	This isn't an on-the-way kind of update, actually... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 60.
STOICK	I've heard ENOUGH, Hiccup.
HICCUP	... more of the earth-shattering development variety.
STOICK	Yeah, just add it to the pile.
HICCUP	Dad, unlike most surprises I spring on you, this is one you'll like. I promise! You just have to handle it delicately, so...
GOBBER	Uh, you might want to take this one. Oh, boy.
HICCUP	Dad, can you put the sword away... please?
VALKA	I know what you're going to say, Stoick. How could I have done this? Stayed away all of these years. And why didn't I come back to you? To our son.
VALKA	Well, what sign did I have that you could change, Stoick? That anyone on Berk could?	HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 61.
VALKA	I pleaded so many times to stop the fighting, to find another answer, but did any of you listen?
GOBBER	This is why I never married.	This and one other reason.
VALKA	I know that I left you to raise Hiccup alone... but I thought he'd be better off without me. And I was wrong, I see that now, but...
VALKA	Oh stop being so stoic, Stoick. Go on... SHOUT, SCREAM, SAY SOMETHING!
STOICK	You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
SNOTLOUT	Could this day get any worse?
TUFFNUT	Uh, let me see. You'll jump into freezing cold water and then die from drowning.
ERET	Looks refreshing.
ERET	Please, ladies first.
ASTRID	You are a steaming heap of dragon --
ERET	-- Duck.
SOLDIER	Warn the others!
RUFFNUT	Get `em, you son of an Eret! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 63.
RUFFNUT	Okay, I love you again.
TUFFNUT	Ugh. Pathetic. You can still jump.
ERET	So? Are we going to save your dragons and get out of here or not?
ERET	Check every trap. They're here somewhere.
ASTRID	Meatlug?
ERET	Anyone coming?
RUFFNUT	I don't know. You just keep doing what you're doing. Keep crankin'... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 64.
ERET	Thank you for saving my life.	Now let me return the favor.
HICCUP	Mom, you'd never recognize it! Where we used to make weapons, we now build saddles, wing slings -- we even fix dragon teeth! You wouldn't believe how much everything's changed!
STOICK	Our son's changed Berk for the better. I think we did well with this one, Val.
HICCUP	Thanks, Dad.
VALKA	I'm... a little out of practice.
STOICK	Well, y'know... I didn't marry you for your cooking.
GOBBER	(to Hiccup and Grump) I hope not. Her meatballs could kill more beasts than a battle axe.	HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 65.
GOBBER	I've still got a few knocking around in here. Ha ha!
HICCUP	And once you move back in, with all of your dragons, Drago won't even stand a chance. Everything will be okay!
STOICK	Slow down, son. It's a lot to take in.
HICCUP	Oh. Gotcha.
GOBBER	Oh, I love this one!
STOICK	Remember our song, Val?
STOICK	I'll swim and sail on savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 66.
STOICK	No scorching sun, nor freezing cold
WILL --
GOBBER	-- will stop me on my journey! (catching himself,
EMBARRASSED)	Sorry.
STOICK	If you will promise me your heart...
STOICK	And love...
VALKA	And love me for eternity.
VALKA	My dearest one, my darling dear, you mighty words astound me. But I've no need of mighty deeds, when I feel your arms around me.
STOICK	But I would bring you rings of gold. I'd even sing you poetry.	HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 67.
STOICK	And I would keep you from all harm, if you'd stay here beside me.
VALKA	I have no use for rings of gold. I care not for your poetry. I only want your hand to hold. I only want you near me.
GOBBER	C'mon, Hiccup!	To love and kiss, to sweetly hold. For the dancing and the dreaming. Through all life's sorrows and delights, I'll keep your love inside me.	I'll swim and sail through savage seas, with ne'er a fear of drowning. And gladly ride the waves of life, if you will marry me!
GOBBER	I'm still going...
HICCUP	Gobber!
GOBBER	I'm done.
STOICK	Ah... I thought I'd have to die before we'd have that dance again. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 68.
VALKA	No need for drastic measures.
STOICK	For you, my dear... anything.
STOICK	Will you come home, Val? Will you be my wife once again?
STOICK	We can be a family! What do you say?
VALKA	Yes!
GOBBER	Great! I'll do the cooking!
STOICK	Thank Odin you didn't listen to me, son. We never would have found each other.
HICCUP	Toothless?
HICCUP	What's happening? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 69.
HICCUP	Oh, no...
STOICK	Val! It's all right, it's all right. We're a team now.	Now what do you want to do?
VALKA	We have to save the dragons.
STOICK	Aye. You got it!
STOICK	Come on, son.
DRAGO	Whatever comes, keep hitting the mountain! We need to draw the alpha out. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 70.
DRAGO	Ready the traps!
TUFFNUT	Surprise! Yeah!
DRAGO
ASTRID	You really are full of surprises.
ASTRID	Let's go!
TUFFNUT	Dragon Riders coming through!
DRAGO
RUFFNUT	Eret, son of Eret! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 71.
ASTRID	Up, girl! To the left, Eret! That's it! Look out!
ARCHER	Take `em down!
GOBBER	Heads up!
DRAGO	Dragon Master.
HICCUP	Welcome aboard, dragon rider!
ERET	Thanks. I think.
ASTRID	Where have you been?
HICCUP	Oh, y'know. Catching up with Mom. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 72.
ERET	Whoa...
ASTRID	That's your mother?!
HICCUP	Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.
DRAGO	The alpha! Now we have a fight!
HICCUP	There! Come on, Toothless! Show them what you got, bud.
HICCUP	Thatta boy!
DRAGO	I've waited a long time for this! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 73.
VALKA	You cannot take our dragons! They are controlled by the alpha!
DRAGO	Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger.
HICCUP	Another one?
FISHLEGS
VALKA	No. No.
DRAGO	Come on! Take down the alpha!
VALKA	Thank you.
STOICK	For you, my dear... anything. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 74.
STOICK	Val, do you think you can stop them?
VALKA	I'll do my best! Come on, Cloudjumper!
DRAGO	You... I watched you burn!
STOICK	It takes more than a little fire to kill me!
GOBBER	Stoick!
VALKA	No!
DRAGO	We've won. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 75.
DRAGO	Now finish her!
STOICK	No!
STOICK	Hold on!
STOICK	Skullcrusher, go! Come on, Gobber!
GOBBER	Right behind ya, Stoick!
HICCUP	STOP! Stop! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 76.
DRAGO	This... is the great dragon master? The son of Stoick the Vast? What shame he must feel.
HICCUP	All of this loss, and for what? To become unstoppable? To rule the world?
HICCUP	Dragons are kind, amazing creatures that can bring people together.
DRAGO	Or tear them apart.
DRAGO	You see, I know what it is to live in fear. To see my village burned, my family taken.
DRAGO	But even as a boy, left with nothing, I vowed to rise above the fear of dragons and liberate the people of this world.
HICCUP	Then why a dragon army?
DRAGO	(grinning, smug) Well, you need dragons to conquer other dragons.
HICCUP	Or maybe you need dragons to conquer people.	To control those who follow you... and to get rid of those who won't. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 77.
DRAGO	Clever boy.
HICCUP	The world wants peace. And we have the answer, back on Berk. Just let me show you.
DRAGO	NO! Let ME show YOU.
STOICK	What...?
STOICK	Hiccup!
STOICK	Come on, Gobber!
GOBBER	Okay, change of plans.
DRAGO	No dragon can resist the alpha's command. So he who controls the alpha, controls them all. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 78.
HICCUP	Toothless? You okay, bud? What's going on?
DRAGO	Witness true strength. The strength of will over others. In the face of it, you are nothing.
HICCUP	Uh, what did he just tell you?
HICCUP	Toothless, what's the matter with you? What're you doing?
HICCUP	Knock it off! Stop! Snap out of it!
HICCUP	Toothless! No! Toothless! Don't! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 79.
STOICK	Hiccup!
HICCUP
STOICK
HICCUP
HICCUP	Dad!
VALKA	Stoick...
HICCUP	No... you...
HICCUP	No! Get away from him! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 80.
HICCUP
VALKA	It's not his fault. You know that.
DRAGO
HICCUP	Toothless!
VALKA	No, don't!
DRAGO	Move out! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 81.
HICCUP	I'm sorry, Dad.
HICCUP	I'm not the chief that you wanted me to be. And I'm not peacekeeper I thought I was. I don't know... HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 82.
VALKA	You came early into this world. You were such a wee thing. So frail, so fragile. I feared you wouldn't make it.
VALKA	But your father... he never doubted. He always said you'd become the strongest of them all.	And he was right.	You have the heart of a chief and the soul of a dragon. Only you can bring our worlds together. That is who you are, son.
HICCUP	I was so afraid of becoming my dad. Mostly because I thought I never could. How do you become someone that great? That brave? That selfless?	I guess you can only try. (to the others) A chief protects his own. We're going back.
TUFFNUT	Uh, with what?
RUFFNUT	He took all the dragons.
HICCUP	Not all of them.
RUFFNUT	Fly straight!
FISHLEGS	I don't want to die!
TUFFNUT	We can't fly these things!
FISHLEGS	Yeah, no kidding!
ASTRID	But won't that Bewilderbeast just take control of these guys, too?
HICCUP	They're babies. They don't listen to anyone!
TUFFNUT	Yeah, just like us!
GOBBER	This... is... very dangerous!
GOBBER	Some might suggest this is poorly conceived.
HICCUP	Well, it's a good thing that I never listen.
GOBBER	So what IS your plan?!
HICCUP	Get Toothless back and kick Drago's- HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 84.
GOBBER	Heads up!
HICCUP	And that thing.
HOARK	Ah, that's a good boy!
HOARK	Watch the furniture! Where are you going? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 85.
DRAGO	Your chief is dead.
DRAGO	No one can protect you now.
HICCUP	No...
FISHLEGS	He took all the dragons!
HICCUP	Distract the alpha. Try to keep his focus off of Toothless.
TUFFNUT	Uh... how?
ERET	Have you forgotten who you're riding with? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 86.
ERET	There isn't a dragon alive that I can't wrangle!
ERET	Except for this one!
SNOTLOUT	Amateur.
VIKING #1	Look, it's Hiccup!
DRAGO	What?
RUFFNUT	Keep `em coming!
SNOTLOUT	Black sheep, baby! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 87.
SNOTLOUT	Ten points!
SNOTLOUT	Uh-oh...
FISHLEGS	I'm okay!
DRAGO	You certainly are hard to get rid of. I'll say that.
HICCUP	Toothless? It's me, bud. It's me. I'm right here. Come back to me.
DRAGO	He is not yours anymore. He belongs to the alpha!
DRAGO	But, please, oh great dragon master, try to take him. He will not miss a second time. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 88.
HICCUP	It wasn't your fault, bud. They made you do it.
HICCUP	You'd never hurt him.	You'd never hurt me.
DRAGO	How are you doing that?
HICCUP	Please. You are my best friend, bud.
HICCUP	My best friend.
HICCUP	Thatta boy! That's it! I'm here!
DRAGO	No!
HICCUP	Yeah! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 89.
HICCUP	Hang on!
HICCUP	Almost there, buddy. Almost there!
DRAGO	Do something!
HICCUP	We need to get those two apart.
HICCUP	We gotta block him out, Toothless. Do you trust me, bud?
HICCUP	We can do this. You and me. As one.
HICCUP	That's it. Now let's try this one more time! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 90.
ASTRID	Take them down, babe!
VALKA	Go get `em.
DRAGO	Take control of it!
HICCUP	Shut it out, Toothless!
DRAGO
HICCUP
HICCUP	Not again.
HICCUP	Come on, bud!
HICCUP	Hold on!
HICCUP	Yeah! We did it!
DRAGO	Agghh!
HICCUP	Hold him there Toothless!
HICCUP	It's all over now.
DRAGO	Or is it?
HICCUP	Oh, no! HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 92.
VALKA	No! No...
HICCUP	He's challenging the alpha!
VALKA	To protect you. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 93.
DRAGO	No, no, no, no! Fight back! Fight!
DRAGO	(to the defecting dragons) What's the matter with you?
HICCUP	Now do you get it? This is what it is to earn a dragon's loyalty.	Let this end now.
DRAGO	Never! Come on!
DRAGO
HICCUP	The alpha protects them all. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 94.
HICCUP	You never cease to amaze me, bud. Thank you.
HICCUP	Toothless! You know that doesn't wash out.
ASTRID	Stormfly!
GOBBER	Oh, give me a cuddle, Grumpy!
FISHLEGS	Who's my little princess? HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 95.
FISHLEGS	I missed you so much!
SNOTLOUT	Don't you ever leave again, Hookfang!
RUFFNUT	Oh Barf!
RUFFNUT	Not you.
ERET	That was some pretty fine dragon wrangling back there. You'd make a good trapper.
HICCUP	Y'know, Skullcrusher's gonna need somebody to look after him now.
ERET	Me?
ERET	I'd be honored.
VALKA	Your father... he'd be every bit as proud as I am. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 96.
HICCUP	Thank you. I'm really glad you're here, Mom.
VALKA	And here I'll stay.
ASTRID	See? I told you it was in here.
HICCUP	Ha, ha. Still doing that one? That's hilarious.	Come here, you.
GOBBER	Ooh.
GOBBER	The chief has come home!
