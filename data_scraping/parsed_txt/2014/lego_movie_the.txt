LEGO Movie, The

NARRATOR	No one knows where it came from. There had been others. Mysterious relics of another world. But only one with the power to stop the world.
NARRATOR	Many vied for its dark magic. A few brave souls endeavoured to hide it from those who would use it for ill. Until finally, thankfully it was lost to history.
NARRATOR	Ours is a story of a world that knows not where it comes from. That cannot imagine what it is capable of. Perhaps you can relate. I know I can.
INDY	The Black Falcon. I should've known.
BLACK FALCON	Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this place? Must have been a bunch of lazy hippies, sitting around a table agreeing with each other.
INDY	It was built by the ancients. With more wisdom and artistry than you can ever know.
BLACK FALCON	The Kragle...
INDY	That belongs to the Maker. It must be protected!
BLACK FALCON	What a lame boyscout thing to say! You're standing before the most powerful object in the world and you don't want to use it? You're a real nerd, Indiana Jones.
INDY	The MasterBuilders will learn of this.
BLACK FALCON	And what do you know of them?
INDY	Only that they will be your undoing.
BLACK FALCON	Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French for ciao.
INDY	The Black Falcon has the Kragle.
KRAV M'GA	Gemini. Find the Chosen One.
GEMINI	Okay.
INDY	They followed me...
KRAV M'GA	GO! NOW!
DORIS	Emmet!
DORIS	Did you clean your room?! The cleaning woman is coming today!
DORIS	Because I want her to know what a nice rule-following son I have!
EMMET	Mom!
DORIS	Aw, it is clean.
EMMET	It's always clean!
DORIS	Just like I taught you.
EMMET	What's the point of having my own apartment across the hall from your apartment if you're going to check up on me like I still live at home?
DORIS	I just love you and want my son to be safe and happy. Can't you work from home? Like a sociopath or children's book author?
EMMET	Mom. I've spent my whole life here. I need to go out there and follow my dream of fitting in and being like everybody else.
DORIS	My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon you'll meet a girl and be married!
EMMET	Mom, please!
DORIS	I'm just saying, it's been how many years since Lucy?
EMMET	(changing the subject) Mom... I had the dream again.
FLASH TO:
KIDS	That's the guys who drew a face. / What a weirdo. / He doesn't know how to follow instructions. / He's not invited to my birthday.
DORIS	I hated that day. The kids were so mean, the school tried to expel you... I promised myself I'd never let anything like that happen to you again. And it hasn't. So you need to let your memory of that day go. It never happened.
EMMET	I just want to be normal, Mom.
DORIS	Listen. You're my son. And you're the most normal, regular, average person I know.
EMMET	You mean it?
DORIS	Yeah.
EMMET	Are you crying?
DORIS	No. Yes. Emmet...
DORIS	Don't forget dinner.
EMMET	Promise.
DORIS	Be safe.
EMMET	Of course.
DORIS	Don't make waves.
EMMET	I never do.
DORIS	And follow the instructions.
EMMET	Always.
DORIS	If they weren't so firm and flush with your head, I would pinch your cheeks right now.
EMMET	Love you, Mom.
DORIS	Love you.
RADIO DJ	It's another beautiful day in Legopolis and on Empura Radio. Reminding you don't forget to re- elect President Iamnotarobot for President of the City on Tuesday. Now, for the 258th consecutive week at #1, here's the No News Gnus with their hit "Everything is Awesome."
EMMET	Yeah. I love this song! And so does everyone else!
EMMET	Hello.

EMMET	You creative types! So delightfully sardonic!
BARRISTA	I push one of two buttons on a machine. I would hardly call that creative. I would call that following instructions.
EMMET	But it says Kreative right on your shirt! With an extra "kreative" spelling aberration! I totally don't get it!
FOREMAN	Alright, kid. Here's the rules.
EMMET	Ooh, great.
FOREMAN	Stay on your feet--
EMMET	Mmm hmm.
FOREMAN	Stick to the instructions--
EMMET	Uh huh.
FOREMAN	And don't get creative!
EMMET	Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!
FOREMAN	It's Sean.
FOREMAN	The pieces get sent down from corporate bundled together with the instructions. Take the one with your section on it and follow it to the letter. Keep track of all the pieces. If you lose one of the special ones it'll seriously drive you crazy.
FOREMAN	Today you'll be putting together an artists' loft.
EMMET	Is it for an artist?
FOREMAN	Oh, no. It's for an accountant.
EMMET	Oh, great.
FOREMAN	Pretty soon, the whole city will look like this. All part of some big master plan from Central.
EMMET	Wow...
EMMET	What if I mess up or lose my place or something?
FOREMAN	Just do what everyone else does. Keep your head down, follow instructions, and you could get promoted. Central's got some big project coming up overseas.
EMMET	Overseas? I don't know. I'm not big on travel.
FOREMAN	Whatever, kid.
EMMET	One more question.
EMMET	Thank you. For making my dreams come true.
FOREMAN	Is that a question?
EMMET	So.

EMMET	I think I know why I like that song so much.
LUNCH CONSUMER	Why's that?
EMMET	Because everything is awesome.
LUNCH CONSUMERS	Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never thought of it like that.
FOREMAN	Kid! What the heck is that?!
EMMET	Oh, uh. I don't know. What?
FOREMAN	That's not the instructions.
EMMET	I don't know what happened. I was just looking out at the clouds, and-- It was an accident.
FOREMAN	We got a loose brick! Code Danger!
EMMET	Code Danger? What's so dangerous?
EMMET	Oh.
POLICEMAN	Loose brick!
POLICEMAN'S PARTNER	Loose brick!
POLICE CHIEF	Stop that building!
EMMET	--unbelievably sorry. I am honestly the last person who would do something like thi--
EMMET	--eriously, a model citizen. I got straight As. I vote! Even in the off-year elections, for school board and stuff--
EMMET	--swear, I'm not special at all. Just ask my mom! I'm a totally average normal person!
BAD COP	Oh yeah? What size coffee do you drink?
EMMET	Super grande.
BAD COP	Dammit! I can't break him.
EMMET	You don't need to break me! I'm just a regular old totally
UNSPECIAL LAW-ABIDING--
EMMET	I'm Emmet. What's your name?
CONVICT	17.
TV ANCHOR	...we're still following the story of the construction worker who got a little creative on his first day on the job. The subject was described as looking and acting exactly like everybody else... Police have taken the nondescript suspect into custody, and he is being held in the city jail.
EMMET	Mom? What are you doing here?
DORIS	I'm breaking you out.
EMMET	But, that's breaking the rules. You told me never to do that.
DORIS	Well I'm temporarily reversing my position for reasons of convenience.
EMMET	What?
DORIS	The rules are different now.
EMMET	But I did something really bad.
DORIS	No you didn't.
EMMET	Mom. You taught me to be a person of principle, and I stand by my principles of doing whatever authority tells me to.
DORIS	Great. Fine. Would you mind holding my purse?
EMMET	Sure.
EMMET	Wh-- what are you doing?
DORIS	Saving your life.

EMMET	You can't protect me my whole life.
DORIS	You wanna bet? Come on.
EMMET	Mom, I'm going back to jail to repay my debt to society. A society that I would like to be a part of.
DORIS	You have to trust me--
EMMET	You have to trust me! I'm my own person. You have to let me grow up and make my own choices--
DORIS	I tried, and look what happened!
EMMET	Maybe if you didn't mother me so much I'd have been a little better equipped. Ever think of that?
DORIS	As a matter of fact I did. All the time.
EMMET	Ugh. You know what you are, Mom? You want to really know? A real pain in the elbow!
DORIS	Emmet!
EMMET	LEAVE ME ALONE!
DORIS	EMMET!!!
EMMET	Mom? Mom!!!!
GEMINI	Where did she go?!
EMMET	What's happening?!
EMMET	How did you--
EMMET	My mom got kidnapped by ninjas then a lady turned a mailbox into a motorcycle and now we have to catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.
BARRISTA	Get in, I guess?
BARRISTA	What's with the purse?
EMMET	It's my mom's.
DORIS	What do you want with me?!
NINJA #1	You know what we want.
DORIS	You have the wrong person!
NINJA #1	Do we?
EMMET	Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm going to save you!
GEMINI	Stop, Emmet! You're going to screw everything up!
EMMET	No, I'm not! How do you know my name?
LARRY	What the FLIPPING FLIP IS
EMMET	You're breaking the speed limit, you know. Not to mention several other laws, as a well as a few other things that are not written into law per se, but are accepted social practices.
GEMINI	Emmet.
EMMET	Lucy?
LUCY	It's Gemini now.
EMMET	Are you a DJ?
LUCY	No.
EMMET	So, uh, how have the last seven years been?
LUCY	Okay.
DORIS	Emmet?!	Don't you dare hurt him.
EMMET	So. I have a lot of questions.
LUCY	Is this really the best time to talk?
EMMET	Well, so far...
LUCY	Fine. Shoot.
EMMET	Why did those ninjas take my mom? Why are there ninjas? Are they robotic ninjas? Where have you been the last seven years? When did you gain magical superpowers? Why did you change your name to Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you ask me. Also, have you been following me around this whole time? Because that's pretty weird considering last time I saw you was when you dumped me for absolutely no reason.
BARRISTA	You guys used to date? Nice.
LUCY	Hardly.
EMMET	Oh try all of 8th grade!
BARRISTA	Burn.
BARRISTA	How do you do that?
LUCY	By the way, I'm seeing someone now, so don't get any ideas.
EMMET	I never have any ideas.
EMMET	Oh, thank goodness, the police are here.
EMMET	Never mind.
LUCY	You don't get it, do you?
EMMET	Get what?
LUCY	They're here for the Chosen One.
EMMET	The Chosen One? What the heck is that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep telling everyone- I'm just a regular guy!
LUCY	Not you. Your mom.
EMMET	Oh. Really?
LUCY	I was sent to get her, but they got to her first.
EMMET	You're sure I'm not the Chosen One?
LUCY	Emmet, your mother is the most powerful being in the universe.
EMMET	But-- how-- she has cankles!
LUCY	Don't we all.
LUCY	She and I belong to an ancient brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who create from our imaginations, not instructions, forced underground by evil forces. She has long been in hiding to protect you from those forces. I was sent to summon her, but when I showed up she was too busy breaking you out of prison.
EMMET	Okay I did not understand a lot of that.
LUCY	Just hold the wheel.
BARRISTA	So. What's happening?
LUCY	How... Emmet! Jump!
EMMET	Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
LUCY	It didn't break. How?
EMMET	She's gone. I can't believe she's gone... because she tried to protect me...?
BAD COP	Send everyone you can out hunting for that kid and whoever is trying to help him. You hear me?!	He's wanted... broken or together.
LARRY	I need a coffee.
EMMET	Who exactly are these evil forces my mom was trying to protect me from? And why are the cops in league with robot ninjas?
LUCY	You have a lot of questions.
EMMET	I'm just getting warmed up.
LUCY	They all work for the Black Falcon.
EMMET	The Black Falcon?
LUCY	Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?
EMMET	Empura? I love their stuff.
LUCY	He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms. He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all.
EMMET	My mom. My mom?
LUCY	Emmet, did your mom have a safe deposit box, a safe, something where she would have hidden something very valuable?
EMMET	No. The only thing she had that was worth anything was her purse. She takes it with her everywhere. Unfortunately it's now melted to my arm. Ow!
LUCY	(pulling out items) No...no...no...no...no...no... No...no...no...no...no...no...
EMMET	Well, I guess it's not in there--
LUCY	No...no...no...no...no...no...
LUCY	It's not in there.
LUCY	What's her birthday?
EMMET	November twenty-second.
LUCY	Of course. Your birthday. January six.
EMMET	You remember?
LUCY	Not by choice.
LUCY	The MasterPiece.
EMMET	What is this thing? It's... beautiful.
LUCY	Some say it's the first piece ever. No one knows exactly what it does, but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world.
EMMET	And by that you mean my mom.
LUCY	There's an inscription.
EMMET	One will come from land afar, With hand besmirched in shape of star. One to confront a great forsaker, And build a bridge to meet the Maker. This one will make the world right, But first there'll be an awesome fight.
LUCY	The prophecy of the Chosen One...
EMMET	Who is my Mom.
LUCY	Yes. We have to get this to your mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all.
EMMET	And if it weren't for me, she'd be here and everything would be okay.
SMASH TO:
CREATURE	Finn? I thought I told you not to touch anything...
EMMET	What was that?
LUCY	What was what?
LUCY	We have to go. NOW.
EMMET	Where are we going?!
LUCY	We're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help.
EMMET	The MasterBuilders council?
LUCY	No. They're gone. All of them.
EMMET	Then who?
LUCY	Vitruvius. He was once a great MasterBuilder, now he's...retired. But he's our only hope.
EMMET	Can't you do it on your own? You were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!
LUCY	I can't, I'm...still in training. I'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet. Technically, I'm an intern.
EMMET	Well well well--
EMMET	You're not going to cross the city limits, are you?
LUCY	Don't be a putz, Emmet.
EMMET	Everyone knows you're not allowed to go Out of Town. It's dangerous, uncharted and no one should ever go that's what everybody says. Can't we just explain the situation to President Iamnotarobot?
LUCY	Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever notice how metallic he looks?
EMMET	Come on. He's just very fair skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot" in his very name! Besides, he's way better than Councilman Strawman. That guy is the pits.
LUCY	Don't be na�ve.
EMMET	What's na�ve?
LUCY	That.
LUCY	Look, just give me the MasterPiece and I'll take it from here.
EMMET	My mom gave it to me and I'm not giving it to anyone unless their name is My Mom.
LUCY	Well then I guess you're going to have to cross that line.
EMMET	Well then I guess I am.
LUCY	Well then go ahead and do it.
EMMET	Well then go ahead and do it I shall.
LUCY	Dude!
EMMET	Okay, okay.
LUCY	Not everything is what it seems...
EMMET	Who are those guys?
LUCY	Annoying short whiners. Plus they reproduce like crazy. It's a real problem.
EMMET	Where are we? Where are all the buildings? And coffee shops?
LUCY	Legopolis is only one realm in the Black Falcon's dominion. He built walls around all of them so he can keep them separate. If the walls came down, he'd have a hard time controlling the results. The MasterBuilders built secret passages through the walls so we could travel between lands.
EMMET	Who are they?
LUCY	The Black Falcon's sentries. They're looking for us.
EMMET	So he controls all these worlds?
LUCY	Shh!
ASSISTANT	The Black Falcon will see you now.
BLACK FALCON	Doris! Did someone get you a water?
DORIS	You'll never get away with this.
BLACK FALCON	"You'll never get away with this!" What a clich�! You don't even know what it is I'm trying to get away with. Maybe you should listen more.
DORIS	I'm all ears.
BLACK FALCON	Truly? Because listening and hearing are not the same thing.
DORIS	I'm listening.
BLACK FALCON	Excellent.	Behold, the Kragle!
DORIS	The car in the city. That's why it didn't break...
BLACK FALCON	Very good. But there's a lot more to my plan than that. Check it:
BLACK FALCON	Here is your typical family. You there. Move your arm a little higher. A little higher... NO NO NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are all PATHETIC LOSERS!
BLACK FALCON	Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an inch. You see how hard it is for me? I have to make all these plans and rules and enforce them on people. It's whack-a-mole. I get one thing perfect, and then another thing gets messed up. Ay ay ay I get so tired!
DORIS	You never did understand the way of the Maker.
BLACK FALCON	Sure I do. There's one right way to do everything, and I know it, and everyone else is wrong and is trying to screw me up! Until now.
BLACK FALCON	You. Introduce yourselves to me.
"DAD"	I'm sorry?
BLACK FALCON	Like, you say to me "Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa."
"DAD"	But you just said it.
BLACK FALCON	Well, just-- you say it now.
"DAD"	Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this
IS MARY--
BLACK FALCON	My wife Mary.
"DAD"	My wife, Mary.
BLACK FALCON	And our children...
"DAD"	And our kids--
BLACK FALCON	Children.
"DAD"	And our children Mark and Lisa.
BLACK FALCON	All together now.
"DAD"	< SIGH > Hello Black Falcon I'm Dale, this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa.
BLACK FALCON	Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!
BLACK FALCON	Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA! And it's totally permanent!
DORIS	You want to do this to the whole world?
BLACK FALCON

BLACK FALCON
BLACK FALCON	Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to that call, he's going to get his butt kicked. He'll fit in, alright. Into a coffin!
DORIS	Leave him out of this!
BLACK FALCON	I would, but I'm pretty sure he has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in your apartment, and it's not on you. But your son seems to have interesting taste in handbags.
BLACK FALCON	So, just to tie up all the loose ends, I'll have to kill him and take the MasterPiece so the prophecy will never come true.
DORIS	No! Don't, please! I'll do what you want, please don't hurt him.
BLACK FALCON	Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do what I want regardless. I'll simply use my very special electromagnetic machine to extract your thoughts and steal your ideas like I've done for all the other imprisoned MasterBuilders.
DORIS	No!
BLACK FALCON	Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!
EMMET	Is it much farther?
LUCY	Do you ever say something that isn't a stupid question?
EMMET	What's that supposed to mean?
LUCY	I guess not.
LUCY	That's Dragon.
EMMET	Who could live here?
LUCY	A blind man.
VITRUVIUS	Hello! What? Hi!
EMMET	I see.
EMMET	Lovely place.
VITRUVIUS	Thank you. I am deprived of my sight, but my hearing is so acute that I can still perceive the physical world using echolocation.
EMMET	Like an old bat...
VITRUVIUS	Precisely. I see with my ears. Now, how can I help you, extremely tall and fat stranger?
EMMET	My mother has been kidnapped and it's all my fault.
VITRUVIUS	Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.
LUCY	His mother is the Chosen One. I was sent to summon her. The Black Falcon got to her first. He has the Kragle.
VITRUVIUS	Oh my. That is grave news indeed. But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm sure the active MasterBuilders are more than adequate.
LUCY	The other MasterBuilders are gone.
VITRUVIUS	I guess I'm not redundant anymore.
EMMET	Why is he being so weird?
VITRUVIUS	The Black Falcon was my student.
TEEN DORIS	Hey Rod. What's that?
VITRUVIUS	They were probably right.
EMMET	You taught my parents...
VITRUVIUS	Your mother went into hiding to protect you. Your father never had a chance...
LUCY	Vitruvius, you can still help us.
VITRUVIUS	That's flattery, my dear. We both know you're only here because you have no other place to go.
EMMET	We're here because we don't know what to do and you might. Sir, all I've ever wanted was to get along with everyone and be a part of the world and now I don't know if there's going to be a world to be a part of. That is, unless you help me fix it. And I bet if you do, they'll forget all about what they used to think of you.
VITRUVIUS	I wish I could, young man, but he has the Kragle, and he has the Chosen One, and if he has the Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece. And without that, there is no--
LUCY	Hope?
VITRUVIUS	The Kragle is the most powerful relic of the Maker.
EMMET	Who is this Maker you guys keep talking about?
VITRUVIUS	The Maker. The being who put us all together and watches over us. Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder.
EMMET	Okay that sounds super weird.
VITRUVIUS	It is, but then all the best things are.
EMMET	And what's the Kragle again?
VITRUVIUS	Every so often, the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique, unlike any other. This crystal table is but one example. Some of them, in the wrong hands, can be weaponized. The Kragle, if harnessed, could--
EMMET	--destroy the world?
VITRUVIUS	Yes. The Black Falcon has taken your mother, the one person who can stop him, and imprisoned her.
VITRUVIUS	If we can travel across sea and land, penetrate his heavily- guarded fortress, unkidnap Master Doris, and bring the MasterPiece safely to her, she can use it to destroy the Kragle, and set the world right.
EMMET	Oh is that all we have to do? That doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I forgot to mention, I am saying this with a sarcastic inflection.
LUCY	That's super constructive, thank you.
VITRUVIUS	We need to assemble a team of all remaining MasterBuilders hiding throughout the lands. We'll scour the countryside high and low, overturning rocks, hiding from sentries, avoiding the major roads and air..
LUCY	We don't have that kind of time!
VITRUVIUS	Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list, and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint.
EMMET	Better.
VITRUVIUS	And then, we sail for the Land of Unused Parts!	Anybody got a ship?
EMMET	How long has your boyfriend had his own ship?
LUCY	Why do you care?
EMMET	I just think it's interesting that you're attracted to someone with his own vessel. Fairly superficial to date a guy with his own yacht.
LUCY	It's not exactly a yacht.
NECKBEARD	Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!
EMMET	Huh. Not what I expected.
EMMET	Really not what I expected.
NECKBEARD	Arr! Come give your weary boyfriend a kiss!
EMMET	Wow.
EMMET	Okay. That's-- okay.
LUCY	Gosh, where are my manners? Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is Emmet. We used to date a million zillion years ago. It meant nothing to me. You have heard of Vitruvius, of course.
NECKBEARD	You're the teacher that made the Black Falcon who he is, then?
VITRUVIUS	That was a long time ago.
NECKBEARD	Farrr be it for a pirate to judge a man with an unsavory reputation.
EMMET	That's surprisingly gracious--
NECKBEARD	Stay away from me lady.
EMMET	Alright. Sure.
NECKBEARD	Say that to my face.
EMMET	Alright. Sure.
NECKBEARD	I was once the most feared MasterBuilder in all the lands. I lost the rest of me body fighting off a hundred of the Black Falcon's men. You cross me, and I'll make it an even fight, if you follow.
EMMET	Thank you for your clarity.
LUCY	He has an incredible mind.
NECKBEARD	Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew. This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard and Nobeard, and me First Mate, Chewbacca. You can call him Allbeard.
NECKBEARD	The route be stuffed to the gills with Empura shipping activity. It's heavily patrolled. We'll have to be keeping an eye open, and when the time be right, make ourrrr move.
EMMET	What's our move?
NECKBEARD	I'm sorry, did the Captain say you could finish swabbing the deck?
VITRUVIUS	Lucy. Welcome.
EMMET	It's Emmet.
VITRUVIUS	Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?
EMMET	Yes. What are you doing?
VITRUVIUS	Making.
EMMET	What's it for?
VITRUVIUS	What is anything for? It's what we were all meant to do. What the Maker has fated us to do.
EMMET	Okay, here's what I don't get. If our lives really are predetermined by some all-controlling dude, what is the point of doing anything?
EMMET	OW! Why did you do that?!
VITRUVIUS	The Maker fated me to.
EMMET	Or you did it yourself because you're a crazy person.
VITRUVIUS	Ah. Now, you're learning.
EMMET	I could just never make something like that. How did you even get the idea?
VITRUVIUS	I didn't. I just opened a window for it to fly through.
VITRUVIUS	Birds are, incidentally, one of the most creative of all the animals. They build nests. Create elaborate courtship rituals, make gifts for one another. And of course, their beautiful songs.
EMMET	Teach me.
VITRUVIUS	Open your throat and make a  sound.
EMMET	No. Teach me to do what you do.
VITRUVIUS	How can I teach you something you already know? It's already inside you. You've walled it up, but it still shines through. That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site? That was no accident.
EMMET	I'm not sure I follow...
VITRUVIUS	They say every night the Maker puts a blanket over the world, a blanket with tiny holes. Some call them stars, but I call them MakerPeepers.
EMMET	MakerPeepers?
VITRUVIUS	MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a time, before you were born, when making new things came as naturally to everyone as breathing. The world was messy and wild, and that made it beautiful. But then, everything became rigid and prefabricated, so everyone just stopped thinking of new things. Making has been outsourced to Empura. The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was.
VITRUVIUS	And yet, somehow, light still shines through the cracks.
EMMET	Oh no! Wait!	It got out...
VITRUVIUS	Isn't that marvelous? You have an idea, and then off it goes!
BAD COP	That's them. Man your weapons. Full steam ahead.
ROBOVIKING	We don't use steam. We row.
BAD COP	Fine. Full row ahead.
NECKBEARD	They're a-comin'! Dive!
EMMET	What are they doing?
VITRUVIUS	Collaborating.
LUCY	Vitruvius, follow my lead.
NECKBEARD	Mateys! Be me hands and legs! Start taking the ship apart!
EMMET	But we'll sink!
LUCY	That's the idea.
NECKBEARD	Put the four-piece over there. No! The skinny one. Come on!
EMMET	I don't get it-- What do I do?
LUCY	Build a hatch.
EMMET	Like for an attic?
LUCY	Like for a submarine.
LUCY	That's as far as you got?!
EMMET	Well...
NECKBEARD	Heading?
CHEWBACCA	Arrrrrrrr.
NECKBEARD	Get deeper. If we're too high their sensorrrs will detect us.
BAD COP	Nothing? But they were right here.
ROBOVIKING	Wait. There's something on the scanner.
NECKBEARD	Dive! Dive! Dive!
ROBOVIKING	Nothing. There's nothing.
BAD COP	Let me see that... DAMMIT!
ROBOVIKING	Hey, watch it man, I built that.
EMMET	Hey Lucy, you gotta see--
GROWN UP	Where are my dang keys? Finn, have you been playing in here?
KID	No.
GROWN UP	You sound like you are lying. Are you lying?
KID	No.
GROWN UP	Okay, this is my very special area, where I play with something
VERY NOT-ABLE-TO-BE-TOUCHED-BY-	anyone, because it is the most awesome thing I have ever made.
KID	Uncle Ted, why don't you have a girlfriend?
GROWN UP	Because you need money for girlfriends. Although they refuse to admit that. Although they admit it implicitly when they leave you for a banker.
KID	Why don't you have a job?
GROWN UP	Look, you can do anything you want with this big bin of parts, okay? Just promise me you aren't going to play in my special areas anymore.
KID	Okay.
GROWN UP	Is that a real okay or a fake one?
KID	Real.
GROWN UP	Okay. That's my man.
VITRUVIUS	Legotopia. The last free kingdom in the universe.
VITRUVIUS	Thank you.
EMMET	Does the Black Falcon know about this place?
VITRUVIUS	It's been hidden for ages by the fog and its remote location. Plus they have elaborate security measures.
DOOR FACE	Who goes there?
EMMET	Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man, a pirate head, and a loud dog. We're here to save the world.
DOOR FACE	Well, I've never heard of you, but come on in!
LUCY	That's the security?
KING KARL	Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!
EMMET	For Kreativity...
KING KARL	Exaktly!
EMMET	Why did you build all this stuff?
KING KARL	Well...Why not?
KING KARL	If you can conceive it, we will achieve it. Build anything whenever you feel it.
EMMET	You know we really don't have time--
KING KARL	Invent a game, like Roller Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting Tennis tickets...
KING KARL	Just wide!
NECKBEARD	This is me favorite sport.
KING KARL	We only teach art and music in school so kids feel unencumbered. No spelling, reading, science or math, we just make up all the numbers!
KING KARL	Make any idea thought or spoken. Rules were meant to be broken!
EMMET	No, rules were meant to be followed.
CHORUS	We have everything and nothing and something's all we've got. Why, you ask? What you should ask is... Why not?!!!!
EMMET	You guys are really weird.
KING KARL	Cool, man, thank you.
EMMET	This is crazy. You can't have a society without rules. I mean, your castle doesn't look very structurally sound at all!
KING KARL	Who is this guy?
LUCY	Emmet. He doesn't get out much.
VITRUVIUS	Emmet, these people are not MasterBuilders. They do not create with purpose, they create just to create. But they can also be very inspiring, because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to break the rules of what is possible.
EMMET	I wish that made sense to me.
VITRUVIUS	It will if you let it. (turning to Karl) King Karl, I wish we came to you with better news.
KING KARL	As do I. The others arrived just before you, which gave us a chance to rehearse the song. Follow me.
NECKBEARD	Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!
KING KARL	Meet your team.
BATMAN	Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email. On my Batphone. Which I invented. Gets emails. On a phone.
EMMET	Hello.
DUPLO	DUPLO!
LUCY	And where do you come from?
DUPLO	DUPLO!
LUCY	Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?
KING KARL	No. But he wants to help.
DUPLO	DUPLO HELP!
BATMAN	I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?
LUCY	No thank you.
BENNY	I'm also a MasterBuilder.
EMMET	Cool!
BENNY	I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where are you from? I'm from space. There's not a lot of oxygen up there. One time I was fixing my ship in space and there was a crack in my helmet. They say I should've died or gotten Space Madness but I didn't die. I'm here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it doesn't fly for some reason.
EMMET	Um, maybe if it didn't have two fronts and no back, and it didn't have five wings.
BENNY	I love wings. Wings are great, right?
NECKBEARD	He seems a little distracted.
BENNY	What? Where?
LUCY	Is this everyone?
BENNY	Oh, no. There's one more. My co- pilot Moppy. He's really organized.
BENNY	Hi Moppy.	Hi everybody. Did you meet my friend Benny? He's the best.	That's too nice of you, Mopper.	He can really help you with your quest.	Well, I don't know.	He gets real lonely sometimes.	Moppy!	It's true. He was all alone in space. He tried to look for his space friends but couldn't find them. No one is left but me. Him.
EMMET	What did you say you do again?
BENNY	Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First Class.
EMMET	Ah.
VITRUVIUS	We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders. Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's not a MasterBuilder, he's just the son of one. And Lucy, who is still an intern.
BATMAN	Hello.
VITRUVIUS	Along with a blind man, a pirate head, a crazy spaceman, and Batman...
VITRUVIUS	Together, we form a fellowship of the MasterPiece. A shining beacon of possibility, and the only thing that can counteract the power of the Kragle. If we can get this into the hands of the Chosen One--
BAD COP	Or didn't you know that as a former student of MasterBuilder academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd on your mass email?
KING KARL	I'm sorry, I had to let them in.
LUCY	King Karl! You betrayed us! You betrayed everything you stand for!
KING KARL	Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia had run up like a bunch of debt. Something about lots of spending and no revenue. Empura promised to fund the whole place. Honestly, I'm super sorry.
EMMET	This guy is supposed to be inspiring? More like conspiring... with a bunch of mean jerks who have my mom! You're just as bad as them, you big mean jerk!
KING KARL	Come on. Guys.
KING KARL	Where are you taking them? Not to the dungeon, right? You said--
BAD COP	Do I look like a medieval constable? No, they're going someplace much worse. Take them to... the conference room!
BAD COP	Okay we're good to teleconference.
ABOUT
BAD COP	Just, point the camera at you.
BAD COP	No, the other way. There. That's close enough.
BAD COP	Sir.
VITRUVIUS	Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the Maker!
LUCY	No no he's just on teleconference.
VITRUVIUS	What?
LUCY	It's like a phone. A telegram. He's not actually in the room.
VITRUVIUS	Like a crystal ball?
LUCY	Sure.
DORIS	Emmet!
EMMET	Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you down. Any more than I already have!
EMMET	Mom! No!
BLACK FALCON	These are all the lands I control! They are perfect! And they are going to be that way forever! Now that you can't mess any of them up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
LUCY	So wait. What was the purpose of this call then?
EMMET	You're a MasterBuilder, too?
KING KARL	I dabble. You were right. I'd rather be poor and free than comfortable and stuck.
BAD COP	Back up! Repeat. I need back up.
KING KARL	Bring it on.
KING KARL	Prepare for battle!
KING KARL	On my mark.
BAD COP	(into C.B.) Charge.
KING KARL	Charge!
KING KARL	Retreat!
KING KARL	You have to go.
EMMET	We can't leave you here.
KING KARL	It's my place to be here. Go!
BENNY	Everyone get in my spaceship!
EMMET	Over there!
LUCY	We have to go now!
DUPLO	DUPLO HELP!
EMMET	I built that chair! Check it out. That's my chair. Pretty good.
LUCY	That's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter.
EMMET	Well, it was my idea to get in the catapult.
LUCY	A credit hog. Great.
BATMAN	Where'd this thing come from?
R2D2
< WHISTLES >
EMMET	No idea.
NECKBEARD	Bogey on our six!
BENNY	Hey look at that over there--
LUCY	Benny! Focus!
NECKBEARD	There!
EMMET	My chair!!!!
BATMAN	I say we camp here for the night in this creepy Old West Ghost Town.
LUCY	What's up?
EMMET	Can't sleep. Kind of still upset about everything, you know?
LUCY	Upset about what?
EMMET	Well, I got in a fight with my mom that caused her to get kidnapped and the whole world is about to get frozen, if you must know, unless you were asking that sarcastically, which I now realize you were.
LUCY	Sorry.
LUCY	We'll find her.
EMMET	I hope so.
LUCY	I know it. I know you.
EMMET	I thought you said I didn't have a creative bone in my body.
LUCY	You don't.
EMMET	That's nice, thank you.
LUCY	I'm just trying to help.
EMMET	You know what you are, Lucy?
LUCY	What?
EMMET	A real pain in the elbow.
EMMET	What?
LUCY	You may not have a creative bone in your body, but you have a lot of really really earnest bones. You always did.
EMMET	Thank you?
LUCY	I mean, that day when we were kids, and you drew the face in art class, you inspired me. I thought maybe there was more out there in the world, and maybe you felt the same. That's why I asked you out. But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart, you know? That I was going one way and you didn't go with me.
EMMET	Think of how I felt. My mom trained me to follow the herd. To lay low. All I ever wanted was to fit in, to have friends. And the funny thing is, maybe I was trying too hard, but, my whole life, I never did have any real friends.
LUCY	We're being so dramatic. It was eighth grade!
EMMET	That's the most dramatic time in anyone's life, right? It's what made The Black Falcon such a world class dingaling.
LUCY	It made a lot of us dingalings.
EMMET	Yeah.
LUCY	You know, whenever I doubt myself, I look into this prism I found long ago...
EMMET	It's... beautiful.
LUCY	I know. It's a relic of the Maker. When I'm feeling low, I look at it, and it always makes me feel like there still is beauty in the world, and we all have a purpose. You know what I mean?
EMMET	Yeah. I do.
LUCY	Well, good night.
EMMET	Yeah. Okay.
TED	Finn? What did you do to the spaceship? It's in pieces! I told you not to play with this and you broke it! It took me years to build all this!	74.
TED	And what's it doing in the Old West Town? And is that Batman? It doesn't belong here!
FINN	I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just wanted to play.
TED	Well, life isn't all play. Sometimes it's serious and it gets screwed up and you don't feel like playing. You just wish for once everything was in the right place.
FINN	Okay.
VITRUVIUS	I don't suppose this is the restroom?
EMMET	No. Definitely not. (then, stopping him) Hey, Can I ask you something? I keep having these strange dreams about a squishy bumpy giant--
VITRUVIUS	Visions of the Maker. Quite unusual.
EMMET	What does it mean? Do I have a fate?
VITRUVIUS	We all have a fate. But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker, and taking that fate into our own hands. I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean.
EMMET	Why do you always talk in weird riddles? I just want answers.
VITRUVIUS	Then why don't you try building something for yourself?
EMMET	I'm sorry, that's lame.
MECHA-BIRD	That's lame. That's lame.
VITRUVIUS	Not bad. You're learning now.
EMMET	No I'm not. I'm just copying what you did.
VITRUVIUS	A dilettante borrows. A true artist steals.
EMMET	That makes no sense!
VITRUVIUS	And all this does?
LUCY	How the heck are we going to do this?
EMMET	It's okay. I have a plan.
LUCY	Really?
EMMET	This R2 unit had the plans for Empura Tower stored in its memory bank.
LUCY	That's convenient.
EMMET	Looking over it last night, I noticed the tower follows the same construction principles as the condos I was building back in Legopolis.
EMMET	Wait.
LUCY	What about this?
LUCY	Darn.
VITRUVIUS	How about this?
VITRUVIUS	What, is it because I'm blind?
BATMAN	Check this out:	78.
THEN--
NECKBEARD	AHOY!
LUCY	Stop it! Everyone!
VITRUVIUS	Creativity in groups is hard.
LUCY	We don't have time for that.
EMMET	Or we can just wing it.
SERVICE NINJA	Well, I don't know, I've lived alone a long time, and sharing space with you is a new thing for me...no it's not like that...	Hey, we didn't order any--
LUCY	(man voice, into phone) I love you please move in with me.
EMMET	The Black Falcon's office!
BATMAN	My office is bigger.
LUCY	Emmet.
NECKBEARD	Arr, his appointment book be saying he be scheduled for a massage at four.
BATMAN	He'll get a flipping massage alright.
DAD	Language! There are kids here.
BATMAN	Who are these nerds?
SON	We, uh, can't move.
LUCY	They won't budge.
DAUGHTER	The bad guy is going to freeze everyone.
MOM	Kids? Are you okay?
DAD	They're alright, baby.
SON	I miss you, mom.
EMMET	Me too.	This is really sad. How can you keep living like this?
DAD	Well, yeah, we can't be together. We can't touch or see each other. But in here-- and if I could, I'd be pointing to my head-- I'm not stuck. In my brain we're sharing a delicious meal together.
MOM	Thank you sweetie.
DAUGHTER	Pass the mustard.
LUCY	That's pretty elaborate.
DAD	They can freeze you. They can tell you what to do. But they can't stop our secret weapon. Ideas.	Now go give `em hell.
EMMET	Wait. Batman, give me your Batperiscope.
EMMET	Now at least you can see each other.
NINJA	You have grown a beard.
NINJA	It's very nice.
NINJA	Is there something in your throat, sir?
NINJA	Very much.
NINJA	At your service, commander.
NINJA	Sir?
NINJA	Yes, sir.
NINJA	Yes, sir-- ow!
ROBOSKELETON	Black Falcon? You're supposed to be at your massage.
EMMET	Mom...
DORIS	What? Emmet?
EMMET	It's me, Mom. I've here to save you, so you can save the world.
VITRUVIUS	Rodrigo Falcone. My old student. It's time you went back to SCHOOL!	RUN!
BLACK FALCON	The old dog still has a few tricks. But I guess your friends didn't tell you that I was flanked by like a hundred soldiers. Now!
BLACK FALCON	Get the rest of them!
LUCY	Why won't anything in this hallway break off?!
BATMAN	It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!
NECKBEARD	Lucy.
LUCY	Yes?
NECKBEARD	I want you to know, I love you.
LUCY	Me too...
NECKBEARD	And even if the world be ending, and we all get frozen, I'd feel better about the whole situation if I could get frozen with you as my bride.
LUCY	Are you really doing this?
NECKBEARD	Lucy. Will you take me hand in marriage? Metaphorically.
LUCY	Um...
NECKBEARD	Lucy!
EMMET	Mom! Hurry!
EMMET	No!
DORIS	No!
BATMAN	We can't win this. We've got to hide and make a new plan.
NECKBEARD	(knows he's right) Arrr!
BAD COP	Take these perps to the Black Falcon's office. The rest of you, follow me. Looks like we'll be playing a little game of hide and seek.	Did you really think you were going to come up here and save the day? You're a follower, my friend. You don't have the stuff.	And you. You must be real proud of this one, huh? He's a credit to the family. Just like his talentless father.
EMMET	Mom, I'm so sorry.
DORIS	I know sweetie.
EMMET	Just- tell me everything's going to be okay.
DORIS	I wish I could, son.
EMMET	Mom... Why didn't you -- why didn't you teach me what you knew?
DORIS	I wanted you to be safe. I thought you would be happier. When I saw you with that funny drawing, it was so marvelous. And then I thought of what your life would be, how everyone would treat you. I just couldn't let that happen.
EMMET	I know you're the Chosen One, but-- I just wish you had let me choose for myself.
DORIS	I...I don't know what to say.
EMMET	They got promoted...
EMMET	But you didn't do anything.	Look down there.
BATMAN	That does not look good.
NECKBEARD	When do we get to the part about coming up with a plan?
BENNY	I've got a plan.
NECKBEARD	Uh-oh.
NECKBEARD	What about Lucy and the others?
BENNY	We'll come back for them. After we stop that Kragle.
BENNY	Can we go in the blue one?
BAD COP	There they are!
NECKBEARD	What does it matter?
BENNY	I fly better in blue.
BAD COP	No! Re-open the door! Everyone in ships! Go!
ROBONINJA	Dude, you don't have to yell.
HOBBIT	Every time!--
BLACK FALCON	Bahahahahahahaha!!
DORIS	It's too horrible to bear.
VITRUVIUS	What is? Describe it to me. I feel really really left out!
EMMET	The world is ending.
BATMAN	Go down to the city! What are you doing?
BENNY	Calling for help from my space friends!
NECKBEARD	What, a bunch of mops? There be no space friends! Just go!
BENNY	Alright, you don't have to be mean about it.
LARRY	< SIGH > Of course.
LARRY	I think a big dinobot is freezing everything with mucusy sneezes.
LARRY	I don't know. Complain?
LARRY	I mean, it's not like we can do anything.
MECHABIRD	...We can do anything! ...We can do anything!
LARRY	Wait a minute...
LARRY	I don't know exactly. I'm just going with it.	No offense.	Who the heck did that?
LUCY	That guy?!
BLACK FALCON	Do I smell something burning? It smells like a tire fire in here.
LUCY	Excuse me.
EMMET	Ow!
EMMET	Mom. Go. Do whatever you're supposed to do!
DORIS	I... don't know what to do. So tired...
LUCY	She's too weak. You have to do it.
EMMET	Do what? What can I do?
LUCY	I believe in you, Emmet. I was mad because you disappointed me for a while, but since it wasn't your fault, I'm willing to give you a mulligan on it.
EMMET	A what?
LUCY	A mulligan. It's from golf.
EMMET	You play golf?
LUCY	The point is, you've spent your whole life wanting to fit in and have friends, by pretending to be something you're not. But now that you've let the real you shine through, you've made some friends who like you for who you are. And even if they're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a blind man and an intern--
EMMET	You like me?
LUCY	I do.
EMMET	Neckbeard likes me?
LUCY	...Sure.
EMMET	But... I'm not the Chosen One.
LUCY	You wanted to make your own choices, right? So choose yourself.
EMMET	Nuh uh.
EMMET	This.
DORIS	What is it, Emmet?
EMMET	I don't know. It just came to me.
VITRUVIUS	You have channeled the Maker and chosen your fate. You have chosen to be the Chosen One.
BLACK FALCON	Whoa. That was weird.
LARRY	What the heck is that?!
BENNY	Wow, that thing is really big.
NECKBEARD	Uh, Benny...
LUCY	What do we do?
DORIS	Go after him.
LARRY	Quick, everyone! Run behind it! Get away from the mist!
DOCTOR	It's a b--
EMMET	So...not square.
EMMET	The Maker. It's all real...
EMMET TED
EMMET TED
TED	What the heck are you?!
EMMET	What the heck are you?!
TED	I'm a person.
EMMET	I'm a person. You on the other hand are a giant squishy beast.
TED	You're a talking toy. This is considerably less cute than I have been led to believe.
EMMET	So ugly...
EMMET	What are these?!
EMMET	AHHHHHH!!!
TED	Calm down! Where did you come from?
EMMET	Did you build that?
TED	Yeah, but it's seriously messed up.
EMMET	Are you the Maker?
TED	The what?	FINN!!!
FINN	What?
TED	Are you seeing this?
FINN	Yeah.
EMMET	Two Makers?
TED	How did this-- what is-- my sets,
THEY'RE ALL--
FINN	The guys. They needed my help.
TED	Against what?
FINN	Against the Kragle.
TED	The what?
EMMET	The Kragle. The thing that is freezing everything together.
TED	Oh. Krazy Glue?
EMMET	Good Lord.
TED	What? I'm using this to glue my set together. So it won't get messed up by the kid.
EMMET	But then-- it can never change.
TED	Exactly. It's the only thing in my life that's perfect.	102.
TED	I can't find a job that doesn't make me hate myself. My girlfriend dumped me for a rich trustafarian... dingaling, is what he is, and I'm watching my sister's kid while she has a fun time partying in the Hamptons with her annoying brood of hot girlfriends who won't have a thing to do with me, and the only thing I have in my life that makes any sense, that I have any control over is that perfect world right there.
EMMET	But... nothing is perfect unless it can change. You can make something, you know, and it can be great, for a while, but then... then someone maybe adds to it, makes something new out of it. And that keeps happening until it becomes something that a single person could never envision. Truth is, creating alone is never as good as creating with others.
TED	See. No. That's not true- because with others, they don't see things the same way, so--
EMMET	I know. You want to control everything. I get it. But if you succeed, in the end, all you'll ever have is what you've got.
TED	What else could I have?
EMMET	Who knows? That's the best part.
TED	Use this.
EMMET	What is it?
TED	What is it? It's the ca--
FINN	Cone of Power. It's called the Cone of Power.
TED	Okay. The Cone of Power.
FINN	Put it on the Kragle to stop it.
TED	Yeah. Try that.
EMMET	Thank you. It was nice to meet you both, disgusting squishy giant Maker creature and smaller, messier giant Maker creature.
FINN	Nice to meet you.
EMMET	I should go save the world now.
TED	Let's play.
BENNY	Hello!
EMMET	Thanks for dropping in.
BATMAN	I hope we're not imposing.
BATMAN	There's too many of them!
NECKBEARD	They're coming at us from all sides!
BENNY	Guy! Look up! My space friends! They got my message!
HAN SOLO	Anything for you, Benny!
INDY	Hey, you look familiar.
NECKBEARD	Lucy!
LUCY	Neckbeard! We need to talk...
LARRY	I could build such a better ship than that.
DORIS	Emmet!
LUCY	Doris, are you okay back there?
LUCY	Doris?! Why did she do that?
VITRUVIUS	The connection between a mother and son is a powerful thing.
LUCY	But it's certain death.
VITRUVIUS	On the contrary. It's connections like those that give the best chance to survive...
DORIS	Get your hands off my flipping son.
EMMET	Mom... Wow. Just... wow.
DORIS	I'm the Chosen One, remember?
EMMET	I guess that makes two of us.
DORIS	I was wrong, Emmet. (BAM!) All this time I was trying to keep you from getting hurt, so I told you not to make waves. (POW!) I'm just so glad that I get to see the beautiful waves you finally get to make.(SOCKO!)
EMMET	(WHAM!) I love you, Mom. (CRACK!)
EMMET	Lucy? How did you do that?
LUCY	I used a few connections.
DORIS	Emmet, now's your chance!
EMMET	You're right. I don't belong here...
EMMET	I belong here!
EMMET	Rest in pieces.
< EXPLOSION NOISES >	109.
DOCTOR	--oy!
FATHER	Thank God!
LUCY	What the heck just happened?
EMMET	Something totally foofy.
NECKBEARD	Ahoy there.
