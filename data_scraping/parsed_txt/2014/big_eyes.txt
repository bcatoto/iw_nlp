Big Eyes

JANE	Good luck.
BOSS	We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working?
MARGARET	(quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated.
BOSS	"Separated"?
MARGARET	Sir, I realize I have no employment experience... but I sure need this job. I have a daughter to support. I'm not very good at tooting my own horn... but I love to paint, and if I could just show you my portfolio...
MARGARET	I studied at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville, then took Illustration classes in New York. Here's a pastel I did... here's some fashion design... a portrait in charcoal... though I enjoy mixing mediums, preferably oil and ink...
BOSS	You do understand this is a furniture company?
DEE-ANN	Sugar, you made it! You're in North Beach!
MARGARET	Deirdre, look at you!
DEE-ANN	"Dee-Ann."
MARGARET	"Dee-Ann"?!
DEE-ANN	Yeah, I know. But I hit this scene... and "Deirdre" just sounded like something my mother would call me.
DEE-ANN	So are you flipping for all this?! Are you settled? How's Jane?
MARGARET	Jane -- is swell. She's started in a sweet little school. Though... it's hard without her father. I'm not sure we can do this...
DEE-ANN	Oh stop that. You're better off. Between us, I never liked Frank.
MARGARET	You were a bridesmaid!
DEE-ANN	Exactly. That's why I couldn't speak up. But if I ever see you wrong off again, I will tell you. Now come on. Let's have some fun.
DEE-ANN	Toss off your middle-class preconceptions! This is Pompeii! We're livin' in the volcano!! For jazz, check up the hungry i. For Italian, Vanessi's. For salvation, try the Buddhist temple. For art, the Six Gallery --
MARGARET	Do they only show Modern?
DEE-ANN	Everyone only shows Modern! In the basement, they've got espresso.
MARGARET	What's espresso? Is that like reefer?
DEE-ANN	You've got a lot to learn!
TOURIST GUY	Your stuff is cute. How much?
MARGARET	Today's a special: Two dollars.
TOURIST GUY	I'll give you one.
MAN'S VOICE	Monet? "Monet"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro.
MAN'S VOICE	C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow!
WALTER	You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! I poured myself into that painting. It's thirty-five dollars.
WALTER	Excuse me, Ladies.
MARGARET	All finished.
WALTER	You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap.
MARGARET	I'm just glad they liked it.
WALTER	Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work...
WALTER	What's your name?
MARGARET	M-Margaret...
MARGARET	Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there?
WALTER	Mm, no. I like you, Margaret...
WALTER	"...Ulbrich." You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. Lemme show you how it's done.
WALTER	Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul!
JANE	Nah.
WALTER	"Nah"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting??
JANE	But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy.
WALTER	Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye.
MARGARET	Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...!
WALTER	Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien?
MAITRE'D	Je vais bien, merci! Comment allez- vous?
WALTER	Je vais bien! I'm with a beautiful woman! Could life be any grander??
WALTER	And I don't even have to pay! I'm set because I gave the chef a painting. You know what he said? "Nobody paints Montmartre like Walter Keane!"
MARGARET	I can't believe you lived in Paris.
WALTER	Best time of my life...
MARGARET	I've never even been on an airplane.
WALTER	Well you have to experience these things! Grab 'em!! I wanted to be an artist, so I just went! Studied painting at the Beaux- Arts. Lived in a Left Bank studio. I survived on bread and wine...
MARGARET	You're a romantic.
WALTER	Damn right!
WALTER	Of course, walkin' away from the bourgeois scene wasn't a snap. I had to quit my job. Leave my wife. These choices aren't easy...
MARGARET	I've never acted freely. I was the daughter. The wife. The mother... All my paintings are of Jane, because she's all I know.
WALTER	You shouldn't knock your work. I'd give an eyetooth to have your talent.
WALTER	You can look into someone and capture them on canvas! You paint people! (he gestures sadly) I can only paint -- things. My street scenes are charming... but at the end of the day, it's just a collection of sidewalks and buildings.
MARGARET	Walter, I'd bet you could paint anything.
WALTER	Whew... Baby, when you look at me like that, I could fall hard.
MARGARET	This is moving fast. You're my first date in a long time...
MARGARET	Sweetie, could you stop fidgeting?
JANE	Mother, after all this time, you MUST know what my face looks like.
JANE	Hey! Your canvas is blank!
WALTER	Er, you can't rush inspiration --
MARGARET	Jane! Don't bother Mr. Keane. You know creativity has to well up from the inside...
WALTER	Don't worry. She's not bothering me...!
WALTER	There's something I gotta ask you. What's with the big crazy eyes...?
MARGARET	I believe things can be seen in eyes. They're the windows of the soul --
WALTER	Yeah, but, c'mon! You draw 'em like pancakes! I mean, they're WAY out of proportion!
MARGARET	Eyes are how I express my emotions. That's how I've always drawn them. When I was little, I had surgery that left me deaf for a period. I couldn't hear, so I found myself staring... Relying on people's eyes...
VOICE	Walter? Hey -- Walt!
FRIENDLY GUY	I thought that was you!
WALTER	Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don.
FRIENDLY GUY	Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail.
WALTER	Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday.
FRIENDLY GUY	Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects!
MARGARET	What was that??
WALTER	I -- I didn't want you to know...
WALTER	I'm in commercial real estate.
MARGARET	You're a -- Realtor?
WALTER	YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running!
MARGARET	And you're... ashamed?
WALTER	Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur.
JANE	A-hem!
WALTER	What's wrong...?
MARGARET	Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother...
WALTER	You're a perfect mother.
MARGARET	He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman...
WALTER	Marry me.
MARGARET	Walter! I --
WALTER	(he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense!
WALTER	But just think of the fun we'll have..! And I'll take care of you girls.
WALTER	Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend.
MARGARET	"Hawaii"? M-marriage? Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. Why would we go to Hawaii?!
WALTER	Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise.
MARGARET	You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors.
WALTER	I knew you'd love it.
MARGARET	Oh, can't we stay here forever??
WALTER	Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week.
MARGARET	This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle --
DEE-ANN	This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married.
MARGARET	I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it.
DEE-ANN	Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit.
MARGARET	You're talking about my husband!
DEE-ANN	I know! That's why I brought it up.
MARGARET	I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. I'm a divorcee with a child. Walter is a blessing.
MARGARET	"You are on the threshold of untold success."
RUBEN	What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention.
FANCY LADY	It's quite gestural.
RUBEN	Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes.
FANCY LADY	I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one.
RUBEN	Well... I'm not allowed to say...
RUBEN	Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here...
WALTER	Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute?
RUBEN	Walter. In polite society, the word is "appointment."
FANCY LADY	(glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later...
WALTER	You're gonna love my stuff today.
RUBEN	Haven't I seen that one before?
WALTER	Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement!
RUBEN	I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings?
WALTER	It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental
FLOURISH)	And here.
RUBEN	Well, it's not going up here. Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal.
WALTER	Hey, Art isn't fashion!
RUBEN	Yes it IS! People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes.
WALTER	Would they want... this?
RUBEN	Good God! You've entered a new period.
WALTER	No... they're my wife's.
RUBEN	Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans.
WALTER	It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it.
RUBEN	Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other.
WALTER	So... what do you say?
RUBEN	I say, NO! It's not art.
WALTER	Not -- "art"??
RUBEN	It's like the back of a magazine! "Draw the turtle! Send in a nickel and win the Big Contest!"
WALTER	How dare you! Lots of people would like this.
RUBEN	Well, nobody who's walking through the door of this gallery! Now please! Clear out this clutter, before the taste police arrives.
WALTER	We'll never break in...! Because there's a CABAL. A secret society of gallery owners and critics, who get together for Sunday brunch in Sausalito, deciding what's "cool." They're like Freemasons. No, worse! McCarthy, in his hearings: "That painter, I anoint. That painter, I banish to nowheresville!"
MARGARET	I think people buy art because it touches them --
WALTER	Heh! You're livin' in fairy land! People don't get to discover a thing. They buy art, because it's in the right place at the right time.
BANDUCCI	Give it up for Cal Tjader! That set was HUMMIN'! Al-aright, be sure to stick around for the one a.m. show!
WALTER	Hey, Banducci. I love the music tonight. It's a gas.
BANDUCCI	Oh. Thanks, thanks.
WALTER	I'm Walter Keane. I'm a painter. I was looking at your walls, and they're pretty plain.
BANDUCCI	Really? Hm...! Maybe you're right. What color were you thinking?
WALTER	No -- I'm an artist. I used to be based on the Left Bank. But now I've relocated to the "States," and I'm looking for an... exhibition venue.
BANDUCCI	I like my club the way it is. Your stuff's so hot, go put it in a museum.
WALTER	Okay! I respect that. You're a businessman, not a charity! So how 'bout if I, uh... rented your walls?
WALTER	Yes! The paintings are available for public viewing daily, from 7 to 3! (an awkward beat) Er, no. 3 a.m. It's in a nightclub. (he hangs up) Maggie! It's promotion time! We gotta lay the racket!
WALTER	Ah, beautiful! An art lover! Yes sir, how may I help you?
MAN	I'm, uh, just looking for the john.
TIPSY LADY	Look at that child. She's so sad.
TIPSY MAN	Is she poor..?
TIPSY LADY	She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you "Keane"?
WALTER	Yeah.
TIPSY LADY	Well you're a hell of a painter.
WALTER	Why, thank you...! Thank you so much!
TIPSY LADY	Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes.
TIPSY LADY	Is something wrong?
WALTER	Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif.
TIPSY MAN	(beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece...
BANDUCCI	Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh?
WALTER	You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in.
BANDUCCI	Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves.
WALTER	"Location, location, location..."
WALTER	It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT!
BANDUCCI	Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. We got ladies present --!
MARGARET	I've never posted bail before.
WALTER	I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him.
MARGARET	Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism.
WALTER	You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye.
MARGARET	I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?!
WALTER	It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale.
MARGARET	Don't ever do it again.
WALTER	Don't give me a hard time. I'm just grabbing my stuff...
BANDUCCI	Can you believe this? We're sold out, and I don't even have a headliner!! Hell, it's a Monday!
BANDUCCI	Dope, we made the front page!! People are here, cause they wanna see the sappy paintings that made grown men fight!!
WALTER	I'll see you in COURT, you son of a bitch! I'm suing you for assault! Slander! False arrest!!
DICK	Yes sir! Whew. That was quite a load of horseshit you gents were layin' out there. Dick Nolan. The Examiner.
DICK	Hey pal, don't lose any sleep. I eat this stuff with a spoon! It gives me something to type about, in my column.
WALTER	(he laughs, relieved) I thought you only did celebrities.
DICK	Well, Banducci's famous -- and you hit him! So you're a celebrity, once- removed. Buy me a drink?
WALTER	Huh? Uh, sure --
DICK	Gary! I'll have a Ward Eight, in a frosted high boy. My friend'll have the same. (he beams, then turns) So! Walter, tell me about your work --
WALTER	Well, when I was in Paris...
DICK	Jesus, not those! I mean the little hobo kids.
WALTER	What do you wanna know...?!
WALTER	Ding-a-ling! Wake up, we're a HIT!
WALTER	What a night! I sold out all your Big Eyes!!
MARGARET	There must be two-hundred dollars...
WALTER	They adore you! Cause of that article, the joint was PACKED. And then, a famous journalist showed up, and -- I need more paintings! Now!
MARGARET	Walter, they take at least a week. There's layering, shading --
WALTER	Of course! But, this is opportunity! Ah, we're gonna make a crackerjack team: Me schmoozing up the club, while you're back here, doing what you love!
MARGARET	Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane?
WALTER	...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul.
GROUPIE	They hold so much feeling.
WALTER	You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. I've always done it that way.
WALTER	If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out.
MARGARET	Walter...?
WALTER	Baby! Hey, uh, what are you doing here? I
UM --
MARGARET	Why are you lying?
MARGARET	You're taking credit for something that isn't yours.
WALTER	I was... trying to close the deal --
MARGARET	Those children are part of my being!
WALTER	I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter --
MARGARET	They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!!
WALTER	Shh, QUIET!
WALTER	Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?!
MARGARET	You take this so lightly --
WALTER	Not all all! But it's not about ego! You wanna say you did the street scenes? Fine! I don't care! Say a monkey painted it!
MARGARET	I'm glad you can dash off your pieces without any emotional connection...!
WALTER	Ah, honey! I just wanna share them with the world! Would you rather have your children piled in a closet... or hanging in someone's living room?
WALTER	Hey. Who is that remarkably handsome and confident man?
BANDUCCI	That's Dino Olivetti -- as in Olivetti typewriters.
BANDUCCI	Don't even try, Walter. He doesn't speak a lick of English.
EUROPEAN BLONDE	Mr. Olivetti is enchanted with the painting. He would like to know... who is the artist?
WALTER	I am!
WALTER	It's a delight to meet you, Signore! Buon giorno! Have you been an art lover for long..?
WALTER'S VOICE	I call that piece "The Waif." Isn't it striking? With its juxtaposition of girl, cat, and stairs... and its almost Flemish use of underpigment...
WALTER'S VOICE	Baby! Baby! Can you believe it?!!
WALTER	We made five grand!! Five THOUSAND dollars...!!! And that wasn't even one of your good ones!
MARGARET	Don't you mean... one of your good ones?
WALTER	No. No no! One of -- OUR good ones. (the spirit of generosity, he hands her a CHECK) Look at those zeroes! We've hit the big time! We are now hanging in the collection of Italian industrialist Dino Olivetti! With his patronage comes credibility! And with credibility comes RESPECT!
MARGARET	What about... honesty?
WALTER	Aw c'mon! The paintings say "Keane"! I'm Keane, you're Keane. From now on, we are one and the same.
WALTER	On behalf of the children of the world, we present this painting to Mayor Christopher!
WALTER	In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia!
DICK	The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation.
WALTER	Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, "The Lion and the Child"!
WALTER	Joan said "Marvelous"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening.
MARGARET	But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries.
WALTER	Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism!
WALTER	He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful...
WALTER	Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this!
JANE	I remember when Momma painted that.
MARGARET	Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago.
JANE	Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen --
WALTER	No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. I painted that one --
JANE	No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress.
MARGARET	L-lots of girls have that dress...
WALTER	You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in.
JANE	Well you did a really good job.
MARGARET	Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... I was raised Methodist. If it's a problem, I can go --
PRIEST'S VOICE	No, no! Please. We don't chase people away. What is troubling you?
MARGARET	I lied to my child.
PRIEST'S VOICE	Why would you do that?
MARGARET	My husband... he pressured me into doing it. I've never lied to her before. I'm not that kind of person.
PRIEST'S VOICE	Is your husband that kind of person?
MARGARET	Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. He takes care of us. He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house...
PRIEST'S VOICE	But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her?
MARGARET	"Harm"?? Oh! Not at all. I'm just looking for answers...
PRIEST'S VOICE	Well, the modern world is a complicated place.
MARGARET	N-no. That's not what --
PRIEST'S VOICE	It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. Perhaps you should trust his judgment.
HIPSTER LADY	I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish.
HIPSTER MAN	Exactly. I love it.
TIPSY MAN	We got in early. We own three. Thanks, doll.
DEE-ANN	Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff?
MARGARET	Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show --
DEE-ANN	Oh "we" did?? And why would "we" do that??
MARGARET	Well... he's more established.
DEE-ANN	Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass?
DEE-ANN	It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type...
MARGARET	Thanks for coming.
WALTER	Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss)
WALTER	Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible!
TIPSY MAN	Your husband's quite a talent. Do you paint, too?
MARGARET	I don't... know.
NOSY GUY	I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute?
WALTER	That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils.
NOSY GUY	"Oils"? But isn't that acrylic...?
WALTER	Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain!
NOSY GUY	So where do you get your ideas?
WALTER	What do you mean?
NOSY GUY	I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children?
WALTER	Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter...
WALTER	I remember when she was a baby...
WALTER	Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities!
JANE	Mom! I wanna come in.
JANE	(she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked?
WALTER	Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle?
WALTER	Whew! Out of this world...!
MARGARET	I dunno. I'm not really comfortable with this. Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now...
WALTER	Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund.
MARGARET	Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day.
WALTER	Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break!
WALTER	Is that a tear...? You've gone deep!
MARGARET	Do you -- like it?
WALTER	I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights?
MARGARET	No. The secret is the shadow. I shadowed the eyelid.
WALTER	I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength.
MARGARET	Is that your best version of sincerity?
WALTER	I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art.
MARGARET	You're going to be on television?!
WALTER	Yes! But... what will I say?? Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings??
MARGARET	Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls.
WALTER	Cute.
MARGARET	I guess you've painted yourself into a corner.
WALTER	Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out!
MARGARET	Walter... art is personal.
WALTER	What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?!
WALTER	I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. I grew up in an orphanage? I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape!
MARGARET	What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those?
WALTER	Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it!
MARGARET	(calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors?
WALTER	Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere...
WALTER	I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying...
WALTER	Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today?
BLONDE CLERK	"Sales?" None with this crowd.
BLONDE CLERK	These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters!
WALTER'S VOICE	And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE!
WALTER	Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window.
MARGARET	What time is it?
WALTER	I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner?
WALTER	When's the last time you washed your hair?
MARGARET	I've been... busy.
WALTER	(he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? Lemme see.
MARGARET	No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world.
WALTER	"The world"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit
MALEVOLENT)	I'm your number one fan.
MARGARET	No, please! Walter, it's -- personal.
WALTER	But we're husband and wife. We shouldn't have secrets...
WALTER	It's a completely different style.
MARGARET	Yes it is.
WALTER	It looks like you.
MARGARET	It's a self-portrait.
WALTER	How am I gonna explain that?
MARGARET	I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself.
WALTER	That seems a bit confusing. "Keane" means me.
MARGARET	Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine.
WALTER	Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes?
MARGARET	Nobody!
WALTER	Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?!
MARGARET	No! NOBODY saw it!
WALTER	You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD!
MARGARET	I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! Janie used to have a mother who painted. Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings!
WALTER	Janie thinks I'm in here, painting.
MARGARET	C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side --
WALTER	That was the honeymoon period!
WALTER	Jesus, you're so fragile.
MARGARET	I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this!
DICK	So you're now called "The Painting Keanes"?
WALTER	Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities!
DICK	I had no idea Margaret painted.
WALTER	Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art.
MARGARET	What about Georgia O'Keefe?
WALTER	The bar's over there.
WALTER	Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! Behind every great man is a great woman.
DICK	True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas?
MARGARET	(a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line.
DICK	ModiWHAT? The Italian joint?
WALTER	Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there!
WALTER	What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good.
JANE	Who's that?
WALTER	Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes!
WALTER	Lily, honey, how are you?!
LILY	I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth.
WALTER	Really? Did you get in a fight?
LILY	No. It fell out!
WALTER	Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it?
LILY	She handled it.
WALTER	Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun!
DICK	Walter... you never told me you had another daughter.
WALTER	Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage.
MARGARET	Walter? Walter! We need to speak.
MARGARET	What is going on here??!
WALTER	That's Lily. I'm sure I mentioned her --
MARGARET	No you didn't.
MARGARET	Did she just move in??
WALTER	No! Her mom's just going to Vegas for the weekend. I'm supposed to have her once a month, but I don't make her mom enforce it.
MARGARET	How can you keep something so big a secret???
WALTER	She's a sweet girl.
MARGARET	I'm sure she is.
WALTER	I put up with your daughter. I never said a peep.
MARGARET	I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
WALTER	I'm sorry. Sorry! Please... let's just try to get through this.
LILY	Dad told me you had a bunk bed.
JANE	Take the bed. I can sleep on the
FLOOR --
LILY	No, that's not fair! The floor's fine for me.
JANE	Do you live far away?
LILY	I guess... about a twenty minute drive.
JANE	"Twenty minutes"?! That's close!
JANE	But you never see Walter?
LILY	No, I see him all the time! He comes up and visits every week.
LILY	Doesn't he talk about me?
JANE	Huh? Uh... sure. I guess a little.
JANE	Does he talk about me?
LILY	Uh... yeah. Sometimes.
JANE	So what's your mom like?
LILY	She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot.
JANE	Yeah, mine's the same. Except she drives a Packard.
JANE	I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it?
WALTER	Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat...
MARGARET	I painted it!
RICH MAN	Really? It's very evocative. ...Sensual...
RICH MAN	"MDH"? You're so... mysterioso.
MARGARET	Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. "MDH" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number.
RICH MAN	Er... seven?
MARGARET	Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! "M" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, "D" is 4, "H" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven!
WALTER	Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price!
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money?
SNOBBY ARTIST #2	Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings.
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes.
SNOBBY ARTIST #2	It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity.
SNOBBY ARTIST #1	The customers won't notice...
RUBEN	Christ. It's a movement.
MARGARET	Rembrandt, shush!
DEE-ANN	My God! I thought I misread the address.
MARGARET	Yeah. That driveway is long. (she giggles, embarrassed) Honestly, I can't believe I live here.
DEE-ANN	Whoa.
MARGARET	I know! Two acres, a pool, five
BEDROOMS --	Though I thought that was excessive, since there's only three of us here.
DEE-ANN	Three? I thought there were four.
MARGARET	What? Oh -- you mean Lily! No, she doesn't really live with us. That was just in the articles.
DEE-ANN	Crazy. A fake daughter...
DEE-ANN	It's been so long since I've seen you.
MARGARET	I know. North Beach is 30 miles, but it might as well be 300...
DEE-ANN	You're probably busy, hanging out with your new rich buddies. "Kim Novak."
MARGARET	Oh, please! She's Walter's friend. (a quiet shrug) He brings people by... the Beach Boys were here. But, it's pretty isolated.
MARGARET	Jane has nice friends. Sometimes I pick them up at the junior high, and we all get pizza. But she's busy... Are you hungry?
DEE-ANN	I'm thirsty.
MARGARET	Good! I'll whip us up two gin fizzes.
MARGARET	When we moved in, I thought a wet bar was extravagant... but it's surprising how much use you can get out of it.
DEE-ANN	How's Walter?
MARGARET	He couldn't be happier. He has everything he ever dreamed of.
DEE-ANN	And so do you! Fabulous.
DEE-ANN	Oh, is that your studio?
MARGARET	No --! You can't go in --
DEE-ANN	I just want a peek. See what the workspace of a wildly successful artist looks like --
MARGARET	Dee-Ann, please! STOP --
MARGARET	W-Walter paints in here too.
DEE-ANN	Is Walter home??
WALTER	What the hell's going on here?!!
MARGARET	Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she...
WALTER	You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done!
WALTER	There!
WALTER	You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!!
DEE-ANN	SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter!
WALTER	Get outta my house! My big house! Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf!
DEE-ANN	Fuck you!
WALTER	I don't want her ever invited here again.
MARGARET	I won't.
JANE	Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball!
MARGARET	Okay, honey. I have to go work.
JANE	Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask.
MARGARET	Where did you appear from? Didn't you hear? No visitors!
MARGARET	Is this what it's come to? You're the only living soul I can tell my secret? (she lowers her voice) Well -- I painted them all! (she shudders with release) It's TRUE! I did every single one --
MARGARET	Well, every one except that street scene. But I did the rest. Every Big Eye! And nobody will ever know. But YOU.
MARGARET	No you don't! It's nice to have company, but that sofa is new. (she pushes him off) Let's find you some carpet to lay on.
MARGARET	I think there's a scrap back here...
MARGARET	Well what's this?
WALTER	M-Maggie! What're you doin' up?
WALTER	I had a helluva night. Worked three or four clubs. (he winks, loosey-goosey) Stumbled onto some hot gossip: Madame Chiang Kai-shek is coming to town! Straight from Taipei! I think we should present her with a painting -- get Dick to flack it... Or the heck with Dick. I met a new guy at UPI...
MARGARET	Maybe you should give her one of your street scenes.
WALTER	You think? I dunno -- I thought you could whip off a doodle of Chinatown. With a cute little kid, sort of a big- eyed slanty-eyed thing...
MARGARET	No, Walter. She's a dignitary. Doesn't she deserve a piece that comes straight from you? From your experience???
WALTER	Yeah? Maybe you're right. She probably doesn't have a Parisian street scene hanging in her palace.
MARGARET	Unless Madame Chiang Kai-shek already has a Cenic.
WALTER	"Cenic"...? Uh, what's that?
MARGARET	Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings.
WALTER	Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me "Scenic"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard "e," I became "Cenic."
MARGARET	The more you lie, the smaller you seem.
WALTER	(unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics!
MARGARET	Then why do you paint over the name?
MARGARET	A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off.
WALTER	You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!!
MARGARET	No, I haven't. I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there.
WALTER	I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters...
MARGARET	Walter?
MARGARET	Have you even been to Paris?
WALTER	I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good.
MARGARET	I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. There's three extra bedrooms. Go pick one.
WALTER	What are you working on?
MARGARET	A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, "Escape."
WALTER	I figured out a solution to our problems.
MARGARET	What?
WALTER	Teach me. Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore.
MARGARET	And then -- YOU'LL paint them?
WALTER	Sure! Why not?
MARGARET	Walter, this isn't paint-by-numbers! You think it's easy?! It took me years to learn --
WALTER	Y-you're right! But you know me! I'm a quick study. And I've got the basics...
MARGARET	If you knew the basics, you wouldn't be at the easel. You have to sketch it first!
WALTER	So...? What's first?
MARGARET	I dunno. You tell me. You're the creator.
WALTER	It's a -- Keane.
MARGARET	Oh, a Keane! How witty. You know, when we met all those years ago, I never would've imagined in my wildest dreams that one day --
WALTER	YEAH YEAH! Point taken. I'm standing here naked and humiliated in front of you. Look... can we just do a crying child?
MARGARET	How old is the subject?
WALTER	Huh? C'mon, it's a head --
MARGARET	It matters! A young child's head is round. An older child's head is oval!
WALTER	The child is this old! You're trying to make this difficult --
MARGARET	NO I'M NOT! Every line is a decision! It's easy to talk about art, but it's not easy to MAKE art!!
WALTER	How's SALES?
REDHEAD CLERK	Oh, you know. Mondays --
WALTER	How many posters are back here?
REDHEAD CLERK	Exactly? I dunno, 3,000 or --
WALTER	Does the printer owe us more? Do we owe him??
REDHEAD CLERK	Uh, let me --
WALTER	What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse?
REDHEAD CLERK	Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a --
WALTER	For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for?
WALTER	Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife?
WALTER	Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up??
REDHEAD CLERK	Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane?
WALTER	What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...?
REDHEAD CLERK	I -- I don't understand. You'll always be famous. You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir.
WALTER	It's not even mine! It's one of hers.
MAITRE'D	Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor!
WALTER	This doesn't change anything.
MARGARET	(trying to hold her ground) I know the truth.
WALTER	Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's.
MARGARET	NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs!
WALTER	Quiet! Lower your voice --
MARGARET	Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT --
WALTER	NO YOU WON'T! Or -- I'll have you whacked!
MARGARET	What??!
WALTER	If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler?
MARGARET	You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- Do you know what it's been like for me? I don't have any friends. I've lied to my own child...
WALTER	Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. It's life imitating art! A crying Keane!
MARGARET	What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date...
WALTER	Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. Right now there's a shot... God, I'm shaking I'm so excited. The New York World's Fair. 70 million visitors. Opening day, I unveil my MASTERPIECE!
MARGARET	What masterpiece?
WALTER	Exactly! What have I been missing all this time?! Da Vinci has his Mona Lisa... Renoir has his Boatmen's Lunch... but where's my defining statement?
MARGARET	You sound insane. Artists don't announce a masterpiece --
WALTER	Why not?! Didn't Michelangelo know he was hittin' a homer, when he was on his back painting the Sistine Chapel?
MARGARET	He worked on that for FOUR YEARS!
WALTER	Posterity, baby...!!
WALTER	And here's the best part. It's for Unicef! Unicef is sponsoring the Hall of Education. Aw, we can finally give back to the children of the world!!
MARGARET	It's too big. Why'd you promise them Cinerama size?
WALTER	Because it has to encompass all children. All races! One hundred stricken faces! Marching to infinity! The ultimate Walter Keane! At least that's what I told Life Magazine.
WALTER	Oh, a publisher says it's good timing to put out a coffee table book. You know, classy: "Tomorrow's Masters." So they need my... uh, early portfolio. My artistic evolution...
MARGARET	You're right! Where are your preliminary sketches?? All that time in art school, and somehow we waylaid your youthful experiments! The half- finished charcoals, the struggles...
WALTER	(a bit off-balance) I know you're being sarcastic, but these are all good ideas. Berlin war orphans... early self-portraits...
MARGARET	Get out of here. I'm trying to work.
JANE	Mom, what's for dinner? Mom! Are you home...?
MARGARET	W-what are you doing in here --? This is -- Walter's studio! You have to leave!
JANE	Mom... I know.
MARGARET	Jane, you don't know anything!!
JANE	I'm not a child anymore.
CANADAY	Four... five... SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...!
CANADAY	"Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --" Oh this is ABSURD!
CANADAY	And WHO was on the selection committee?
CIVIC LEADER	Oh! Well there wasn't a "committee," per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. Mr. Keane just contacted us directly!
WALTER	Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong.
MARGARET	I was happier selling paintings in the park.
WALTER	You are one crazy bitch.
WALTER	So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale!
MARGARET	Friday, I file for divorce.
WALTER	Aw, why are you always so miserable? Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon!
WALTER	Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree.
SOCIETY MAN	Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times?
WALTER	Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely --
SOCIETY MAN	I think you should read the Times.
"GROTESQUE" "APPALLING"
"TASTELESS"	"Lowest common denominator"
MARGARET	How could anyone... say something so cruel?
WALTER	(a seething fury) What do YOU care?! That's MY name being dragged through the mud!
WALTER	Is he here?
SOCIETY MAN	Er... yes. Which is perhaps why it would be best for everybody if you --
WALTER
CANADAY	Mr. Keane, this is not the venue. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to the editor.
WALTER	What are you afraid of?? Just because people like my work, that means it's automatically bad??
CANADAY	No. But that doesn't make it art either.
CANADAY	Art should elevate -- not pander! Particularly in a Hall of Education!
WALTER	You have no idea!
WALTER	Why does a man become a critic --?? Because he can't create! You don't --
CANADAY	Ugh! That moldy chestnut --
WALTER	Don't interrupt! You don't know what it's like! To put your emotions out there, naked, for the world to see.
CANADAY	What emotions?! It's synthetic hack work! (he loses it) Your "masterpiece" has an infinity of Keanes -- which just makes it an infinity of kitsch!
WALTER	What's wrong with lowest common denominators?! That's what this country was built on!!
WALTER	I'm gonna sue EVERYBODY! I'll sue that pansy critic! And the World's Fair! And -- Unicef! Yeah! I'll take down Unicef, and all their precious little boxes of dimes!
WALTER	But I can't sue you, can I? (in Margaret's face) You were the ultimate betrayal! You FAILED me with that painting!
WALTER	You crossed over from sentimentality to KITSCH!
JANE	Ow!
MARGARET
WALTER	You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??!
MARGARET	Walter!
WALTER
WALTER	Lemme in, you BITCHES!!
WALTER	Ow!
JANE	Mom, what are we gonna do??!
WALTER	You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up!
WALTER	You're gonna blow like an atom bomb!
MARGARET	We're leaving.
MARGARET	I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago...
JANE	But where are we going? We don't even have any clothes!
MARGARET	Where we're going, we won't need much. Hawaii.
JANE	Really...?
MARGARET	Yes, Hawaii. Because it's paradise. There's flowers, and birds, and beautiful colors. And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves.
MARGARET	Hello?
INTERCUT:
WALTER	Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today.
MARGARET	It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it.
WALTER	Aren't you acting too rash?
MARGARET	Walter, our marriage is over.
WALTER	Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose. But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
MARGARET	Walter, I want a divorce.
WALTER	Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words.
WALTER	I sure hate that it's come to this. Well... I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced.
MARGARET	If that's the price.
WALTER	Really?!
WALTER	Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream.
MARGARET	My God, Walter! How much more money do you need?
WALTER	It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand? You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes!
MARGARET	Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office.
JANE	No, I'm gonna surf with the gang.
MARGARET	Your friends are a bit... wild.
JANE	Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. Maybe you need to make some.
MARGARET	Y-you know I can't have people over to the house.
JANE	That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!!
ASIAN LADY #1	Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief.
ASIAN LADY #2	We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind.
MARGARET	I'm not interested.
ASIAN LADY #1	Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general?
MARGARET	I'm not interested in whatever you're selling.
ASIAN LADY #2	But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news.
MARGARET	From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly.
ASIAN LADY #2	Yes! Exactly! That is the good news!
ASIAN LADY #1	Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand.
ASIAN LADY #2	Do you know what it says in Timothy
MARGARET	Sounds like my ex-husband.
MARGARET	Would you like to come in?
MARGARET	It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers.
ASIAN LADY #1	It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted.
MARGARET	So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses?
MARGARET	I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws...
ASIAN LADY #2	Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one.
MARGARET	And how do you know...?
ASIAN LADY #2	Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth.
MARGARET	What does that mean, exactly?
ASIAN LADY #2	Honesty leads to self-respect. A feeling of well-being.
MARGARET	It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things.
JANE	I just can't believe you let people in the house.
MARGARET	I have nothing to hide! It also says no lies. "Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more."
HIPPIE CHICK	Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol!
WALTER	Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! "The Factory"? I had a factory before he had a soup can!
WALTER	Ah! It's my art supplies.
WALTER
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES	"Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!"
MARGARET	No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false.
MARGARET	One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter.
MARGARET	No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. I'm the only painter in the family.
CANADAY	You have got to be kidding!
DEE-ANN	I knew it!!!
RUBEN	Who would WANT credit?!
WALTER	Holy mother of GOD!
WALTER	Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down.
DICK	I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory.
WALTER	But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee!
WALTER	Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a
MAGICIAN)	See?! Berlin orphans, 1946!
DICK	But... how could she...
WALTER	Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!!
DICK	I-I, but... why would Maggie do this?
WALTER	She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: Jehovah's Witnesses.
DICK	I really don't know much about them...
WALTER	Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom!
MARGARET	He made me sound crazy!!
ASIAN LADY #2	Just rise above it.
MARGARET	But how can I?! He claims I copied HIM! That he taught ME how to paint! (reading the NEWSPAPER) "She used a slide projector to trace my work and fill in the colors."
ASIAN LADY #1	And which part of that is untrue?
MARGARET	When I finally told the truth, I felt good about myself for the first time in years!! I'm not going to let him take that away.
JANE	Hey. Is Jehovah okay with suing??
REPORTER #1	Seventeen million dollars! The art world is abuzz! Is it possible that the decade's top-selling painter can't even paint??!
REPORTER #2	Or is Mrs. Keane simply a bitter ex- wife, trying to steal her husband's fame and fortune? Today in Federal Court, lawyers present their opening arguments in the case of Margaret Keane vs. Walter Keane and Gannett Newspapers. A trial that could produce the largest libel and slander award in Hawaiian history.
REPORTER #1	Mr. Keane! Are you at all concerned about the charges?
WALTER	I'm angry as hell! But I'm lucky to have the mighty Gannett News Company watching my back. I expect to have this whole trial dismissed by noon. Truthfully, my only concern is that somebody get this woman some psychiatric care. She needs it!
GANNETT LAWYER	Margaret Keane is a public figure. And as such, she has to prove that our newspapers published statements, aware of probable falsity. But there is no evidence that our editors could have known that the assertions were untrue. We would like to submit 692 articles and interviews in which Mrs. Keane credits Mr. Keane as the painter of the so-called "big eye" children.
JUDGE	How many years back do these go?
GANNETT LAWYER	Mrs. Keane has been making these statements since 1958.
JUDGE	This is a very strange case. These paintings hang in museums all over the world, attributed to Mr. Keane. And regardless of the truth, Mrs. Keane has contributed immeasurably to the confusion...
JUDGE	It seems impossible that Gannett's actions would ever meet the legal standard for libel. So -- the charge against them is dismissed.
GANNETT LAWYER	Thank you, Your Honor!
GANNETT LAWYER	Good luck, Keane.
WALTER	"Good luck"? W-where the hell are you going?!
GANNETT LAWYER	We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. Just dance your way out of it.
JUDGE	Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order?
WALTER	I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! Let's PROCEED!
WALTER	I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world --
JUDGE	Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time.
WALTER	Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. It's hard to keep this all straight...
WALTER	Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story --
JUDGE
WALTER	Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme?
MARGARET	I was forced into it. You had --
MARGARET	He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad...
WALTER	(like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath.
WALTER	S-sorry.
MARGARET	I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. Maybe he was right... You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion.
WALTER	Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant.
MARGARET	That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde.
WALTER	What an outrageous statement! I demand we strike that from the record!
JUDGE	(he SLAMS his fist) Overruled!!
MARGARET	(she loses her temper) No! You're outrageous! Constantly criticizing! Wearing me down! Saying I'd be "knocked off" if I ever told the truth!!
WALTER	Your HONOR! I ask for a mistrial!
JUDGE	HEY! This is not a domestic squabble! Or -- maybe it is. But the rest of us have no interest in watching you two go at it.
WALTER	I'm sorry for the emotions. I'm an artist.
JUDGE	Maybe.
WALTER	I call as my witness... Mr. Walter Stanley Keane!
BAILIFF	Do you swear to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
WALTER
WALTER	Mr. Keane. There has been a lot of innuendo and contradictory testimony about the genesis of the "big-eyed waifs." Would you mind clarifying to this court, once and for all, who spawned these paintings?
WALTER	Why -- I created the children.
JUDGE	The choreography is not necessary. Just sit down and testify.
WALTER	I've had a wonderful life. I've been an artist, a world traveler, a friend of untold celebrities... (he gets misty-eyed) But when I look back at it all, when I peer into my heart and define what mattered...
WALTER	it is that I was dedicated to the hungry children of the world. It all began in Berlin. After World War II...
WALTER	...the orphans were clutching the barbed wire. Their bodies lacerated, their fingers scrawny, their eyes big and helpless. Imploring me, begging me... "Do something!" "Do something."
WALTER	...and then Miss Joan Crawford walked up to me...
WALTER	...Kim Novak...
WALTER	...Liberace...
WALTER	...Wayne Newton...
WALTER	Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, "That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life."
WALTER	I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile
INDUSTRY --
JUDGE	You're done.
WALTER	B-but, I'm not finished --
JUDGE	Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word.
WALTER	So... mistrial?
JUDGE	NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint.
BAILIFF	Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front...
JUDGE	Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough?
JUDGE	Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours.
JUDGE	Mr. Keane?
WALTER	I'm... setting the mood. Getting the... muse to strike...
JUDGE	Well, your muse has 58 minutes.
WALTER
JUDGE	Mr. Keane! Are you all right?
WALTER	No -- it's -- Ah shoot! My old shoulder injury just flared up. I've got a bad muscle -- I've been taking medication for the inflammation...
WALTER	I -- I don't think I'll be able to paint today.
MARGARET	Thank you! Thank you so much.
REPORTER #2	What are you going to call the painting?
MARGARET	"Exhibit 224."
REPORTER #1	The jury found in favor of Margaret Keane on all points. She won on charges of defamation, emotional distress, damaged reputation --
WALTER	What a group of idiots... a quagmire of incompetence... This doesn't change a thing!
REPORTER #2	Margaret! Do you feel vindicated by the high award?
MARGARET	Oh... it was never about the money. And honestly -- I doubt Walter will even pay.
MARGARET	I just wanted credit for what I had done. The justice is... I got my art back. My prayers have been answered.
PORTLY LADY	Margaret! Could I possibly have your autograph?
