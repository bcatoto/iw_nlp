Mud

ELLIS	I'm comin' out now. He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot of his bed. He's out in one motion.
MARY LEE	I just want to have a conversation. I just want to talk about it. Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him.
NECKBONE	What the shit man?
ELLIS	Suck it. Drive. The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail.
NECKBONE	How old is she?
ELLIS	A Junior.
NECKBONE	She's got nice titties. You talk to her?
ELLIS	Nah.
NECKBONE	You're gonna have to talk to her.
ELLIS	I know.
NECKBONE	Remind me when we get back to my house, Galen's got a book on that. Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat, launches them out into the water.
NECKBONE	Shit. Ellis raises up behind him. He takes a deep breath, nods.
NECKBONE	Your dad'd kill us he knew we went out there.
ELLIS	I'm not worried about my dad killin' us. THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER sprawls out in front of them. It's enormous. Their boat drifts at the mouth of the Arkansas, a small river by comparison. The Mississippi is a swirling mess of brown water and yellow foam six football fields wide.
NECKBONE	What if it sinks?
ELLIS	It ain't gonna sink. We gotta move if we're gonna make it back. Set your watch. We'll need a good fifteen minutes. Neckbone sets an alarm on his fat plastic wristwatch. They take their seats. Ellis cranks the motor. The small boat slowly chugs out onto the massive river.
NECKBONE
NECKBONE	Galen thinks it's been here awhile. Thinks the last flood did it. Ellis follows as Neckbone winds through the trees. They stop at a deep creek that cuts across the island. Neckbone looks to his right, then his left. Sees what he's looking for.
NECKBONE	It's down there. A fallen tree trunk that straddles the creek. Ellis starts across.
NECKBONE	Hold it. Neckbone picks a large stone up off the ground.
NECKBONE	Look. Eight feet below the tree trunk, a nest of water moccasins curl around in the creek. Neckbone drops the stone on top of them. The snakes fan out.
NECKBONE	Little shits. Their mud-caked high-tops stomp across the trunk.
NECKBONE	So there it is.
ELLIS	Yeah, there it is. A 26 Foot Long BOAT sits nestled in the tree limbs above.
ELLIS	It came down from up there. Ellis points to higher limbs that have long been broken off. Neckbone walks to the back of the boat and hangs his head over. He finds a gaping hole of gutted wood.
NECKBONE	Motor broke off. Ellis isn't concerned with the motor. His eyes are locked on a covered cabin at the front of the boat.
ELLIS	Who else knows about this?
NECKBONE	Just me and Galen.
ELLIS	What's he think?
NECKBONE	He don't care about it.
ELLIS	Good. Ellis walks to the cabin. He pushes a vinyl door open.
ELLIS	'Cause this boat's ours. Ellis has to duck down to go inside. Neckbone follows.
NECKBONE	It's got its own shitbox Neckbone slides back a portion of floral curtain and light streams in. He starts opening small closets and drawers. Ellis plops down on the rotted bench cushions.
ELLIS	This is perfect.
NECKBONE	Ho-Lee-Shit. Neckbone stares in an open drawer. He removes a stack of Playboys from the 1980's. Ellis smiles at him. He leans back and props his foot against the sink cabinet across from him. This is home. Neckbone opens the first Playboy. It disintegrates.
NECKBONE	Aw shit.
NECKBONE	Her tits are so small.
ELLIS	Neck.
NECKBONE	Look at that beave. You gotta see this.
ELLIS	Neck.
NECKBONE	What?
ELLIS	Someone's here.
NECKBONE	What?
ELLIS	Someone's livin' here.
NECKBONE	Shit.
ELLIS	We gotta go. I can't be late.
NECKBONE	What are you doing? Ellis stares at a muddy boot print, cross in the heel, stamped in the center of their boat. He looks back to the treeline, then down the shore. He looks to his feet. The boys' shoe prints make chaotic patterns in the mud. Larger boot prints lead off down the shoreline.
NECKBONE	What is it?
ELLIS
	I saw that same boot print up in the tree. It has a cross in the heel. Somebody's been in our boat.
NECKBONE	Shit. Let's go. Ellis begins following the boot prints around the shoreline.
NECKBONE	We gotta go if you wanna make it back.
	Your dad's gonna kick our ass. It'll take twice as long goin' up river.
ELLIS	Hold it.
ELLIS	Up there. They stop.
NECKBONE	Where the hell'd he go?
ELLIS	I don't know.
NECKBONE	Shit. You know that guy?
ELLIS	I've never seen him before.
NECKBONE	Shit.
NECKBONE	Shit.
MUD	What you say?
MUD	Helluva thing.
ELLIS	What's that?
MUD	Boat in the trees. It's a helluva thing.
ELLIS	You talkin' 'bout our boat?
MUD	I'm talkin' about my boat.
NECKBONE	We found it.
MUD	You found it with me livin' in it. Possession is nine tenths of the law.
NECKBONE	So?
MUD	Don't tell me you boys are from Mississippi?
ELLIS	No.
ELLIS	You got crosses in your heels.
MUD	Nails. Shaped liked crosses.
ELLIS	What for?
MUD	Ward off evil spirits. A man I called an Indian but was Meskin said they were Seven-league boots worn by the seventh son of a seventh son. Told me it'd turn me into a werewolf but that's a lie. I don't know nothin' about that.
MUD	They just good luck, but so far they ain't been workin' too well. (missing tooth smile) What's your name?
NECKBONE	I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis, and mister you may be stone ass crazy but I know you're not the owner of that boat, not for nine tenths of nothin'.
MUD	Neckbone? That's a real handle son. Where ya'll from?
NECKBONE	What do you care where we're from?
ELLIS	DeWitt.
MUD	Arkansas boys. Ya'll had me worried for a second.
ELLIS	We s'posed to know you?
MUD	I doubt it. I grew up `round here, but I've been gone awhile.
ELLIS	Where around here?
MUD	Different places. Spent a lot of time back up near the White.
ELLIS	You know Shelly's Oxbow?
NECKBONE	Ellis. We gotta go.
MUD	I know it. Guy named Tom Blankenship used to live back in there.
ELLIS	He still does. His boat's cross from mine.
MUD	Ain't that somethin'.
MUD	I like you two. You remind me of me. And seeing how you boys are from Arkansas and we know some people and sounds like we all from the same place I'd say we can make a deal here about somethin'.
ELLIS	A deal for what?
MUD	Food. Food for a boat.
NECKBONE	This guy's a bum Ellis. Come on.
ELLIS	Why don't you go get your own food?
MUD	I would if I could, but I told somebody I'd meet `em here. So I'm stuck for now and what I got's runnin' low. Neckbone walks back and pulls Ellis by the arm.
NECKBONE	He's a bum Ellis, let's go. Mud lays a serious look down on Neckbone.
MUD	I'm no bum. I got money. You can call me a hobo `cause a hobo'll work for his living and you can call me homeless `cause that's true for now, but if you call me a bum again I'll have to teach you somethin' about respect that your daddy never did. Neckbone's confidence recedes. Ellis stands his ground.
ELLIS	When they show up, you'll leave? Mud begins fishing again.
MUD	Yeah.
ELLIS	And when you leave, that boat's ours?
MUD	Yeah. Ellis studies Mud's face, clothes, tattoos. He's thinking about it. Mud pauses from fishing to make eye contact.
MUD	I'm in a tight spot. I just need a little help.
ELLIS	We gotta go. With that, Ellis turns to leave. The boys walk briskly back to their boat. Ellis looks over his shoulder to see Mud making another cast with his fishing pole.
ELLIS	You get his name?!
NECKBONE	No! Ellis looks back. Mud has disappeared.
ELLIS	I'm sorry.
SENIOR	Where you been?
ELLIS	Neck and I got caught up helpin' Galen.
SENIOR	You're s'posed to be helpin' me. I had to load this myself.
ELLIS	I know, I'm sorry.
SENIOR	Just get in the back. Can't be later than we are.
ELLIS	Yessir. Senior flips up the tailgate. Ellis hops up the wheel well and into the bed of the truck. He steadies himself on one of the coolers as his father pulls away.
SENIOR	Let's go son. Ellis crumples the wrapper to his finished hotdog and jumps down from the bed of the truck.
ELLIS	It's s'posed to be ten.
SENIOR	It's ten you do your share. I loaded this mornin'. That makes it five. Ellis begrudgingly stuffs the five in his jeans.
ELLIS	You drop me at Neck's? Senior checks his pants pockets, feels around under his seat.
SENIOR	Hadn't you seen enougha him today?
ELLIS	Said he had something for me.
SENIOR	You see anymore Ding Dongs over there? Ellis checks under his seat and pulls out a half-empty box of Ding Dongs. Hands one over to his father who rips the package with his teeth.
ELLIS	What'd Momma wanna talk to you about?
SENIOR	What?
ELLIS	This mornin', what'd she wanna talk with you about?
SENIOR	You spy on me in my own house?
ELLIS	I wasn't spyin', just heard ya'll.
SENIOR	That's your mother's business. Senior makes this his answer, eats the Ding Dong.
ELLIS	I came by for that book.
NECKBONE	What book?
ELLIS	You said Galen had a book might help me out.
NECKBONE	Aw, yeah. We gotta give it a minute. You hear that music?
ELLIS	Yeah.
NECKBONE	That means he's doin' it. That's his doin' it song.
ELLIS	You know who it is?
NECKBONE	Whoever's drivin' that white Dodge.
ELLIS	You tell Galen 'bout this morning?
NECKBONE	Nah. You tell anybody?
ELLIS	No.
NECKBONE	That guy was crazy.
ELLIS	Maybe. I don't know. I think he just needed some help.
NECKBONE	Well he can swim his ass off that island and get some.
ELLIS	I think I'm gonna go back, take him some food.
NECKBONE	Why?
GIRL	You're Neckbone right?
NECKBONE	Yeah.
GIRL	You look like a good enough kid. A word of advice, don't grow up to be like your shit heel uncle.
GIRL	Hey!
GIRL	You hear me? You treat a woman like a princess. Got it?!
NECKBONE	Yeah.
GALEN	Come on baby.
GIRL
GALEN	That's uncalled for.
GALEN
	A lot of people are comfortable with that kind of thing in the bedroom. Some people aren't. We know that about you now... Ellis sees one of the misshapen pearls at his feet. He picks it up and holds it to the sun.
NECKBONE	Pearls. Galen finds 'em in some of the mussel shells. Most of 'em ain't worth dick, but he likes to make necklaces for the girls. Come on, let's get that book. Neckbone walks into the trailer. Ellis stands up and retrieves the other two pearls out of the dirt. He crams them in his pocket and follows Neckbone inside.
NECKBONE	I don't want you goin' back out there by yourself. That river's scary enough with two people, and I don't trust that guy.
	Here it is. He takes out a hardback book. The slip reads, "The Confident Confidant, communicating with the opposite sex."
NECKBONE	Galen said this really turned things around for him.
ELLIS	Thanks. Ellis flips delicately through the manual.
NECKBONE	You really going back out there?
ELLIS	I think it's the right thing to do.
NECKBONE	Well...I'll be over in the mornin' then. Galen, his thumbs tucked under his armpits, walks back to the trailer. He passes the boys and notices the self-help book in Ellis' hands.
GALEN
	That's a good book. Be sure you do the worksheets in the back. Let's get some dinner Neck. Galen's gone inside.
NECKBONE	I'll call 'fore I come.
ELLIS	All right. Neckbone follows his uncle into the trailer. Ellis flips through his new book as he heads out of the trailer park.
ELLIS	You okay momma?
MARY LEE	Yes.
ELLIS	I'm all right. Mary Lee shuts off the water and lets the dish rest in the sink. She turns to Ellis.
MARY LEE	I'm gonna turn in.
ELLIS	Okay momma. Mary Lee slips past him and enters her bedroom. The door closes and Ellis is left alone in the den. It's quiet. He waits, looking at the door his mother just closed. Ellis walks into the kitchen and eases open a cabinet door. Checking over his shoulder, he zips his backpack open and fills it with CANNED FOOD.
ELLIS	What do you know about Tom Blankenship?
SENIOR	What? Senior doesn't turn around from his work at the sink.
ELLIS	Mr. Blankenship, what do you know about him?
SENIOR	Why?
ELLIS	I don't know. He looks lonely over there.
SENIOR	Some people move to this river to work on it, and some move here to be left alone. Senior makes his way to the ice machine and begins scooping ice into a large white cooler. Mary Lee emerges from the houseboat dressed for work, a secretarial job. Senior stops what he's doing to watch her. She walks over to Ellis.
MARY LEE	Let's sit down for dinner tonight okay? Will you make it home by seven?
ELLIS	Yes ma'am. She walks off the boat without a glance in Senior's direction. He trails her with his eyes before going back to digging in the ice. loud BEEPS. Ellis crams it in his backpack and runs off the boat.
ELLIS	Bye Dad. Senior holds a hand up but never looks up from his work.
NECKBONE	Where you think he's at?
ELLIS	I guess we should try the boat. They head for the treeline.
ELLIS	Looks like he made camp.
NECKBONE	(looking up to the boat) You think he's up there?
ELLIS	What're you doin'? Mud bounds down, stepping from limb to trunk to the ground. It's an agile move.
MUD	I try to never sleep in the same place twice. What you got there? Mud motions with his head to the backpack in Ellis' hand. Ellis holds it out to him.
ELLIS	I brought you some food. Mud looks at the backpack, but doesn't move.
ELLIS	Go on.
MUD	I owe you boys.
MUD	I was gonna try runnin' a trot line today. See how far that'd get me.
MUD
	I'd been rationin' what I had...green bean never tasted so good.
MUD	I appreciate it.
ELLIS	Yeah.
NECKBONE	What you got that pistol for?
MUD	For protection.
MUD	Ya'll don't have to be afraid of me. I have two ways to protect myself out here. This shirt, and this pistol.

MUD	There are fierce powers at work in the world boys. Good, evil, poor luck, best luck. Men have to take advantage where they can. Mud removes a spool of fishing line and a small plastic tackle box. He scoops up the duffel bag and heads into the woods.
MUD	Ya'll comin'? trees.
ELLIS	Who's this guy you're waitin' on?
MUD	I'm not waitin' for a guy. I'm waitin' on my girlfriend. Juniper.
NECKBONE	Is she hot?
MUD	She's beautiful.
NECKBONE
	Bullshit.
MUD	Best lookin' girl I've ever seen. Hands down. Blonde hair. Long legs. She's like a dream you don't want to wake up from. She's got birds tattooed on her hands, here. Mud stops, points to the area on the top of his right hand, between his thumb and pointer finger.
MUD	Nightingales. Good luck birds.
NECKBONE	That a good luck snake?
MUD	No it is not.
NECKBONE	I hate snakes.
MUD	That's because God made them for us to fear.

MUD	It's a thing we knew to be afraid of before we even got into this world. the island. It looks different than the other shoreline. A large swath of red clay angles sharply into the water.
MUD	Cherokee would wrap snake skin around their pregnant women's bellies. Induce labor, scare the child out. Here. He fetches a length of rope out of the duffel bag and tosses it to Neckbone.
MUD	Set that `round your bed at night. Snake won't cross braided rope.
NECKBONE	Thanks. (nods to Mud's tattoo) So what's that for then? Mud walks to a tree branch that has grown out over the bank, nearly resting in the water. He sets a trot line from it.
MUD	A reminder. Don't get bit. I was 10, swimmin' `bout a mile up from here. Me and Juniper. Sonofabitch swam right up under me, bit me just below the armpit. June got me out, got me to a clinic. Doctor said I shoulda been dead in twenty minutes. Took us an hour just to get back to town.
NECKBONE	What'd they do?
MUD	Gave me antivenom. For a cotton mouth. See here. Mud shows the tattoo on top of his right hand. He points out the two cotton blossoms bulging from the snake's mouth.
MUD	Problem with antivenom is they can only give it to you once. It's made from horse blood. Your body would reject it a second time. The cure ends up being more dangerous than the poison.
ELLIS	What happens if you get bit again?
MUD	I die, or just sweat it out. Neckbone, not buying it, looks at Ellis and taps his watch.
ELLIS	We gotta go help Neck's uncle.
MUD	All right.
ELLIS	You never said your name.
MUD	Mud. You can call me Mud.
ELLIS	Mud?
MUD
NECKBONE	Here you go, Mud. I think you need that worse than I do.
MUD
	I'll be all right. The boys disappear back into the trees.
GALEN	They look bright enough. The owner of the shop, an ELECTRICIAN(62), holds up a metal bar with the lamps affixed by bolts at either end.
ELECTRICIAN	Should be. I rigged DC power up through marine batteries. Makes it portable. Gave you a rigging bar to set on your shoulder.
GALEN	So you really think these'll work under water?
ELECTRICIAN	In theory.
NECKBONE	You start datin' I bet her dad'll give you a free pick-up truck.
ELLIS	I don't care about that. Ellis watches as the same Skinny Kid from before tries to flirt with her. She's not having it. He pops her bra strap before landing the final straw, a smack on her ass. She turns and swats at him. Seeing this, Ellis is on his feet and crossing the street.
NECKBONE	What's goin' on? Ellis doesn't turn back. Neckbone reluctantly sets the carburetor down and follows.
MAY PEARL	Stop it! She shoves the Skinny Kid, but he continues laughing.
OLDER KID	Holy shit Pryor, get off your ass.
MAY PEARL	You didn't have to do that.
ELLIS	He was messin' with you.
MAY PEARL	Do I know you?
ELLIS	I'm Ellis. That's Neck.
ELLIS	We went to Junior High with you, before you went to High School.
MAY PEARL	How old are you?
ELLIS	Fourteen.
MAY PEARL	Fourteen? You know you just punched a Senior?
ELLIS	So?
MAY PEARL	You think you're pretty tough.
ELLIS	I know.
MAY PEARL	What else do you know?
ELLIS	Nothin'.
NECKBONE	Son of a bitch...Ellis?
ELLIS	What?
NECKBONE	Look.
NECKBONE	You ever seen that girl before?
ELLIS	No. Did you see her hands?
MAY PEARL	Hello?
ELLIS	Sorry. We know a guy we think might know that girl.
MAY PEARL	Oh.
GIRLFRIEND	May Pearl! Let's go!
MAY PEARL	Okay!
ELLIS	I guess I'll see you.
MAY PEARL
ELLIS	I can find it. May Pearl walks over to her friend. Ellis watches her go, but then remembers Juniper. He turns to Neckbone.
ELLIS	Where'd she go?
NECKBONE	Into the Piggly Wiggly. She came from the motel.
ELLIS	I'm gonna go see if it's her.
NECKBONE	I gotta go check on Galen. We'll pick you up out front. Ellis heads for the Piggly Wiggly. Neckbone calls after him.
NECKBONE	What'd she say?
ELLIS	Wants me to call her.
NECKBONE	Shit.
NECKBONE	Was it her?
ELLIS	It's her. I saw the tattoos. He wasn't lyin'.
NECKBONE
	No he wasn't.
ELLIS	What you hidin' for?
SENIOR	I ain't hidin'. He notices Senior tip back a pint of liquor and set it at his feet. Ellis opens the screen door leading inside.
SENIOR	Come over here. Ellis lets the door fall shut and skulks over to a beam that supports the carport. He leans into it.
SENIOR	You know I love you?
ELLIS	Yessir. I know.
SENIOR	I work you hard 'cause life is work. You know that?
ELLIS	Yessir.
SENIOR	Your Mamma's been talkin' 'bout movin' in town.
ELLIS	What's that mean?
SENIOR	She seems set on it. Wants to separate. She may ask me for a divorce.
ELLIS	What's that mean for me?
SENIOR	It means enjoy the river son. Enjoy it while you live on it, 'cause this way a life isn't long for this world. Game and fish's 'bout made certain of that.
ELLIS	But you and me can still live out here. Game and fish can't take your boat. Not while you're still in it.
SENIOR	The houseboat's in your mother's name. Her daddy give it to her not me. If she wants to leave it, Game and Fish has ever' right to take this boat apart board by board.
ELLIS	But that ain't right. You work outta here. We got the ice machine, the traps. What are we supposed to do?
SENIOR	Like I said, this is your mother's business.
ELLIS	I ain't no townie. I ain't livin' like that.
SENIOR	I've let you down. A man should be in charge of his own affairs, but I haven't worked it like that.
ELLIS	But ya'll are married. Ya'll are s'posed to love each other.
SENIOR	I don't know about that anymore.
SENIOR	Ellis? He stops and turns back to his father. Senior tries to express a sentiment he doesn't have the words for. Ellis continues inside.
MARY LEE	You're late. Ellis doesn't speak, he doesn't look at her. He enters his room and shuts the door. He's heard the news and she knows it. Mary Lee's face drops.
MUD	Ellis? Ellis, still frozen, slowly turns to him. Mud huffs out a laugh and drops the pistol to his side.
MUD	What're you doin' out here? Ellis slowly raises the backpack in his hand.
ELLIS	I got you some Beanie Weenie. Mud tucks the pistol into his jeans and accepts the backpack.
MUD	I appreciate that, but I didn't expect you out here at night.
MUD	Look at that. You really know how to do somebody right. I didn't wanna say anything before, but it's hard to make a meal out of pumpkin pie filling.
ELLIS	That's all my mom had.
MUD	I'm not complainin'.
ELLIS	Can I get one of those?
MUD	They're yours to begin with.
ELLIS	I missed my dinner.
MUD	That's good right?
ELLIS
	You been out here too long.
ELLIS	The girl you're waitin' on, she's your girlfriend?
MUD	Juniper. Yeah.
ELLIS	How'd you meet her?
MUD	We grew up together.
ELLIS	Do you love her?
MUD	I do. The first time I saw her was on this river. Just up from here. She saved my life.
ELLIS	From the snake bite.
MUD	That's right. I was younger than you are now, but when I came to in the hospital and she was there, it was like the world split open, came back together new. Everything changed. I knew from then on I'd do anything for her.
ELLIS	Why aren't ya'll married?
MUD	I've asked. Several times. Marriage just doesn't work for some people.
ELLIS	My dad says my parents may be gettin' a divorce.
MUD	I'm sorry to hear that.
ELLIS	If it happens, and my mom moves us off the river, they say the government can come take our boat away.
MUD	Who says that?
ELLIS	Everybody. They passed a law so you can't sell your boat. Can't rent it. If the owner leaves, they got you. Game and Fish want `em off the river.
MUD	I've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property, but if your parents love each other, there's always a chance.

MUD	People just sometimes forget why they fell in love in the first place.
ELLIS	I saw Juniper today.
MUD	What?
ELLIS	I didn't talk to her, but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said. You were right. She's pretty.
MUD	Where'd you see her?
ELLIS	At the Piggly Wiggly. I think she's stayin' at a motel by there. The Executive Inn.
MUD	That's good news. Real good news.
ELLIS	Does she know you're out here?
MUD	No. We picked another place to meet. Couple days from now.
ELLIS	You wanna go tonight? I can give you a ride up river.
MUD	Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.
ELLIS	You need me to come get you?
MUD	Naw. I can manage. Hell I got out here didn't I? Ellis smiles. They sit in silence. Ellis stares up at the boat hanging over them, its peeling hull lit by the firelight. Mud pinches the ash from the end of his cigarette, places the stub back in his shirt pocket. Noticing Ellis, Mud tilts his head back to take in the boat.
MUD	It's a helluva thing. Mud pauses, his mind working on something.
MUD	Helluva thing. The two sit by the campfire staring up at the suspended boat.
MARY LEE	Time to get up. She begins picking clothes off the floor. Ellis, in bed, raises up on his elbows. He's tired from a late night.
ELLIS	It's Saturday.
MARY LEE	I'm going to Wal-Mart. I need you to come with me.
ELLIS
	Mom.
MARY LEE	Come on. She pulls the covers off of him.
MARY LEE	Ellis I know what your father told you last night. That's not what I wanted. I wanted to sit you down and talk about it.
ELLIS	What do you wanna talk about? You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house.
MARY LEE	I've spent my whole life on that boat. I don't think it's too much to ask for your...
TROOPER	Can you open the trunk please ma'am?
MARY LEE	Of course.
TROOPER	Have you picked up or seen any hitchhikers today ma'am?
MARY LEE	No sir.
TROOPER	Have you seen this man?
MARY LEE	No sir.
TROOPER	Son, have you seen this man?
ELLIS	No.
TROOPER	We've had reports that he's in this area. If you see him, call 9-1-1 immediately.
MARY LEE	We will officer.
ELLIS	What'd he do?!
ELLIS
	What'd he do?
TROOPER	Move along please.
MARY LEE	My lord. (rolls up her window)

	Please don't tell your father this, but I've been looking at a couple of places. I know it would be a big adjustment for you, but it might end up being something you like. You know living on the river isn't exactly everyone's idea of the good life. Ellis? He looks at her.
ELLIS	(into the Walkie) Neck! Neck, pick up!
NECKBONE	So what's the big deal?
ELLIS	My mom and I were headed to Wal- Mart on 165. There was a roadblock with state troopers. They searched our car and showed us a picture of Mud. They're lookin' for him.
NECKBONE	I knew it! I told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble. Did they say what he did?
ELLIS	No.
NECKBONE	So'd you tell `em where he is?
ELLIS	No. That's why I called you. We gotta warn him.
NECKBONE	What?
ELLIS	He's goin' to get Juniper today. I went out there last night and told him where we saw her. He needs to know people are lookin' for him.
NECKBONE	You think he doesn't know that already? Jesus Ellis, why do you think he's on that island? You don't even know what he's wanted for. Ellis climbs in the boat and Neckbone yanks his shoulder.
NECKBONE	Ellis! I'm serious. We don't know who this guy is.
ELLIS	He loves her Neck. He told me.
NECKBONE	I don't give a shit who he loves. Ellis starts the motor and waits for his friend.
ELLIS	He's not dangerous. Reluctantly, Neckbone throws his leg into the boat.
NECKBONE	It sounds like a shitload of state troopers think different.
NECKBONE	No tellin' where the hell he's been sleepin'.
ELLIS	He may already be gone.
MUD	Up here! Mud drops them a rope with knots tied in it. Ellis starts inching his way up. Neckbone begrudgingly follows.
ELLIS	What are you doin'?
MUD	I'm gonna have to go back on our deal for the boat. I don't feel good about it, but I don't see any other way outta what I'm into. Neckbone makes his way on board. Mud has pulled a panel off the steering column. Exposed wires dangle.
ELLIS	So you know about the state troopers? He looks up from his notebook.
MUD	What state troopers?
NECKBONE	The ones spreadin' your picture all over the place. Stoppin' cars on 165 searchin' for your ass. Mud factors this in and then goes back to writing.
MUD	I didn't know about that, but it doesn't surprise me. There plenty of folks lookin' for me right now.
ELLIS	Why?
MUD	I shot a man. Killed him.
MUD	I'm sorry I didn't tell ya'll sooner, but I was hopin' to be gone before anything came of it. Didn't want you involved.
MUD	Ya'll have been real good to me. You're the only friends I got out here. If the state troopers have 165 blocked, they'll have others blocked too. I won't get anywhere in a car. I want to try takin' this boat down, see if we can get it in the water.
MUD	With a boat like this I can make it to the gulf in two days. I could get anywhere from there. But I'd need a boat at least this big to make it on open water. It's got no title, no owner, nobody lookin' for it. It's my best shot.
NECKBONE	Who'd you kill?
MUD	It was a bad piece of business. Ya'll don't need to hear about it.
ELLIS	I need to hear about it.
MUD	Juniper made a mistake. She hooked up with a guy. He was no good. His name was Hutchins. Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas.
ELLIS	Where were you?
MUD	I was around, but me and Juniper were on the outs. She met this Hutchins, he sold her on some lies. Got her pregnant. That's when he started showin' who he really was. He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin' her half to death. She lost the baby. He made it so the doctors think she can't have children anymore. There're things you can get away with in this world and things you can't. I tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio. He was there with another woman. That's where it happened.
MUD	I understand if you can't help me anymore, but I need this boat. And I need to get it in the water fast.
MUD	I've made a list. Things we'll need. What do ya'll think?
ELLIS	You did it for her? To protect her?
MUD	Yeah.
MUD	What do you think?
NECKBONE	I think you want us to run around, stickin' our necks out, gettin' everything you need, just so you can take our boat.
MUD	That's about it.
NECKBONE	What do we get out of it?
MUD	What do you want?
NECKBONE	What about that pistol?
MUD	I only got two things out here worth anything. This shirt...
MUD	And this pistol. I can't give you the shirt `cause I need it for protection, but if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol's yours.
NECKBONE	What kind is it?
MUD	A forty five.
NECKBONE	I guess we could work a deal like that.
MUD	We get this thing floatin' first.
NECKBONE	All right then.
MUD	Ya'll scrounge what you can off this list, but if we're gonna get this done right we'll need more help. Can you fetch Tom for me?
ELLIS	Tom Blankenship? Mud has smoked down to the filter. He crushes the butt into his palm and puts it back in his shirt pocket.
MUD	I was hopin' to let that old assassin stay put, but we'll need him to get things ya'll can't. Can you find him?
ELLIS	I know where he lives, but I've never spoke to him.
MUD	Just tell him my name. He'll know you're serious. Ellis folds the list up. He and Neckbone start down the rope as Mud goes back to the wiring.
MUD	Boys?
	Thanks. Ellis nods.
NECKBONE	Don't lose my pistol. They continue down the rope. Mud continues his work.
ELLIS	You comin'?
NECKBONE	I'll watch the boat. Ellis scans the woods that populate the patch of land wedged between the river and this short tributary.
NECKBONE	Ellis?
ELLIS	What?
NECKBONE	Be careful. Galen always said that old man's crazy. Neckbone keeps his seat as Ellis darts into the woods
TOM	You deaf boy? I said why're you huntin' me?
ELLIS	I ain't huntin you.
TOM	What's your business here?
ELLIS	I came to find you. I got a message for you.
TOM	You're Senior's boy.
ELLIS	Yessir.
TOM	What you got to say he can't tell me himself? Tom, rusty on pleasantries, brushes past Ellis as he heads inside the boat.
ELLIS	It ain't from him. Ellis, not wanting to follow further, shouts from the planks.
ELLIS
TOM	Mud sent you.
ELLIS	Yessir.
TOM	What do you know about it?
ELLIS	He asked me to come get you. Tom straightens his back. He looks into the woods, searching for something he may have missed.
TOM	Your daddy know this?
ELLIS	No sir. Mud needs your help. Tom's mind churns on a series of facts unknown to the boy.
TOM	Where is he?
ELLIS	There he is. Tom spits onto the muddy bank and makes his way toward Mud. Ellis and Neckbone stay by the boat and watch.
TOM	Mud.
MUD	Sir. They stare at each other for a long moment. Neither one flinching.
NECKBONE	You think that's his dad?
ELLIS	I don't know.
TOM	Where is she?
MUD	In town. Got here yesterday. Tom lowers his head. Frustrated.
TOM	Why you out here like this?
NECKBONE	They don't look like family.
NECKBONE	He's really givin' it to him.
TOM	You've spent your whole life followin' that girl! She's run you halfway cross the country and back, and for what? For this, left out on an island beggin' for help. A murderer. A thief.
MUD	I ain't no thief.
TOM	What would you call it then? Don't even mention draggin' those boys into this. Do you have any idea what you're doin'?
TOM	I'm ashamed of you.
TOM	Don't expect help from me. There's none to be given.
TOM	I'm ready.
TOM
	Dammit.
ELLIS	You all right?
MUD	Looks like we're on our own.
MUD	I didn't want you bein' the one to do this, but I can't see a way around it. I need to get this letter to Juniper. Could you take it to her for me?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD	You have to be careful. You can't just walk up and knock on her door, you hear me? You have to watch yourself.
ELLIS	I can handle it.
NECKBONE	You Mud's daddy?
TOM	Mud didn't have no daddy. No mother I ever knew of. He was livin' in the woods when I met him. Younger than you are now. Tom doesn't offer anymore. Neckbone thinks on his answer. Ellis kills the engine near the mouth of Shelly's Oxbow. Tom jumps down into the knee deep river and wades onto shore. He turns back to the boys.
TOM	Ya'll need to watch yourselves. Don't go gettin' into something you don't have any business in. Mud's into something you don't want any part of. I suggest you forget about him. Ellis and Neckbone don't respond. Tom, with a final admonishing look, disappears into the woods. Ellis cranks the motor and points the boat up river.
ELLIS	What do you think?
NECKBONE	He loves her. You can tell that much. You gonna take it to her?
ELLIS	I told him I would. Neckbone thinks about this seriously, shakes his head.
NECKBONE	I don't know. Could be a lot of trouble.
ELLIS	You still got that trailer you made for your bike?
ELLIS	I say we start at the top, work our way down.
NECKBONE	All right. They each grab an end of the cooler and carry it across the lot toward a flight of stairs.
BLACK MAN	What you want?
ELLIS	We're sellin' fish. You wanna buy some?
BLACK MAN	Fish? He looks at the two boys like they are insane.
CARVER	You hear me bitch? Tell me another lie. Ellis rushes Carver with his shoulder as if he were breaking down a door. Carver is knocked off balance. He trips over the edge of the bed and crashes into the motel room wall. Carver, slightly stunned, gets to his feet and in two broad steps lands a man-sized punch across Ellis' face. It's hard. Ellis melts. He grabs the boy up by the scruff of his shirt.
CARVER	Who are you!? Who the hell are you!? Did he send you!? Carver removes a piece of paper from his pocket. It's a photo copied picture of Mud, different than the State Trooper's. Carver crams the photo in the boy's face.
CARVER	You know this man!? Look at him! Do you know him!? Blood trickles from a cut under Ellis' eye. He stutters under the shaking force of Carver's hands.
ELLIS	I don't...I...
NECKBONE	We're just selling fish!
CARVER	I know you know where he is. And I swear to God I'll cut through every one a you to find him.
CARVER	We know you came here for him, and we know he's too stupid to leave you behind. So when he pops his head out of whatever shithole he's staying in, I'll be there. You tell him that.
CARVER	And you need to mind your business boy.
NECKBONE	You all right?
ELLIS	Yeah.
NECKBONE	He popped your eye.
JUNIPER	Thank you.
JUNIPER	I'm so sorry.
JUNIPER	Here.
JUNIPER	How much is your fish? I'll buy the cooler full.
ELLIS	Mud sent us to give this to you.
JUNIPER	You've met Mud?
NECKBONE	Yeah we met him.
JUNIPER	He tells me to hold tight.
NECKBONE	Yeah, we read it.
JUNIPER	Well do you know how long `hold tight' is?
ELLIS	I think it's a couple days. He wants to get a boat for ya'll.
JUNIPER	God.
JUNIPER	Tell him I'll wait.
JUNIPER	But I don't want ya'll involved. Tell him what I said and make that it. I don't want you gettin' in any trouble.
ELLIS	We won't.
JUNIPER	What do you call that?
ELLIS	We'll be all right. Keep your door locked. We'll be in touch.
JUNIPER	Wait.
JUNIPER	What's your name?
ELLIS	I'm Ellis. That's Neckbone.
JUNIPER	Thank you Ellis. Ellis stares at her, infatuated.
NECKBONE	We gotta go. Ellis turns and grabs one end of the cooler. Neckbone slaps back the security latch and opens the door with his free hand. They walk out.
ELLIS	Lock the door. She smiles. The door slams shut. The room number, 212, stares Ellis in the face. He takes a deep breath.
NECKBONE	Let's go hard on. He and Ellis wrangle the cooler down the steps. The sun set while they were inside. A blue hue hangs over everything.
ELLIS	Hello? Is May Pearl there?...This is Ellis...Hey, it's Ellis. Hey... What?...In the phone book... from his car commercials...I think they're all right...Tomorrow? Yeah, I can meet you... Okay. Bye. Ellis hangs up the phone. With the peas pressed firmly against his face, he smirks.
NECKBONE
MUD	This'll work for now. You get her my note?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD	Where'd you get that from?
ELLIS	We came up on Juniper's room. A guy was in there beatin' up on her.
NECKBONE	Ellis rushed him. Got smacked for it.
MUD	What'd he look like?
ELLIS	I don't know. Tall. Looked like a cowboy.
MUD	Dark hair?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD
MUD
MUD	Thanks for lookin' after her.
MUD	His name's Carver. Brother of the man I shot. If he's here, then more are comin'.
NECKBONE	More what? Mud gathers the supplies and heads to the treeline. The boys, with their hands full, follow him.
MUD	Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten, but his daddy's the one to be scared of. He'll spend all the money he has to see me dead. If it was up to me I'd put the whole family down same as the other. Not a decent man between `em. Mud stops and turns to lay a serious look on them.
MUD	Ya'll listen to me now. If you see that old man, don't get near him. He's the triple six real deal scratch you hear me? Mud waits for nods from them both.
MUD	All right.
HELPER	What you waitin' for?
GALEN	Shut up. After a moment, Galen cranks the motor and speeds away.
MUD	Ellis, can you climb up that trunk and get these hung?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD	Take a foot of line and tie `em off with a bowline knot. You know it?
ELLIS	I'm not stupid.
MUD	Neck, start cuttin' line. Three fifteen foot sections. Count a foot long as your arm.
NECKBONE	What's so special `bout that shirt you'd lose your pistol for it?
MUD	It's got a wolf's eye sewn in the sleeve. More protection than a bullet ever gave. Tom swears by it.
NECKBONE	He said he wasn't your daddy.
MUD	Tom's the closest thing I ever knew to a father.
NECKBONE	I never met my parents.
MUD	It's hard not knowin' the ones you came from.
NECKBONE	My uncle Galen tells me things about `em. He's the one that takes care of me.
MUD	Tom did that for me.
ELLIS	What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin?
MUD	Tom's had lives you'd never know about. Grew up up North. Went to Yale. For a long time he was a paid killer for the C.I.A. Lived in Cuba in `63. He's probably killed more people than you've met.
	Hand me that line. Neckbone tosses him an end of rope, looks to Ellis. Ellis gives a shrug before heading back up the trunk.
NECKBONE	Well if you're gonna do it do it! Mud takes a deep breath and yanks the cord. Angled on one of the main branches holding up the boat, Mud begins cutting. Ellis and Neckbone step further and further back as they watch the chainsaw work through the thick limb. Suddenly, the chainsaw stops. A deep CRACKING sound. The huge branch SNAPS, tumbling off lower limbs before crashing to the ground. Mud holds onto the trunk for dear life. The branch now rests on the ground, SILENCE. The ropes and pulleys hang taught, squeaking from the weight of the boat. Mud slowly lifts his head up. He smiles at what he sees. The rigging has held.
MUD	One down! Neckbone and Ellis watch as Mud scampers around the trunk to the next branch. The chainsaw cranks back on.
NECKBONE	This shit is crazy.
AFTERNOON	Ellis looks out the car window at HIGH SCHOOL KIDS that have gathered in the Piggly Wiggly parking lot. His hair is slicked to one side, and he's wearing a collared shirt.
MARY LEE	You look nice.
ELLIS	Thanks.
MARY LEE	What time are you gonna be home? Ellis shrugs. She looks at him as the car radio rambles.
ELLIS	You make up your mind?
MARY LEE	About moving in town?
ELLIS	About leavin' dad. Mary Lee thinks about how to answer, shuts off the radio.
MARY LEE	You can't make other people change Ellis. If I'm unhappy then I'll have to be the one to change something. Ellis chews on the inside of his cheek and watches her avoid eye contact. He shoulders his way out of the car. Mary Lee takes a moment before driving off. As Mary Lee pulls away, Ellis takes in the scene.
ELLIS	Not really.
MAY PEARL	But you're not scared if you have to.
ELLIS	I guess. You got a lot of friends.
MAY PEARL	They're all right. I don't know all of `em.
ELLIS	I bet you're pretty popular.
MAY PEARL	Why do you say that?
ELLIS	I don't know. `Cause you're nice to people.
MAY PEARL	How do you know that?
ELLIS	You're nice to me.
MAY PEARL	But I like you.
ELLIS	I got this for you.
MAY PEARL	A bracelet?
ELLIS	Neckbone's uncle caught the pearls. I thought with your name and everything...
MAY PEARL	Thank you.
ELLIS	You wanna be my girlfriend? She smiles, then kisses him.
TOM	You want some coffee? Tom disappears inside.
ELLIS	I don't drink coffee. Ellis waits for a moment, but realizes this is Tom's way of inviting him inside. He enters.
TOM	You been seein' Mud?
ELLIS	No.
TOM	You don't have to lie to me boy.
TOM	I've seen you runnin' around. Takin' things. He all right?
ELLIS	He's okay.
TOM	He get that boat down?
ELLIS	He called you an assassin.
ELLIS	Is it true?
TOM	How long have you known Mud?
ELLIS	Few days.
TOM	Well that's long enough to know he's full of shit.
ELLIS	So it's not true.
TOM	I was a sharpshooter in the army. In Mud's world, that makes me an assassin. Not exactly true, right?
ELLIS	Yeah I guess.
TOM	You think he's a bad ass don't you?
ELLIS	I don't know.
TOM	You know why he's stuck out on that island?
ELLIS	Yeah.
	He shot somebody.
TOM	He tell you why he shot that man?
ELLIS	Because he hurt Juniper.
TOM	Right. The real reason Mud's in the trouble he's got is because of her. He's been in love with that girl since he was your age. They used to run all around here and it was the same back then. He'd follow that girl wherever she led him. Problem is she don't care about nobody but herself. I've told him as much. She'd bed down with the meanest snake she could find, then when things went bad she'd go runnin' to Mud. Mud would take her back, then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat `em `til they knew to never touch her again. And this time I guess he thought a beating wasn't good enough. Had to shoot that fella. I don't know for sure, but I'd put money on Juniper knowin' he'd do it. And I have a suspicion she might of even told him to. Either way, those two are set for failure. Only chance Mud has is to cut her loose. Cause I'll tell you what, Mud's no bad ass. He's runnin' scared.
ELLIS	I gotta go.
ELLIS	You're wrong about Juniper. They love each other and they're gonna make it. If you weren't a wore out old man you'd know it was true. Tom eyes the boy, taking a sip from his cup. He nods a goodbye to Ellis who is already out the door.
ELLIS	I got more stuff.
MUD	You find a motor?
ELLIS	Not yet. (points to the ash) What's that?
MUD	I made a bonfire. Mud enters the woods. Ellis follows.
ELLIS	Why?
MUD	Bonfire's an all purpose cure all for bad luck. I don't know where this boat's been or what kind of person had it before me. For all I know it could have some serious bad business left on it. We got too much ridin' on this thing to leave to chance. Where's Neckbone?
ELLIS	Helpin' his uncle with a dive.
ELLIS	Tom called me over to his place this mornin'.
MUD	What he say?
ELLIS	He was runnin' down Juniper. Ellis looks for a response, but Mud just jumps up into the boat and starts throwing pieces of wood on shore.
ELLIS	I told him he was a wore out old man. Told him he couldn't know how much you loved Juniper.
MUD	You don't know his story.
ELLIS	I don't care.
MUD	You should. Tom loved a woman more than most men could in two lifetimes. They had a good life started together. Mud hops down and scoops a load of wood into his arms.
MUD	She was pregnant with a little boy, but the birth got the better of `em. They didn't make it. Tom's been alone ever since. Lone wolf. Mud has begun walking back to the treeline. Ellis stays.
ELLIS	I gotta go help my dad. Mud turns back but doesn't stop moving.
MUD	Thanks for the wood Ellis. Ellis watches him go, thinking on what he said.
GALEN	This shit never gets easy.
NECKBONE	That's a good haul.
GALEN	I've had worse. Galen reclines as Neckbone kills the air compressor and begins organizing the gear. He watches his little nephew.
GALEN	You doin' all right?
NECKBONE	Yeah.
GALEN	You don't need to tell me anything?
NECKBONE	Tell you what?
GALEN	I know I'm just your uncle, not much of a parent. But you can tell me things if you need to.
NECKBONE	I can tell you this helmet smells like my duck butter.
SENIOR	Where'd you get that black eye?
ELLIS	A kid in town. He got his too.
SENIOR	What you fightin' for?
ELLIS	`Bout a girl.
SENIOR	What girl?
ELLIS	My girlfriend.
SENIOR	You got a girlfriend?
ELLIS	Yes sir.
SENIOR	When'd that happen?
ELLIS	Other day. Senior pats his shirt pocket and finds a smoke. Lights it.
SENIOR	You seen your mother today?
ELLIS	No.
SENIOR	You not talkin' to me?
ELLIS	I'm talkin'. I'm talkin' to both of you. That's all ya'll want to do is talk.
SENIOR	Well, that's your mother. Would rather tongue lash a problem than step up and handle it. You'll see one day. Women are tough. They'll set you up for things. You can't trust love, Ellis. If you're not careful, it'll run out on you. You just gotta pick a woman and roll the dice. Hope you don't wake up in fifteen years hatin' each other. Ellis keeps staring out the window as they pull into the parking lot of the Catfish Parlour Restaurant.
CONTINUOUS	Senior climbs out of the truck and enters the restaurant. Ellis pops open the tailgate and reaches for a cooler. The Catfish Parlour is one business in a strip center row. There is nothing else around save for farmland and a motel across the road. Ellis notices Carver's black LINCOLN parked in the motel lot. He walks away from the truck to get a better look. Ellis scans the FOUR OTHER VEHICLES in the lot. All Texas plates. A maroon Cadillac sails past and turns into the motel. Ellis recedes to the rear of his truck. He watches as KING(76), a fireplug of a man, emerges from the Cadillac. Cramped from a long drive, he stretches and eyes the sign for the Pines Motel. A motel room door opens and Carver walks out. He's smiling and calls out to King. They hug as a green PICK-UP pulls up. MILLER, a slick dressed man in black boots, climbs out.
CARVER	Daddy this is Miller. He's one of ours.
KING
	How do you do? Appreciate your help.
MILLER	Yes sir.
CARVER	We'll be in in a minute. Miller nods and enters the motel room. King turns to Carver.
KING	Catch me up.
CARVER	They work in shifts. Two outside her motel, the others either out searching or sleepin' here. I met with the county sheriff but he wasn't much help. Said they'd handle their own business, but I got two of their people on payroll and a person on the inside at the state police.
KING	Good. Doin' good. Who all's here?
CARVER	All but two now. Nelson and James are watchin' her place. I called the rest in.
KING	Okay. Let's meet the men. Carver leads his father to the motel room.
CARVER	Get up. (to the others) Ya'll pay attention.
CARVER	This is my father, King. He runs the show.
KING	Men. I wanna thank you for the work you're doin'. It's important work, and I want you to know what it means to me personally. I'm grateful for it. No man should have to bury his son. It's not natural, and it's a pain I hope none of you ever have to endure.
KING	This man did that to me. He took my youngest boy. And now, you're gonna help me get him.
KING	Now gather `round. Come on now, in a circle. I want ya'll to join hands.
KING	Everybody take a knee.
KING	Bow your heads. I need you to help me pray for the death of the man that killed my son.
NECKBONE	You touch her breast?
ELLIS	A little.
NECKBONE	That's great man.
ELLIS	Thanks. Ellis walks up and knocks a stack of bricks off the trailer.
ELLIS	We could take it apart. Bring it out piece by piece.
NECKBONE	It's welded. We'd just tear it up. What if we float it out?
ELLIS	With what?
NECKBONE	Come on. Neckbone walks to the trailer. Ellis follows.
NECKBONE	Jesus! They squint and shield their eyes. The light shuts off as quickly as it came on. Galen stands in front of them wearing his wet suit. The bar with the flood lights attached sits across his shoulders. The boys rub their eyeballs, seeing spots. Galen shuffles over to the couch holding a marine battery connected to the lights. He labors to take a seat.
GALEN	What do you think?
NECKBONE	That's real good Galen.
	Gimme a minute.
GALEN	Come `ere Ellis.
GALEN
	You see that ceiling fan?
ELLIS	Yeah.
GALEN	I found it in the river. Works great. Best ceiling fan I've ever owned. This river brings a lotta trash down it. Some a that trash is worth a lotta money, some of it's not. You gotta know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go. You know the difference?
ELLIS	I think so.
GALEN	Neck looks up to you. Don't get my nephew into anything you can't get him out of.
GALEN	Help Me Rhonda's just about a guy needing to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him. So you get your heart broke, don't walk around with a shit look on your face. Get back in there. Get your tip wet. You hear me?
ELLIS	What?
GALEN	You know what I'm sayin'.
GALEN	Ya'll wanna hang out? Alan's comin' over. We're gonna pump it up.
NECKBONE	We got stuff to do.
GALEN	Whatever. The boys exit as Galen turns on the amp.
NECKBONE	What were ya'll talkin' about?
ELLIS	I don't know.
MUD	King. That's what they call him. A BOAT TRAILER rests atop FOUR, 55-GALLON BRIGHT YELLOW BARRELS affixed with plastic zip ties. The make-shift raft is half on shore with the back still floating in the water. The boys watch as Mud walks around the trailer cutting off the zip ties. The barrels kick out from underneath the trailer as this happens.
MUD	He's their father. You didn't go near him did you?
ELLIS	No.
MUD	Good. That left-handed sonofabitch is the devil himself. If he's here, then it's time. We need to get Juniper out here.
ELLIS	We still need a motor.
NECKBONE	There's a motor in the scrap yard might work.
MUD	I need one that runs.
NECKBONE	I can get it runnin'. Tell him Ellis.
ELLIS	It's true. He built his own dirt bike.
MUD	All right then. Give it a shot.
ELLIS	I don't know. That motor's worth somethin'. It's not like this other junk.
NECKBONE	It's been there for months. Nobody's even gonna know it's gone. Ellis hesitates. He looks to Mud.
MUD	We do need a motor. Ellis thinks on it as Mud takes a deep breath and grabs the trailer again.
ELLIS	I wanna talk to room 212.
JUNIPER	Hello?
ELLIS	Juniper?
JUNIPER	Ellis?
ELLIS	It's me.
JUNIPER	Thank god. I've been goin' crazy in this room. Is Mud okay?
ELLIS	Yeah. It's time to take you out to him.
JUNIPER	Now?
ELLIS	Tomorrow. We'll come get you.
JUNIPER	What's goin' on?
ELLIS	He's got a plan for ya'll to get away. Be ready tomorrow at five. Neckbone'll be waitin' at the back of the motel with a dirt bike.
JUNIPER	They're watching my room.
ELLIS	I'll take care of that. Just be ready at five.
JUNIPER	Wait. Just wait. I don't know about alla this. I don't even know what he thinks we're gonna do. Where are we even gonna go? This is Mud. This is what Mud does.
ELLIS	It's okay. He's got the boat. We helped him fix it up. It's a good plan. Just be ready.
JUNIPER	Why are you even doing this?
ELLIS	What do you mean?
JUNIPER	Why are you helping us?
ELLIS	Cause ya'll love each other.
ELLIS	I'll see you tomorrow.
JUNIPER	Wait.
NECKBONE	How'd it go?
ELLIS	We're good.
NECKBONE	Gimme a quarter. This shit took mine. Ellis watches May Pearl entering the grocery store. He calls out with a wave.
ELLIS
NECKBONE	It's all right man. She's with her family. Come on. I wanna get that motor before dark. They head to the dirt bike.
CARVER	You remember me don't you? Ellis nods. Carver notes the healing bruise on Ellis' face.
CARVER	I'm sure sorry about that. Ya'll caught me at a real bad time.
CARVER	Hold on now. One second. I don't want ya'll thinkin' I'm a bad guy. Ya'll were just trying to do a job, and I got in your way.
CARVER	Let's just say I bought that whole batch of fish ya'll were sellin'. Would forty cover it?
NECKBONE	That'd bout do it.
ELLIS	We don't want your money.
CARVER	I bet ya'll really get around this town. Probably know every hole and ditch. Have ya'll come across the man whose picture I showed you?
ELLIS	No.
CARVER	You sure about that? Take a look with your good eye.
ELLIS	I'm sure.
CARVER	What about that girl in the motel? The pretty one. Ya'll talk to her some more?
ELLIS	No.
CARVER	There's a number on there. Ya'll let me know if you do.
NECKBONE	Jesus that's heavy. The boys get on either side of the motor and begin half- dragging it back to the fence line.
NECKBONE	Where are those bastards?
ELLIS	I don't know.
	She's not answerin'.
NECKBONE	What do you wanna do?
ELLIS	Take your bike around the side. I'll check her room. We'll just have to hope no one sees us. Neckbone cranks the bike and speeds toward the motel. Ellis looks to the motel, then the parking lot.
NECKBONE	Shit. Was she there?
ELLIS	Nothin'. Ellis notices the front office
ELLIS	Come on.
ELLIS	Scuse me, sir?
MOTEL CLERK	Yeah.
ELLIS	We're lookin' for the girl in room 212. You seen her?
MOTEL CLERK	I've seen her.
ELLIS	You see her today.
MOTEL CLERK	Yeah, she came down askin' for directions to the nearest bar. I told her to head out to a place on
NECKBONE	You think this is it?
ELLIS	It's gotta be.
BARTENDER	Ya'll stay outta here! Ellis just stands staring at the front door. The Bartender makes a swatting motion toward them.
BARTENDER
NECKBONE	Thanks a lot asshole!
	Come on man. They head over to Neckbone's dirt bike. He pulls out the key and climbs on. Ellis hesitates.
NECKBONE	I'll take you home.
ELLIS	We're gonna have to tell Mud. Neckbone drops his head, nods reluctantly.
ELLIS	Just leave it. Mud'll have to help get it.
NECKBONE	What're you gonna tell him?
ELLIS	I'll just tell him the truth.
ELLIS
MUD	What you say there?! Ellis appears out of the dark, followed by Neckbone. Mud's eyes search the treeline for Juniper.
MUD	What you say Ellis? Ellis can't look him in the eye.
ELLIS	We got that motor.
MUD	Is Juniper okay?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD	Where is she?
ELLIS	She didn't meet up with us.
MUD	What happened? Was it Carver?
ELLIS	It wasn't Carver.
MUD	What's goin' on Ellis?
ELLIS	She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel. She never showed up. We went asking for her. The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61.
MUD	What?
ELLIS	We tracked her down. She was there with another guy.
	They were together.
MUD	She probably thought Carver was on to her.
ELLIS	She knew the plan Mud. She just didn't show up.
MUD	What was she doin' with the other guy?
MUD	What were they doin' Ellis?
ELLIS	They were playin' pool. Drinkin'. He was close up on her. They were laughin'. He kissed her on the neck.
MUD	And that's how it is. He takes the pot of roofing tar over to the boat and begins pasting some of the newly replaced boards with a flat stick.
ELLIS	What do you want us to do?
MUD	Just go home Ellis. Ellis looks at Neckbone, then sets the grocery sack on the ground.
ELLIS	Tom left this for you. They slowly retreat into the woods and disappear. Mud turns back to the campfire and shoves the pot into the ashes. His eyes, soft and red, reflect the flame.
ELLIS	You think it's all right to leave him alone?!
NECKBONE	I doubt it! Neckbone sees Ellis' concern.
NECKBONE	I'll sleep over at your house tonight! We can check on him first thing tomorrow! Ellis nods. As they head further up river, the island grows smaller, silhouetted by the moonlight.
ELLIS	Hello? Is May Pearl there...This is Ellis...I called yesterday, you give her my message?...My name is Ellis. I'm her boyfriend...Oh, she's asleep...I said she's asleep?
SENIOR
SENIOR	What the hell have you been doing?
MARY LEE
SENIOR	You tell her. You tell her what you've been up to.
ELLIS	I don't know what you're sayin'.
MARY LEE	Take your hands off him Senior!
SENIOR	J.J. Crawford said a boat motor went missin' from his stock yard. Said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin' it off.
SENIOR	Now you tell me right now, did you steal that motor?
ELLIS	We didn't steal it.
SENIOR	Lie to me again.
ELLIS	We thought it was junk. We didn't think it was worth anything.
MARY LEE	Ellis?
SENIOR	You tell me I raised a thief?
ELLIS	I'm not a thief.
SENIOR	You take property that's not yours. Property that belongs to another man. That junk is his livelihood. I'm ashamed of you.
MARY LEE	Senior.
SENIOR	(to Mary Lee) Shut your mouth. You think you can take things and not have him see it? Neither one of you has any respect for a man's livelihood. A life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach.
MARY LEE	Don't you blame this on me. One doesn't have a thing to do with the other and you know it.
SENIOR	Don't tell me what I know. If you can steal a man's life out from under him in front of your son and think he won't take a lesson from it than you're even dumber than you look.
ELLIS	Stop it dad.
SENIOR	She's raisin' you a snake like herself, and you can curl up with her `fore I give a damn. You just remember this when you watch them rip this house apart board by board. You Hear Me!
MARY LEE	You're a man who's never had the strength to support his own life. I never asked you for a thing, and I've never took a thing from you that I couldn't provide for on my own. If they do tear my home apart the only joy I'll have in my heart is knowin' that they'll be tearing you out of my life for good.
ELLIS	I can't take that motor back. But I'll pay him for it. I'll pay him what he wants for it.
SENIOR	I don't care what you do Ellis.
NECKBONE	What the hell's all this?
ELLIS	It's a bonfire.
NECKBONE	I guess he didn't care about bein' seen. Ellis kicks at one of the burned logs. He bends down and finds the bottle of Jack Daniels, smashed.
ELLIS	He had something else on his mind. Come on. Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline.
MUD	What are ya'll hidin' for? Mud drops the wiring and scales down to the bank. They emerge from the woods. Ellis carries the yellow shirt.
ELLIS	We found your shirt. Ellis tosses it to him. Mud tosses it back.
MUD	Keep it. I don't need it anymore. Mud goes to the motor at the rear to tinker with more wires.
ELLIS	We saw what's left of your bonfire.
	Somebody could've seen you.
MUD	I guess.
ELLIS	You do some drinkin' last night?
MUD	I did a lot of drinkin' last night.
MUD	Neck I'm gonna need you here to get the motor runnin'. Ellis I need you to do something else for me.
MUD	I need you to take this to Juniper.
ELLIS	Okay Mud.
MUD	Let's go.
ELLIS	You still takin' Juniper?
MUD	I had a dream last night. I saw Juniper laying in a field with another man. They were making love. I walked out into the field. Walked toward `em. I was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin'. That's how I knew I was gonna kill this man. But when I got up close enough, I saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back, just like mine. I moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me. Hair for hair, dead truth, the guy she was with was me.
MUD	I'll finish the boat, but I'd be surprised if I live long enough to sail on it. A vision of yourself is a sure sign of death. Neck can you grab me a socket wrench? Neckbone and Ellis walk to the toolbox sitting nearby. They crouch by it, speaking quietly.
NECKBONE	You be all right?
ELLIS	Yeah. What about you?
NECKBONE	He'll be okay.
ELLIS	Can I borrow your bike? Neckbone fishes the key out of his pocket. Hesitates.
NECKBONE	Don't tump it. Ellis nods. Neckbone walks over to Mud with the toolbox. Letter in hand, Ellis gives a final look toward Mud's labor and walks back into the woods. On his way, he stops to hang Mud's shirt on a tree branch.
ELLIS	(into the phone) Hello. I saw the guy you're lookin' for...Yeah, he's crazy lookin'. Saw him at the Wal-mart outside of Gillet. He was buyin' some beanie weenie...'bout five minutes ago.
JUNIPER	I was wonderin' when I'd see you. Ellis checks over his shoulder and walks inside
JUNIPER	I'm sorry about last night. I didn't plan on... Before she can finish Ellis has fished the letter out of his pocket and holds it out to her.
ELLIS	I'm supposed to give this to you. Juniper takes the letter.
JUNIPER	Okay. Ellis goes to the door. He pulls the bedroom curtain back slightly to check the parking lot. The coast is clear.
JUNIPER	Did you read it?
ELLIS	No. I gotta go.
JUNIPER	Ellis? He turns to her.
JUNIPER	I'm sorry.
ELLIS	All you had to do was be there.
JUNIPER	I couldn't.
ELLIS	Then why'd you even come here?
JUNIPER	I came here to leave with him. I really did. But now...now I guess I just came to say goodbye.
JUNIPER	You don't know us Ellis. We've been headin' this way for a long time.
ELLIS	I know he'd do anything for you.
JUNIPER	You really believe that?
JUNIPER	Mud's a born liar. That's what makes him so likable. He makes people feel good about themselves. He's a romantic. I don't think he means to hurt people. But when people get close to him, that's what happens.
JUNIPER	I do love him Ellis. But I can't spend the rest of my life runnin' with him. I may not know what kind of life I want, but I know that's not it.
JUNIPER	Tell him I understand.
ELLIS	What's it say?
JUNIPER	It says it's over. Tell him I've packed my things. Tell him I've gone. She takes a deep breath and smiles at him.
JUNIPER	Bye Ellis. Ellis turns and walks out.
KYLE	So what'd she say?
MAY PEARL	She said she didn't like him that much. I told her I thought he was all right.
ELLIS	You get my phone calls?
MAY PEARL	What?
ELLIS	I've been callin' you. (motions with his head) Who's this guy?
KYLE	Get your head outta my car kid.
KYLE	Shit!
MAY PEARL	Ellis!
ELLIS	I called you twice yesterday. Your sister didn't tell you?
MAY PEARL	Kyle! Stop it Kyle!
ELLIS	What?
MAY PEARL	You can't just run up and punch people I'm with!
ELLIS	I'm sorry, I just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back.
MAY PEARL	Why would I call you back Ellis?
ELLIS	Because you're my girlfriend.
MAY PEARL	I'm not your girlfriend! We went on one date. One!
ELLIS	We kissed.
MAY PEARL	That doesn't matter!
ELLIS	Yeah but...
MAY PEARL	But what Ellis?! What did you expect?!
ELLIS	I love you.
MAY PEARL	You're fourteen!
ELLIS	Don't. Wait. We can make this work. We can figure it out. I love you.
MAY PEARL	What? Ellis is losing it. His eyes are red. He looks at the crowd of kids. There are smiles and some snickering. May Pearl is speechless. She just stares at him. Ellis turns and walks back to the dirt bike. May Pearl's girlfriends gather around her. She shakes her head, dumbstruck. Ellis lifts the bike off the ground. He looks back at May Pearl who appears to be shrugging off the whole affair in front of her friends. Ellis speeds off.
SENIOR	What the hell are you doin'?! Ellis says nothing. He doesn't move. Senior, continuing to yell, runs and drags a hose up from the houseboat.
SENIOR	Ellis dammit! What the hell's wrong with you?! The fire hisses as Senior turns the hose on it.
SENIOR	Ellis? Look at me. Ellis finally looks up at his father. A phone RINGS from inside the houseboat. Senior holds the hose in front of him.
SENIOR	Take it. Put this damn thing out.
ELLIS	What are you doing? Ellis watches as dresses and blouses begin to shrivel up in the flames.
ELLIS	Stop it! That's mom's stuff! STOP
ELLIS
NECKBONE	Try it now. Mud turns a switch. No result.
MUD	Nothin'.
NECKBONE	Sonofabitch. Ellis emerges from the treeline. Mud sees him and hops down from the boat. He walks up to him.
MUD	What'd she... Ellis punches Mud with as much force as he can muster. It's barely enough to turn Mud's face, but it stuns him.
ELLIS	You're a liar. Makin' two kids run around doin' work you're too scared to do yourself. Makin' me tell her it's over `cause you're too scared to do it yourself. Mud steps back and gives the boy his space. Neckbone has made his way over and watches from behind Mud.
ELLIS	You said you loved her and you lied. You gave up on her and she gave up on you just like everybody else. I trusted you. Bonfires and crosses. Wolf's eye bullshit. Mud tries to approach him but the boy explodes, shoving him.
ELLIS
MUD	Come on Ellis. Mud holds a hand out to him. Ellis slaps it away.
ELLIS	You made me a thief! Ellis walks back into the woods. Mud exhales and turns back to Neckbone.
NECKBONE	Let me talk to him.
NECKBONE	Ellis! Ellis, stop for a second! Neckbone watches as Ellis reaches the tree trunk that bridges the creek. Ellis steps onto the log, but his muddy shoes miss a step. He SLIPS. Neckbone sees Ellis disappear down into the creek bed.
NECKBONE
NECKBONE
NECKBONE
NECKBONE
MUD	Get the motor started. Neckbone cranks the motor. As they move up river, Mud searches Ellis' body. He looks at his neck, his arms, he pulls up his shirt.
NECKBONE	IS HE OKAY?! Is he bit?! Mud notices Ellis' jeans leg riding up. He pulls the jeans back. A BITE in the middle of his calf. It's a bluish bruise with two distinct red dots. The skin around the bite has already begun to swell.
MUD	Shit. He rips the jeans up to the thigh. Mud tears a section of cloth from the bottom of his own shirt and creates a tourniquet just below Ellis' knee.
MUD	What time is it? Mud pulls a black Sharpie out of his pocket. Neckbone doesn't answer, just stares.
MUD
NECKBONE	It's four eighteen! Mud draws a line on Ellis' leg just above the swollen bite. He writes, "418".
MUD	Yell out every 10 minutes! Mud elevates Ellis' leg then gently cups his head. He dabs the gash on Ellis' forehead.
NECKBONE	Is he gonna be okay?!
MUD	We just need to get him to a clinic! Is there still one in town?!
NECKBONE	Yeah!
MUD	It's the closest?!
NECKBONE	Yeah!
MUD	I'm gonna need your bike!
NECKBONE	Are you bit?! Mud shakes his head.
MUD	No. He holds Ellis as they move steadily up river.
NECKBONE	My bike should be just over that ridge! Mud looks at Ellis' leg. The swelling has crept up his thigh. Black lines with numbers mark its progress: "428, 438, 448". Ellis' face has taken on a blue tint.
MUD
FEMALE NURSE	Just stay calm. What's going on?
MUD	He's been snake bit. ANOTHER NURSE rushes off calling for a doctor. The room becomes more frenzied. Patients talking. Nurses shouting.
MUD	He's snake bit. A cotton mouth. On his calf. Just under an hour. As quickly as Mud gets this out, a GROUP of NURSES rush out of a door at the end of the room pushing a gurney. They take Ellis from Mud's arm, place him on the gurney, and speed him into the back of the clinic. The commotion gone, the reception area feels oddly still. Mud takes a deep breath. He looks to his right. Patients stare at him. He's beyond disheveled. He's crazy looking. Mud turns to his left. The Male Nurse stares at him. For the first time, Mud realizes he's out in the open.
MALE NURSE	Sir? Mud slowly backs up.
MALE NURSE	Sir?! Mud hops into the bank of trees and disappears.
KING	Hello...Yes...Yessir we are...Uh huh. King takes a pen from his shirt pocket and scribbles on a pad on the nightstand.
KING	Now where'd you say you were?...Okay...He's gone. Okay...But you say he left the boy?...And your name sir?
MARY LEE	It's okay. You're okay. Just set back. Mary Lee guides Ellis back down on the pillow. Senior stands with his arm on her shoulder. They look down at their son.
ELLIS	Where am I?
MARY LEE	You're home. We got you home. Ellis takes a second to get his bearings. His mother lifts a glass of Sprite up to his mouth. He takes a sip.
SENIOR	You had us scared son. Senior steps forward and kisses Ellis on the forehead. Staying close to his face.
SENIOR
	I'm so glad you're okay.
MARY LEE	The doctors gave you some medicine. You had a snake bite.
ELLIS	How'd I get to the doctor?
MARY LEE	A man brought you in. No one knew him. Ellis tries to sit up in bed, but his mother stops him.
ELLIS	No. Senior gently pats her shoulders.
SENIOR	Come on. Let's let him rest. Mary Lee touches Senior's hand on her shoulder. She stands.
MARY LEE	I'll be back in to check on you but just try and sleep if you can.
ELLIS	Okay. Senior leads Mary Lee to the door.
ELLIS	Mom? Dad? They turn back.
ELLIS	I love ya'll.
MARY LEE	We love you too Ellis. They exit the room. Ellis rests his head back on the pillow and takes a deep breath.
MUD
	Almost there.
MUD	The sun does shine on a dog's ass some days.
NECKBONE	It ain't sunk yet.
NECKBONE	I wish Ellis could see it.
MUD	I know.
MUD	I owe you your end of the deal.
NECKBONE	Where the bullets?
MUD	The deal was for the gun, not the bullets.
NECKBONE	Shit.
MUD	I got one last favor to ask you.
MUD	Ellis?
ELLIS	Mud?
MUD	Yeah. Mud pulls his body through the window. It's tight but he manages to make it look somewhat graceful. Mud takes a quick survey of the dark room. Ellis begins to get out of bed.
MUD	No, don't get up. Mud motions him back down and pulls the chair from the desk over to the bed. They speak in hushed voices.
ELLIS	How'd you get here?
MUD	Neck brought me.
MUD	We got the boat in the water.
ELLIS	You did?
MUD	Just now. Smooth sailin' from here on out.
ELLIS	Good.
MUD	Wish you coulda seen it.
ELLIS	Me too.
MUD	Didn't feel right leavin' town without sayin' goodbye.
ELLIS	I'm sorry `bout what I said.
MUD	No. No. You were right to be mad. You were right about a lot of things. I'm the one that's sorry. I shoulda never gotten ya'll into all this. I just didn't see any other way around it. But I couldn't leave without you knowin' I never lied about being your friend. I never lied about that.
ELLIS	I know.
MUD	I don't traffic in the truth too often. But I did love her. I do love her.
ELLIS	She loves you too. She said it.
MUD	I just made mistakes. We both did. This is a hard life to keep up with. You can't blame her for gettin' tired of tryin'.
ELLIS	My dad says you can't count on women lovin' you. He says you can't trust it.
MUD	That's not true. Don't judge your life on all of our mistakes. You'll make plenty mistakes of your own, no need takin' on everybody else's. You're a good man Ellis. If you find a girl half as good, you'll be all right.
ELLIS	You're a good man too Mud. Mud smiles.
MUD	No. I'm not. But maybe from here on out I can be... A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a fist-sized hole in the flimsy interior wall. Mud, as if by reflex, yanks Ellis from the sheets and shoves him under the bed.
ELLIS	Mud?!
MUD	Stay put! JUST STAY UNDER THERE! The SOUND of shotgun shells being slipped into the chamber. Mud gets to a crouch. Through the holes in the wall, Mud makes out Nelson, the fat bounty hunter, reloading his gun.
SENIOR
MUD
	Don't move Ellis. Just stay put. They just want me. Through the holes Mud sees Nelson approaching Ellis' bedroom. He runs for the window at the foot of the bed. Another shotgun BLAST throws open the door as Mud leaps out.
A141	partially lit by the two flood lights. FOUR other BOUNTY HUNTERS swarm the boat.
CARVER	Let him go. James unhands the boy. Neckbone sprints into the woods.
CARVER	Come on. They move toward the houseboat.
MUD	You still down there bud?
ELLIS	Yeah.
MUD	Stay put. Mud pops out of the bedroom into the den.
CARVER	Flush him out this way. Carver walks to the covered carport.
ELLIS
ELLIS
TOM
ELLIS
SENIOR
SENIOR	It's okay. It's okay. The two sit alone on the edge of the houseboat. The river seems especially quiet now.
KING	Hello...You're speaking to him... King listens. His face taut.
KING	He's dead? (a long pause) Okay. King hangs up the phone. He sits at the edge of the bed, overwhelmed by the news.
NECKBONE	Hey.
ELLIS	You got your bike back.
NECKBONE	Mud dinged the shit out of it. Neckbone takes a seat next to Ellis. They watch the workers.
NECKBONE	They're really doin' it.
ELLIS	It's the law.
NECKBONE	It's bullshit. They ever find Tom? The boys focus on Tom Blankenship's boat across the bayou. It sits vacant, covered in police tape.
ELLIS	No. He's gone.
NECKBONE	Your dad not here?
ELLIS	Said he couldn't watch it. He's pickin' me up in a minute. Got deliveries today. They sit in silence as the Workers exit off the houseboat.
NECKBONE	Heard on the news. They still hadn't found Mud's body. Ellis nods.
NECKBONE	You think he's dead?
ELLIS	I don't know. I hope not. The crane begins lifting up the houseboat. The metal wires tighten and the entire structure creaks. A sucking sound as the flotilla separate from the water. The boat hangs, suspended in the air. A HORN HONKS behind the boys. Ellis turns to see Senior's truck.
ELLIS	I gotta go. Come by the apartment. Help me set my room up.
NECKBONE	All right. Neckbone watches Ellis climb into the bed of the pick-up and take his spot on the coolers. The sound of twisting metal shifts his attention back to the houseboat being swung over a flatbed semi.
ELLIS	I'll see you next week?
SENIOR	Yeah. Ellis begins to get out but stops when Senior speaks.
SENIOR	Ellis? You mind your mother okay? This is a big change for her. She needs your support.
ELLIS	Yessir.
SENIOR	All right. I love you.
ELLIS	Love you too. Ellis climbs out. He watches as Senior pulls away. He stands alone in front of the apartments, studying the surroundings. A busy road out front. A gas station and collection of stores. A lot of people and commotion. A compact car pulls into a parking spot one building down. Ellis watches as three COLLEGE AGE GIRLS climb out dressed in running shorts and t-shirts. Two are heavy set, the other is petite. They joke and laugh. One sees Ellis and waves. Ellis nods to her. He tracks them as they walk inside. Ellis smirks.
TOM	Come on son. You need to see this. Mud, groggy, raises up. Tom helps him to his feet, putting an arm over his shoulders. Tom practically carries Mud outside.
