Only God Forgives

BILLY	... I love violence!
JULIAN	Two fifty, three hundred...
JULIAN	You did well out there. You've got something, Liang. Potential, yeah?
JULIAN	Don't spend it all in once place.
JULIAN
JULIAN
JULIAN
JULIAN	He still in there?
THE LIZARD	... No.
JULIAN	You told him I was coming...
THE LIZARD	Wouldn't listen...
JULIAN	Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
JULIAN	When was the last time you slept?
THE LIZARD	Just cause I ain't slept for three days, don't mean I don't know right from wrong... and your brother has become a real problem...
JULIAN	No.
THE LIZARD	Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and then he broke my face...
GORDON	Like I always said. One day he's going to meet the devil.
JULIAN	You know where he is now?
THE LIZARD	Bangkok has millions of people my friend. You and your brother, you're lost to my world...
JULIAN	You go. I'm gonna look around. See if I can find him.
GORDON	Sure--?
JULIAN	Go on.
JULIAN	Which way'd he go?
THE LIZARD	His brother didn't pay.
GORDON	So? That's his problem.
THE LIZARD	Now it's your problem.
GORDON	I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--
THE LIZARD	You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
GORDON	How much...?
JULIAN	You seen Billy?
MA LONG	Not this evening.
JULIAN	Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah?
MA LONG	He's not coming in. I tell him to stay away. He hurt one of my girls Julian. Not good...
JULIAN	Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him...
DAENG	Who is that guy?
DAENG	Is he a cop?
PHAIBAN	He was...
CHANG	Is this your daughter? Yes.
CHANG	How could you? ... What?
CHANG	How could you let this happen? I didn't do anything.
CHANG	Well now's your chance.
CHANG	Do what thou will. You missed my turning. I live that way.
KIM	We'll get you there. I'm so sorry. Please. Please. Please don't hurt me. I'm so sorry.
CHANG	What are you sorry for? I thought... You were there. He killed my daughter. I thought you were letting me...
CHANG	Answer the question. What are you sorry for? I killed the Westerner?
CHANG	And why did you do that? He killed my daughter.
CHANG	And why did he do that?
CHANG	How old was she? Fifteen...
CHANG	You knew what she was doing and you did nothing. How else can we make money? Four daughters. No sons. What else could I do? What did you expect me to do? You have to have pity on me. My daughter's just been murdered.
CHANG	This isn't about her. This is about your other three daughters and making sure you don't forget them. I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me. I'll change. I'll be a better man.
CHANG	I know.
VOICE	I set off running to wake from the dream My brother's rifle went into the sheen I kept on running Into the south lands That's where they found me My head in my hands
CHANG	The sheriff he asked me Why I had run And then it came to me Just what I had done And all for no reason Just one piece of lead I hung my head I hung my head.
CHANG	So now that they've caught him... What are they going to do?
KANITA	Put him in jail.
CHANG	Come on. They haven't got a jail big enough. Look at the size of him.
KANITA	Keep him as a pet?
CHANG	But he blew down all their houses. Would you want to keep a pet that could do that?
KANITA	What if they just let him go?
CHANG	How could they be sure he wouldn't do it again?
KANITA	They could ask him...? Very nicely?
CHANG	"And so the king and the fairies that lived in the village said to the creature: this is your mark which will stay with you forever. If you ever try and blow down our village again, it will heat up until it boils your brains, for it has magical properties. Go in peace.
JULIAN	Julian's not here mate. Fuck off...
JULIAN	What is it?
JULIAN	I can't deal with my brother right now...
JULIAN	What?
JULIAN	What happened?
GORDON	They found his body in a hotel room...
GORDON	Look, get dressed and I'll see you downstairs.
MAI	What happened?
JULIAN	Someone killed Billy...
GORDON	What do we do?
JULIAN	For now... We wait.
JULIAN	Hello Mum.
JULIAN	It's me... Julian... Something's happened.
JENNA	I'd like to check in now please.
CONCIERGE	I'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock.
CONCIERGE	... It's policy
JENNA	I'd like to speak to your manager.
CONCIERGE	Yes of course...
MANAGER	Good afternoon madam, what seems to be the problem?
JENNA	Listen to me... I've just travelled six thousand miles to see the corpse of my first born son and I haven't slept for thirty hours and he says I can't go to my room.
MANAGER	I'm sorry madam...
JENNA	How much?
MANAGER	... it simply isn't possible.
JENNA	...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the fucking key...
MANAGER	Well I might be able to arrange something...
JENNA	Don't leave the money there. Some cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
JENNA	Put it in your pocket.
MANAGER	There's really no need--
JENNA	Put it in your fucking pocket.
MANAGER	Room 300.
JENNA	Hey... Open this.
JENNA	I need a drink.
JENNA	Well don't just stand there...
JENNA	I loved him so much you know... Billy...
JENNA	Everyone loves their children don't they? Well, not everyone, but...
JENNA	Do you want to see a picture?
PORTER	Madam. I have to return to my station.
JENNA	What, yeah, thanks.
JULIAN
JULIAN
JULIAN
JULIAN
JULIAN
JENNA	Could it be have been one of the gangs?
JULIAN	Maybe. Take your pick. Billy wasn't popular.
JENNA	What do you mean?
JULIAN	You know Billy... He was eccentric.
JENNA	But you're going to find out who did it, right?
JULIAN	I'll make sure it gets done.
JENNA	No, it needs to be you that does it. We need to show them. Do you understand what I'm saying?
JULIAN	Yeah, okay, I'll do it.
JENNA	Good.
VOICE	Love is a burning thing And it makes a firey ring Bound by wild desire I fell into a ring of fire
CHANG	I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire
CHANG	I fell into a burning ring of fire I went down, down, down And the flames went higher And it burns, burns, burns The Ring of Fire / The Ring of Fire You can't kill me. I'm a cripple. Who are you? What do you think you're doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
JULIAN	Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
CHARLIE LING	Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
JULIAN	Ask him why he killed my brother.
CHARLIE LING	You killed his brother. Big mistake fat man. Why'd you do it? He murdered my daughter.
CHARLIE LING	He says he killed his daughter. Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please. I'll give you anything. Anything you want. My daughters. My shop. Please. I've paid for what I did. Look at me. I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
JULIAN	What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING	He says... He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished already. He told me to do it. Then he took my hand. Look.
JULIAN	Who did that to him? The Angel of Vengeance...
CHARLIE LING	It's a lie - he doesn't exist... I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel of Vengeance.
JULIAN	What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING	He's lying...
JULIAN	Tell me.
CHARLIE LING	It's a story old women tell their grand children... 'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living... restore karma to the world..
JULIAN	How does he do that?
CHARLIE LING	Leads people to their destiny... That's the myth anyway.
JULIAN	Ask him who cut his hand off.
JULIAN	Do it.
CHARLIE LING	Who turned you into a cripple - and no bullshit this time.
CHARLIE LING	He says it was The Angel of Vengeance... The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He finds you.
JULIAN	What's he saying?
CHARLIE LING	Pull yourself together fat man. If you don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat. I'm telling you the truth. He'll find you.
JULIAN	What did he say?
CHARLIE LING	He said you don't find The Angel of Vengeance. He finds you...
GORDON	Are we going to kill him or what?
GORDON	What are you doing?
JULIAN	Nothing... We're not going to do anything... Just leave him. Leave them all.
JENNA	Did you kill him?
JULIAN	It's a little bit more complicated than that Mum.
JENNA	Complicated? He killed my son... What's so fucking complicated about that?
JULIAN	Mum, calm down...
JENNA	Don't tell me to calm down. I want him dead.
JENNA	We don't forgive. Only God does.
JULIAN	I know, you always say that - but this is different...
JENNA	How?
JULIAN	Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...
JENNA	What are you talking about?
JULIAN	...because of what he did.
JENNA	I don't care.
JULIAN	Why?
JENNA	Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered your brother and we're not going to let him get away with it.
JULIAN	What if... What if it was The Angel of Vengeance?
JENNA	The Angel of fucking what...?
JULIAN	...it - or he - restores karma and order in the world.
JENNA	'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things?
JULIAN	He loves all humans...
JENNA	I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill
HIM--
JULIAN	I'm not, I'm just...
JULIAN	... I've got to go.
JENNA	How's business?
GORDON	It's alright, yeah. Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest...
JENNA	What d'you mean?
GORDON	Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. But Billy's not here, is he?
JENNA	I'm here. Julian's here.
JENNA	What's gotten into him...? Is he high or something?
GORDON	I don't know. Earlier today - we had the guy... The guy that killed Billy. Had a gun against his face. But then - nothing...
JENNA	Nothing?
GORDON	Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels... I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him.
JENNA	Not like you...
GORDON	I know how to do what needs to be done. That's all.
JENNA	So tell me... What did he mean when he said it was complicated?
GORDON	There's this other guy... Might have been involved...
JENNA	So we kill them both.
GORDON	We don't know who the other guy is yet...
JENNA	Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know?
MAI	Sorry I'm late.
JULIAN	It's alright...
MAI	What's wrong?
JULIAN	Nothing.
MAI	See anyone you want us to take home tonight?
MAI	What?
JULIAN	Nothing...
MAI	What's with you? You want to get high?
JULIAN	I want you to meet my Mum.
MAI	Is she here?
MAI	D'you want me to?
MAI	Why d'you want me to meet her?
JULIAN	To show her... To show that I've got something here...
MAI	What, like we're a couple?
GORDON	Never come back - you understand me?
GORDON	Good...
GORDON	You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about it. Good luck with that.
JULIAN	When did you last see him?
LIANG'S SISTER	Last night. He went out.
JULIAN	Did he have any enemies?
LIANG'S SISTER	None.
LIANG'S MOTHER	Someone called him.
LIANG'S SISTER	Someone called his mobile.
JULIAN	Who?
LIANG'S SISTER	She doesn't know. They spoke in English.
JULIAN	This his phone?
JULIAN	What is it?
JUILAN	What do they want?
JULIAN	No, I'll talk to them.
JULIAN	Good morning officers. How can I help you?
KIM	We're investigating the murder of Choi Yan Lee.
JULIAN	Never heard of him.
KIM	His arm was cut off. Here.
JULIAN	I run a boxing club. Not much call for one armed men.
JULIAN	What's this got to do with me?
KIM	He was the father of the girl that was found dead with your brother.
JULIAN	Then I guess you boys have got a lot of work to do - so have I, so if you'll excuse me...
KIM	That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If you could just answer our questions.
JULIAN	Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
KIM	Where were you last night?
JULIAN	With my mum...
JULIAN	You want to speak to her?
KIM	That wont be necessary at the moment.
JULIAN	Am I suspect?
CHANG	This is not the man.
JULIAN	I want you to find out who that guy is. Okay?
GORDON	Sure. No problem.
JULIAN	Now.
CHANG	Why are you here?
JULIAN	You're him... Aren't you?
CHANG	Who?
JULIAN	The one who killed my brother.
CHANG	I love all living things.
CHANG	I restore karma. Is that why you came?
JULIAN	I came here to kill you.
CHANG	What's stopping you?
JULIAN	I don't know...
CHANG	Would you like me to tell you?
CHANG	You want the Angel of Vengeance.
JULIAN	Yes.
CHANG	Why?
JULIAN	Cause, all my life... I don't know.
CHANG	Yes you do.
JULIAN	My mother wants me to kill you.
CHANG	And what do you want?
JULIAN	... I love violence.
CHANG	You want to fight me?
JULIAN	Thai style.
KIM	What about his brain?
PHAIBUN	It's a risk... One hit in the wrong place and he'll be straight back in hospital. And maybe he wont be so lucky as last time.
DAENG	Then why's he going to fight the Westerner?
PHAIBUN	He used to be a great boxer.
KIM	He has to do it. Since he came out of the coma, that's what he's done. Whatever's been asked of him, he's done it. He can't help it. It's all a mystery...
DAENG	And if he loses?
PHAIBUN	He can't lose. He's the Angel of Vengeance.
CHANG	View.
NADEE	Window.
CHANG	Table.
NADEE	Do you like the table?
CHANG	Yes. I like the table.
NADEE	What is it?
CHANG	I need to speak to you in Thai.
NADEE	What is it?
CHANG	I love you.
MAI	What is it?
JULIAN	You can't wear that.
MAI	Why not?
JULIAN	My mother's... Very particular about colours.
MAI	You're kidding?
JULIAN	She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else.
JULIAN	Come on.
MAI	This is insane.
JULIAN	Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me.
JENNA	So... May, isn't it?
JULIAN	It's Mai, Mum.
JENNA	How long have you two known each other then?
JULIAN	A year and a half isn't it?
MAI	...that sounds about right.
JENNA	Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends.
JULIAN	Mum, please...
JENNA	So, where did you two meet?
JULIAN	I saw her walking down the street.
JULIAN	And I thought - this is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I just walked up to her and started talking.
JENNA	I hear that happens a lot in this part of the world... Tell me, what's your line of work, Mai?
MAI	I work in the service industry.
JENNA	I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before you started serving my son, how many cocks were you serving? Was it over a thousand?
JENNA	I know girls like you. Just because you might be pulling the wool over my son's eyes don't think it's going to work with me.
JULIAN	Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.
JENNA	I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb isn't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating her and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth.
JULIAN	Leave her alone Mum. You've got her wrong. She's a good girl.
JENNA	What do you know about what's good?
MAI	He's good to me...
JENNA	Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really happy for you--
JULIAN	Mum!
JULIAN	The cops came by my club today.
JULIAN	They're investigating a murder. The guy that killed Billy turned up dead this morning.
JENNA	Oh really, shame that, still, live by the sword, die by the sword...
JULIAN	I know it was you, Mum.
JENNA	I did what had to be done.
JULIAN	He was there. He was with them.
JENNA	Who?
JULIAN	The Angel of Vengeance.
JENNA	D'you kill him?
JULIAN	No.
JENNA	Cause he as good as killed Billy. What I want to know is, what are you going to do about it?
JULIAN	I'm not going to kill him...
JENNA	Yes you are. You're going to do it for me and you're going to do it for your brother.
JULIAN	This isn't about Billy. This is about me. All my life I've been running...
JENNA	That's right you cunt, cause you always run away whenever there's a problem... just like you're running away from killing this fucking Angel of whatever
-
JULIAN	- his name is Chang-
JENNA	Chang?!
MAI	I should be going now.
JENNA	Sit down you cunt.
JULIAN	Mum, don't talk to her like that.
JENNA	So what am I left with?
JULIAN	Me.
JENNA	You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too.
JULIAN	Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it.
JENNA	That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... Do you hear me?
JULIAN	Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me--
JULIAN	-- So you sent him to me and what could I do?
JENNA	You could have protected him.
JULIAN	I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did.
JENNA	I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him.
JULIAN	And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.
JENNA	Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then.
JULIAN	I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
JULIAN	I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way...
JENNA	You would've been a great fighter... You could've gone pro.
JULIAN	Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling.
JULIAN	It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs.
JENNA	At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me.
JULIAN	That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you...
JULIAN	...that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient.
JULIAN	Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed.
JULIAN	I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why?
JENNA	Surprise me.
JULIAN	'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him.
JENNA	Well that seems sensible... And what do you hope that's going to achieve?
JULIAN	I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you.
JENNA	And when you lose, what's going to happen then?
JULIAN	I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
JENNA	Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue.
JULIAN	You never did, Mum.
JENNA	I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you.
JENNA	Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon.
MAI	Are you alright?
JULIAN	I'm fine.
JULIAN	I'll be fine. In a minute.
JULIAN	Sorry about that.
GORDON	Nice evening?
JENNA	Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you know.
JENNA	You're a piece of work, aren't you?
JENNA	No fucking hanging about with you, is there?
GORDON	Well, I don't know about that. Just been out here a while... Know how to get things done.
JENNA	I bet you do.
GORDON	But things are going to shit. Since Billy died, Julian's all over the place...
JENNA	We'll have to something about that the, wont we? But, first things first, what about Chang?
GORDON	Who?
JENNA	My son's guardian angel.
GORDON	He's just a retired cop...
JENNA	Good, then he won't be to hard to kill, will he?
GORDON	It's not that simple... Is there somewhere we can go that's a little more private?
JENNA	What did you have in mind?
GORDON	You can't just going round killing cops here anymore. It's not that easy.
JENNA	I didn't say it was easy. But then, you're a resourceful man, aren't you?
GORDON	I looked into it. Chang's a hard man to get to. None of the Thais'll go near him...
JENNA	Well then you're going to have to find someone who's not a fucking Thai then, aren't you?
GORDON	There might be a way... But Julian can't find out...
JENNA	Don't you worry about that. There are certain things that a mother and son shouldn't - and don't - discuss...
MAI	What are you doing?
JULIAN	Seeing when it hurts.
MAI	I'm going to go.
JULIAN	Didn't you like what I got you?
MAI	It's fine, but you know... It's not my style.
JULIAN	What do you mean?
MAI	Maybe you should give it to your mother.
JULIAN	Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy.
MAI	Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch.
JULIAN	Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me.
MAI	The way she talks to you --
JULIAN	Don't go there.
MAI	What? 'Don't talk about my mother'? Come on Julian.
MAI	Why don't you fuck her instead of me?
JULIAN	You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much.
MAI	You're fucked.
JULIAN	How much do I owe you?
MAI	Fuck you.
YURI KARKOV	... so why do you want to kill a policeman? Policemen are good. They mind their own business and keep the streets safe. Stop people stealing my cars...
JENNA	You really want to know?
YURI KARKOV	Yes. It may effect the price.
JENNA	He killed my son.
YURI KARKOV	Revenge. Pricey...
JENNA	This is Bangkok. Nothing's that expensive.
YURI KARKOV	You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap.
CHANG	Do you want to die? Do you want me to kill you? For what you've done? No. Please. Don't kill me.
CHANG	Tell me why not. Tell me why I shouldn't shoot you as soon as you come out of that door. I'm sorry?
CHANG	Not good enough. It's my first time. I've never done anything like this before.
CHANG	I know that. You're wearing sandals. Hitmen don't wear sandals.
CHANG	Give me a reason.
GUNMAN THREE	I'm begging you. Please--
CHANG	You showed no mercy in there. Why should mercy be shown to you?
GUNMAN THREE	I don't know...
CHANG	Yes you do.
GUNMAN THREE	I don't know his name.
CHANG	But you know where he is.
CHANG	You know why we're here.
LI PO	Yes...
GUNMAN THREE	He set it up. He knows who ordered the hit. He'll tell you.
CHANG	Don't talk unless I ask you to. Understood?
GUNMAN THREE	Yes. Completely understood.
CHANG	Do you have anything to say for yourself?
LI PO	I'm a salesman. Some of the things I sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll give you the man that hired the hit...
CHANG	Good...
LI PO	As for myself, I'm not scared of paying for what I've done. I just... just don't hurt my son.
GUNMAN THREE	You see? He knows. He's got the details. I told you he would.
CHANG	And I told you not to talk unless I asked you.
GUNMAN THREE	Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd let me live.
CHANG	I never said that.
CHANG	This him?
CHANG	Where do I find him?
LI PO	Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every night.
CHANG	I'm taking your phone.
LI PO	What about me?
CHANG	I forgive you...
YURI	You better have a fucking good reason for doing this. Don't you know who you're fucking with.
CHANG	You live in my country. Can't speak my language... Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today.
YURI	Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy's trying to say...
CHANG	Can you turn the music off. It won't be long, I promise.
CHANG	That's better. Thank you very much...
CHANG	You're under arrest...
CHANG	I need information.
CHANG	And you're going to help me.
CHANG	Whether you like it or not.
DIMITRI	It was an English woman - she wanted you dead...
CHANG	Why?
DIMITRI	Said you... murdered her son....
CHANG	Who was she?
DIMITRI	I don't know...
CHANG	How did she know me?
DIMITRI	She asked for you by name...
CHANG	And what's my name?
DIMITRI
CHANG--
CHANG	I see the way you look at my people. The way you abuse them with your eyes. For this, I take your sight.
CHANG	You live in my country, but you fail to learn our language. You don't even try. For this I take your tongue...
CHANG	You had opportunities. You could have chosen other paths... But you wouldn't listen... For this I give you silence...
NADEE	I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you've dreamed of... And I wish you, joy and happiness.
CHANG	But above all this, I wish you love. And I will always love you.
REFEREE	Fight.
JULIAN	Come on.
REFEREE	Break.
KIM	Get up. Please get up.
CHANG	It wasn't you, was it?
CHANG	You're innocent.
JULIAN	What are you talking about?
CHANG	It's not your fault.
JENNA	He doesn't want to see anyone.
JENNA	Just give him time...
MAI	...tell him I came?
JENNA	Of course.
JENNA	We'll get him through this together.
JENNA	You deserved to win. You should've
WON--
JULIAN	Give it a break mum. Just... give it as rest.
JENNA	I'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win.
JULIAN	Yeah, well I lost.
JENNA	And did it make a difference?
JENNA	I want to know... Did it make a difference?
JULIAN	... No... it didn't make a difference... No difference at all.
JENNA	And how do you feel now?
JULIAN	Nothing. I don't feel anything at all.
JENNA	Don't you see, that's how I felt when Billy died...
JULIAN	What do you want, Mum?
JENNA	What d'you think I want? I want it to be like it used to be... I don't want to lose you...
JULIAN	What's wrong Mum?
JULIAN	What's wrong?
JENNA	He knows... He knows it was me.
JULIAN	Who does?
JULIAN	Chang?
JULIAN	What did you do, Mum? What did you do?
JENNA	He's going to come after me. And after he's come after me, he's going to come after you.
JENNA	I'm scared, Julian.
JENNA	What are we going to do?
JULIAN	We'll be okay - I'll do it, I'll take him out...
JENNA	Not just him. We've got to take them all out.
JENNA	Kill them all. The final solution.
CHANG	What happened to the princess' head?
KANITA	The monsters were angry. They bit it off.
CHANG	I thought the King banished them all from his kingdom?
KANITA	These were new monsters. The woods are full of them.
KANITA	What's wrong Dad?
CHANG	Nothing's wrong. Go to sleep.
CHANG	They're going to come after me... Okay. Good.
CHANG	Hello...
VOICE	She is in her room...
CHANG	You sure it's her?
VOICE	Yes...
CHANG	Good... see you very soon.
CHANG	What's your name?
LI HOM	Li Hom.
CHANG	Listen Li Hom. You see anyone you don't like... You call me, okay?
LI HOM	And by the way... Congratulations. Last night. Everyone in the station's talking about it.
JULIAN	We're outside.
JULIAN	I need you here. Right now.
JULIAN	Okay.
JULIAN	Let's make a move.
KIM	They wont disturb us.
CHANG	What floor?
KIM	Top.
JULIAN	What's it say?
CHARLIE LING	"Boxing Cop Hero Back From Grave". One of Bangkok's finest, blah blah blah, came out of a coma that lasted for an entire year, waking up as if nothing had happened... Wife was really happy, blah blah blah... "It's hard to describe" Chang said, "but I do feel different."
JULIAN	The Angel Of Vengeance.
KO SAM	I'm the new guard. Please, go on in.
JENNA	I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed.
KIM	When are you leaving?
JENNA	Tonight.
KIM	And your other son - is he going with you?
JENNA	I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away.
KIM	You watched him fight.
JENNA	I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life.
JENNA	I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer.
JENNA	... It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son... But he hasn't been a son to me.
JENNA	Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home... That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him.
CHANG
HELLO	It's me... Did you change the guard? No.
NADEE	Someone else is out there now...
CHANG	Get out of the apartment...
NADEE	Hold on...
CHANG
NADEE	Kanita - go to your room.
NADEE	... go to your room now.
CHARLIE LING	Wait...
JULIAN	No way.
CHARLIE LING
SHE SAID--
JULIAN	Who said?
JULIAN	My mother?
JULIAN	What kind of a mother says that?
CHARLIE LING	If you've got a problem, talk to her.
JULIAN	No. We're not doing it.
CHARLIE LING	You don't have to. I will.
JULIAN	Only God forgives. And now mother - you will die...
GORDON	Easy...
JULIAN	Where's is she?
GORDON	She's gone... Picked up Billy's body... She's gone home.
GORDON	Didn't she tell you?
GORDON	You alright mate? D'you want something?
JULIAN	I'm so fucked...
GORDON	We're good mates aren't we?
JULIAN	... Yeah.
GORDON	I'm sorry about this Julian. I wish there was another way...
JULIAN	What did she say? What did she promise you?
GORDON	Don't make this harder--
GORDON	You've become a liability. You can see that, can't you?
GORDON	And now she wants me to take over. She wants me to be the favoured son. What am I supposed to say?
GORDON	I didn't want it to end like this. First I fuck your mother. Then I--
CO-WORKER	Mai. Some guy's out there asking for you.
CO-WORKER	Don't forget it's supposed to be my break next.
MAI	What happened to you?
JULIAN	I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave...
JULIAN	... without saying goodbye.
MAI	Who did this to you?
JULIAN	My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me.
MAI	Come with me...
MAI	...to Cambodia - we can hide there... You'll be safe there.
JULIAN	I got about twelve grand at the club... Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear...
MAI	Now?
JULIAN	Right now.
MAI	Wait outside...
MAI	Let's go.
JULIAN	Stay here. If I'm not out in five minutes... Go.
MAI	Five minutes.
CHANG	Let's go.
CHANG	Get up.
CHANG	Get up. Now.
JULIAN	I'm sorry...
CHANG	Do you have anything to say?
JULIAN	Don't hurt her.
CHANG	Do you have anything to say?
JULIAN	I'm sorry...
CHANG	What do you expect me to do?
JULIAN	I don't know... I'm sorry.
CHANG	Come on.
CHANG	When you were born - what's the first thing you remember seeing?
CHANG	What do you remember?
JULIAN	Dark... Darkness.
CHANG	And do you ever see light?
JULIAN	No... Never.
CHANG	I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore order and karma. I love all living things...
CHANG	...I want you to walk away from here now... Do you understand?
CHANG	Good.
CHANG	Go with God.
CHANG	Country roads, take me home to the place I belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads..
YESTERDAY
CHANG	Country roads, take me home to the place I belong West Virginia, mountain momma Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads Take me home, country roads
