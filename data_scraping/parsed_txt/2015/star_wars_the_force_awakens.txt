Star Wars: The Force Awakens

POE	Well, because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.
POE
POE	We've got company.
POE	You have to hide.
POE	Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
POE	I see 'em!
POE	You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me? (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates) I'll come back for you! It will be alright.
SENIOR TROOPER	Stay here.
KYLO REN	Look how old you've become.
KYLO REN	You know what I've come for.
KYLO REN	The map to Skywalker. We know you've found it, and now you're going to give it to the First Order.
KYLO REN	I'll show you the dark side.
KYLO REN	You're so right.
POE	So who talks first? You talk first?
KYLO REN	The old man gave it to you.
POE	It's just very hard to understand you with all the...
KYLO REN	Search him.
POE	... Apparatus.
STORMTROOPER #1	Nothing, sir.
KYLO REN	Put him on board.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	Sir, the villagers.
KYLO REN	Kill them all.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	On my command!
STORMTROOPER #2	Nothing here. Go ahead!
POE	All right. All right!
CAPTAIN PHASMA	FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection.
FN-2187	Yes, Captain.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?
FN-2187	I'm sorry, Captain.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	Report to my division at once.
UNKAR	What you've brought me today is worth... Hmmm... One quarter portion.
WOMAN	Tal'ama parqual!
WOMAN	Parqual zatana!
WOMAN
WOMAN	Shhhh.
WOMAN	That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. (considers BB-8 for the first time,
STRAIGHTENS THE
ANTENNA)	Where do you come from?	Classified. Really? Me too. Big secret. (points to horizon) Niima Outpost is that way, stay off Kelvin Ridge.
WOMAN	Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north, you'll drown in the sand. (stands, heads off)
WOMAN	Don't follow me. Town is that way. (he BEEPS again) No!
WOMAN	In the morning, you go.	You're welcome.
KYLO REN	I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable?
POE	Not really.
KYLO REN	I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.
POE	Might wanna rethink your technique.
KYLO REN	Where is it?
POE	The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.
KYLO REN	Where... is it?
KYLO REN	It's in a droid. A BB unit.
GENERAL HUX	Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.
KYLO REN	I leave that to you.
WOMAN	Don't give up. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting.
WOMAN	For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on.
UNKAR	These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... One half portion.
WOMAN	Last week they were a half portion each.
UNKAR	What about the droid?
WOMAN	What about him?
UNKAR	I'll pay for him.
UNKAR	Sixty portions.
WOMAN	Actually... the droid's not for sale.	Come on.
UNKAR	Follow the girl and get that droid.
STORMTROOPER	Ren wants the prisoner.
STORMTROOPER	Turn here.
STORMTROOPER	Listen carefully: you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.
POE	If -- what--?
FN-2187	This is a rescue, I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
POE	You with the Resistance--?!
FN-2187	What?	No no no! I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
POE	I can fly anything. Why, why are you helping me?
FN-2187	Because it's the right thing to do.
POE	(it hits him) You need a pilot.
FN-2187	I need a pilot.
POE	We're gonna do this.
FN-2187	(unsure but hopeful) ... Yeah?
FN-2187	Okay, stay calm, stay calm.
POE	I am calm.
FN-2187	I'm talking to myself.	Not yet. Okay, go. This way.
POE	I always wanted to fly one of these things. Can ya shoot?
FN-2187	Blasters, I can!
POE	Okay, same principal! Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons, and mag pulse -- use the site on the right to aim, triggers to fire!
FN-2187	This is very complicated
POE	I can fix this.
POE	I got it!
POE	Woooahhh! This thing really moves. All right, we gotta take out as many cannons as we can or we're not gonna get very far!
FN-2187	All right!
POE	I'm gonna get us in position, just stay sharp!
POE	Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I've got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.
FN-2187	Okay, got it.
FN-2187	YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE
POE	I saw it! Hey, what's your name?
FN-2187
POE	FN-whaa?
FN-2187	That's the only name they ever gave me!
POE	Well I ain't using it! FN, huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn! That all right?
FINN	"Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that! I like that!
POE	I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.
FINN	Good to meet you, Poe!
POE	Good to meet you too, Finn!
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--
GENERAL HUX	Use the ventral cannons.
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	Yes, sir. Bringing them online --
GENERAL HUX	Yes, and he had help.	From one of our own.
KYLO REN	... The one from the village. FN-
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	Sir. Ventral cannons hot.
GENERAL HUX	Fire.
POE	One's coming towards you. My right, your left. Do you see it?
FINN	Hold on! I see it!
POE	Nice shot.
FINN	Where are you going?
POE	We're going back to Jakku. That's where.
FINN	No no no! We can't go back to Jakku! We need to get outta this system!
POE	I got to get to my droid before the First Order does!
FINN	What - a droid?!
POE	That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange and white: one of a kind.
FINN	I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!
POE	This one is, pal.
FINN	We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can! We go back to Jakku, we die!
POE	That droid's got a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker!
FINN	Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I--
CAPTAIN PHASMA	FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.
GENERAL HUX	No prior signs of non-conformity?
CAPTAIN PHASMA	This was his first offense.
TECHNICIAN #1	General. They've been hit.
GENERAL HUX	Destroyed?
TECHNICIAN #1	Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku -- the fighter's projected to crash in the Goazon badlands.
GENERAL HUX	They were going back for the droid -- send a squad to the wreckage.
FINN	Poe! Poe!
FINN	Poe!!! POE!
FINN
GENERAL HUX	Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.
KYLO REN	How capable are your soldiers, General?
GENERAL HUX	I won't have you question my methods.
KYLO REN	They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
GENERAL HUX	My men are exceptionally trained -- programmed from birth--
KYLO REN	Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
GENERAL HUX	Careful, Ren. That your "personal interests" not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
KYLO REN	I want that map. For your sake, I suggest you get it.
FINN	Water... water... water..
FINN	-- Awgh, GAH!
WOMAN	(To BB-8) Who? Him?
WOMAN	What's your hurry, thief?
FINN	What--?! Thief?
FINN	OW! HEY! What?!
WOMAN	The jacket! This droid says you stole it!
FINN	I've had a pretty messed up day, alright?! So I'd appreciate it you stop accusing me -- OW!!! (BB-8 has ZAPPED him
AGAIN)
WOMAN	Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master.
FINN	It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?
FINN	He was captured... by the First Order! I helped him escape but our ship crashed.	Poe didn't make it. (sees BB-8 is sad,
ROLLS OFF)	Look, I tried to help him. I'm sorry...
WOMAN	So you're with the Resistance?
FINN	Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with the Resistance, yeah.	I'm with the Resistance.
WOMAN	I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
FINN	Well, this is what we look like. Some of us. Others look different.
WOMAN	BB-8 says he's on a secret mission, he has to get back to your base.
FINN	Apparently he's carrying a map that leads to Luke Skywalker, and everyone's after it.
WOMAN	Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth.
WOMAN	What is it?
WOMAN	(re: her hand) What are you doing?!
FINN	Come on!
FINN	Come on, BB-8!
WOMAN	Let go of me!
FINN	No, we gotta move!
WOMAN	(pulls her hand back) I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way!
STORMTROOPER	Call in the air strike!
WOMAN	They're shooting at both of us!
FINN	Yeah, they saw you with me! You're marked!
WOMAN	Well, thanks for that!
FINN	I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick! Does anyone have blasters around here?!
WOMAN	Are you okay?
WOMAN	Stop taking my hand!
WOMAN	Hey!
FINN	-- Are you okay?
WOMAN	Yeah. (extends her hand) Follow me.
FINN	We can't outrun them!
WOMAN	We might in that quad-jumper!
FINN	We need a pilot!
WOMAN	We've got one!
FINN	You?! (then, indicates one
OFF-CAMERA)	What about that ship?
WOMAN	That one's garbage!
WOMAN	The garbage'll do!
WOMAN	Gunner position's down there!
FINN	Y'ever fly this thing?
WOMAN	No! This ship hasn't been flown in years!
FINN	Great. (reacts to seat) Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--
WOMAN	I can do this, I can do this--
UNKAR
FINN	Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay low!
WOMAN
FINN	Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
WOMAN	BB-8, hold on!
WOMAN
WOMAN	What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?!
FINN	I'm working on it! Are the shields up?
WOMAN	Not so easy without a co-pilot!
FINN	Try sitting in this thing!
FINN	We need cover, quick!
WOMAN	We're about to get some!	I hope.
FINN	Damn it!
FINN	Come on... come on...
WOMAN	Nice shot!
FINN	I'm getting pretty good at this!
FINN	The cannon's stuck in forward position, I can't move it! You gotta lose 'em!
WOMAN	Get ready!
FINN	Okay! For what?
FINN
WOMAN	Oh no!
FINN	Whooo!
WOMAN	You're ok. He's with the Resistance. He's going to get you home. We both will.	I don't know your name.
FINN	Finn. What's yours.
WOMAN	I'm Rey.
FINN	Rey...
WOMAN	Help me with this! Quick!
FINN	Whoa! What's going on?
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	Sir. We were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.
KYLO REN	The droid... stole a freighter?
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	Not exactly, sir. It had help.
KYLO REN	Anything else?
LIEUTENANT MITAKA	The two were accompanied by a girl.
KYLO REN	What girl?
WOMAN	It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris wrench -- check in there!
FINN	How bad is it?!
WOMAN	If we wanna live, not good!
FINN	They're hunting for us now, we gotta get outta this system!
WOMAN	BB-8 said the location of the Resistance Base is "need to know" -- if I'm taking you there, I need to know!
FINN	(Throws a tool) This?
FINN	You gotta tell us where the base is.	I don't speak that. Alright, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay? (BB-8 backs up) -- I'm just trying to get away from the First Order -- but you tell us where your base is, I'll get there first -- deal?! (BB-8 COCKS his head) Droid, please.
WOMAN	Pilex driver, hurry!
WOMAN	So where's your base?
FINN	(searching, to BB-8) Go on BB-8, tell her.	Please!
WOMAN	The Ileenium system?
FINN	Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's the one -- get us there as fast as you can.
WOMAN	I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape, hurry!
FINN	(searching for tape) What about you?
WOMAN	I gotta get back to Jakku!
FINN	(loses his mind) BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone always wanna go back to Jakku?! !
WOMAN	No, that one! No. No. The one I'm pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we don't patch it up, the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas!
FINN	This?
WOMAN	Yes!
FINN	Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you can fly anywhere! Why go back?! You got a family? You got a boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?
WOMAN	None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
FINN	... That can't be good.
WOMAN	-- No it can't be --
WOMAN	Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden.
WOMAN	Get off. Get off! See anything?
FINN	... Oh no.
FINN	It's the First Order.
WOMAN	What do we do-- there must be
FINN	You said poisonous gas --
WOMAN	-- Yeah, but I fixed that --
FINN	Can you unfix it?
WOMAN	C'mon BB-8.
FINN	I got it.
WOMAN	Oooh...
FINN	I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...
WOMAN	You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers?
FINN	Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins.
FINN	Hurry!
WOMAN	I'm hurrying!
HAN	Chewie, we're home.
HAN	Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
WOMAN	...I'm the pilot...
HAN	You?
WOMAN	No, it's true: we're the only ones on board.
FINN	You can understand that thing?
HAN	And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there.
HAN	Where'd you get this ship?
WOMAN	Niima Outpost.
HAN	Jakku?! That junkyard?
FINN	Thank you! Junkyard!
HAN	Told ya we should've double-checked the Western Reaches!	Who had it, Ducain?
WOMAN	I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.
HAN	Who stole it from me! Well, you tell him Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.
WOMAN	This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?
HAN	I used to be.
FINN	Han Solo? The Rebellion General?
WOMAN	No, the smuggler!
FINN	Wasn't he a war hero?!
WOMAN	This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in fourteen parsecs...!
HAN	Twelve! Fourteen.
HAN	Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line!
WOMAN	Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a mistake too, puts too much stress on
HAN	-- Stress on the hyperdrive-- (who is she? Then:) Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.
WOMAN	Wait! No -- we need your help!
HAN	My help?
WOMAN	This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible!
FINN	He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.
FINN	You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him.
HAN	Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
HAN	Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten
FINN	Wait -- a what?! Did you just say Rathtars? Hey!
FINN	You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?
HAN	I'm hauling Rathtars.
HAN	Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang -- they must've tracked us from Nantoon.
WOMAN	What's a Rathtar?
FINN	Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!
WOMAN	No.
FINN	Good.
HAN	I got three of 'em going to King Prana.
FINN	THREE?! How'd you get them on board?
HAN	I used to have a bigger crew.
HAN	Get below deck and stay there until I say so -- don't even think about taking the Falcon.
WOMAN	What about BB-8?
HAN	He stays with me -- until I get rid of the gang, then you can have him back and be on your way.
FINN	What about the Rathtars... where are you keeping them?
HAN	There's one.
WOMAN	What are you gonna do?
HAN	Same thing I always do: talk my way out of it.	Yes, I do. Every time.
BALA-TIK	Han Solo. You are a dead man.
HAN	Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
BALA-TIK	The problem is we loaned you fifty thousand for this job.
WOMAN	Can you see them?
FINN	No.
BALA-TIK	I heard you also borrowed fifty thousand from Kanjiklub.
HAN	You know you can't trust those little freaks! How long've we known each other?
WOMAN	They have blasters...
FINN	A lot of 'em.
BALA-TIK	The question is how much longer will we know each other? Not long. We want our money back now.
HAN	Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
BALA-TIK	Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.
HAN	I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
BALA-TIK	Tell that to Kanjiklub.
HAN	Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
TASU LEECH	Wrong again, Solo. It's over for you.
HAN	Boys. You're both gonna get what I promised! Have I ever not delivered for you before?
BALA-TIK	Yeah.
TASU LEECH	Twice!
HAN	What was the second time?
BALA-TIK	Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.
TASU LEECH	Nowhere left for you to hide.
BALA-TIK	That BB unit... the First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives.
HAN	First I've heard of it.
RAZOO QIN-FEE	Search the freighter.
WOMAN	Wait wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor, we can trap both gangs!
FINN	Close the blast doors from here?
WOMAN	Resetting the fuses should do it.
HAN	... I got a bad feeling about this...
WOMAN	Oh no.
FINN	Oh no, what?
WOMAN	Wrong fuses.
BALA-TIK	Kill them! And take the droid!
FINN	This was a mistake!
WOMAN	Huge!
WOMAN	What do they look like?
FINN	They look like that.
FINN	This way!
WOMAN	Are you sure?
WOMAN
FINN
WOMAN
WOMAN	Finn!
FINN	It had me! But the door--!
WOMAN	That was lucky!
HAN	I got the door. Cover us!
HAN	Chewie! You okay?
HAN	(looks at bowcaster) Wow. Come on! Come on!
WOMAN	Han!
HAN	You, close the door behind us!	You take care of Chewie!
HAN	Hey, where are you going?
WOMAN	Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too -- if we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
HAN	I hate that guy.
WOMAN	And you could use a co-pilot.
HAN	I got one, he's back there.
HAN	Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of here at lightspeed --
WOMAN	From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?
HAN	I never ask that question until after I've done it.
HAN	This is not how I thought this day was gonna go -- angle the shields -- Hang on back there!
FINN	No problem!
HAN	Come on baby, don't let me down!
HAN	What?!
WOMAN	Compressor.
BALA-TIK	Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
SNOKE	... Leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi will rise.
GENERAL HUX	Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility for th--
SNOKE	General! Our strategy must now change.
GENERAL HUX	The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it. We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance, the Republic. Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable, and we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.
SNOKE	Go. Oversee preparations.
GENERAL HUX	Yes, Supreme Leader.
SNOKE	There's been an awakening. Have you felt it?
KYLO REN	Yes.
SNOKE	There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father, Han Solo.
KYLO REN	He means nothing to me.
SNOKE	Even you, master of the Knights of Ren, have never faced such a test.
KYLO REN	By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.
SNOKE	We shall see. We shall see.
HAN	Electrical overload!
WOMAN	I can fix that!
HAN	The coolant's leaking!
WOMAN	Try transferring auxiliary power to the secondary tank--
HAN	-- Secondary tank, I got it!
FINN	Chewie, come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!
HAN	You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!
FINN	Hurt him?! He almost killed me six times! (Chewie GRABS HIM by the collar, ROARS) Which is fine.
HAN	This hyperdrive blows there's gonna be pieces of us in three different systems.
HAN	What'd you do?
WOMAN	I by-passed the compressor.
HAN	Move, Ball.
HAN	Nah, don't say that, you did great. Just rest.
HAN	Good job, kid. And thanks.
FINN	You're welcome.
HAN	So, fugitives, huh?
WOMAN	The First Order wants the map.
WOMAN	(re: Finn and BB-8) Finn is with the Resistance...	... I'm just a scavenger.
HAN	Let's see whatcha got.
WOMAN	Go ahead.
HAN	This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared, people have been looking for him.
WOMAN	Why'd he leave?
HAN	He was training a new generation of Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned against him, destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible... He walked away from everything.
FINN	Do you know what happened to him?
HAN	There're a lot of rumors. Stories. The people who knew him the best think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
WOMAN	The Jedi were real?
HAN	I used to wonder that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo -- magical power holding together good, evil, the dark side and the light.	'Crazy thing is, it's true. The Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's all true.
HAN	No, you rest. (To Rey and Finn) You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.
WOMAN	... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy...
FINN	Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're walking into here --
HAN	D'you just call me "Solo"?
FINN	Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance. Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? First Order sympathizers?
HAN	Listen big deal, you've got another problem. Women always figure out the truth.
HAN	Always.
HAN	You might need this.
WOMAN	I think I can handle myself.
HAN	I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it.
HAN	You know how to use one of these?
WOMAN	Yeah, you pull the trigger.
HAN	There's a little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
WOMAN	Rey.
HAN	Rey. I've been thinkin' about bringing on some more crew, Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, appreciates the Falcon.
WOMAN	Are you offering me a job?
HAN	I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't pay much.
WOMAN	You're offering me a job.
HAN	I'm thinking about it.
HAN	Well?
WOMAN	If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.
HAN	Jakku?
WOMAN	I've already been away too long.
HAN	Chewie, check out the ship as best you can.
HAN	It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.
FINN	Solo, why are we here again?
HAN	To get your droid on a clean ship.
WOMAN	Clean?
HAN	Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon? If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order's not far behind. Want to get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata is our best bet.
FINN	We can trust her, right?
HAN	Relax, kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking. And whatever you do, don't stare...
HAN	Any of it.
MAZ	Han Solo!
HAN	(Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving) Hey, Maz!
MAZ	Where's my boyfriend?
HAN	Chewie's working on the Falcon.
MAZ	I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.
GA-97	Alert the Resistance. Their missing droid is here!
BAZINE	Inform the First Order... I've found the droid.
KYLO REN	Forgive me. I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again, the power of the darkness, and I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me, Grandfather, and I will finish what you started.
MAZ	A map to Skywalker himself? You're right back in the mess.
HAN	Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.
MAZ	Hmm. No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han, nyakee nago wadda. Go home!
HAN	Leia doesn't want to see me.
FINN	Please, we came here for your help.
WOMAN	What fight?
MAZ	The only fight: against the dark side. Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today, it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.
FINN	There is no fight against the First Order! Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right--
FINN	What's this? What are you doing?
FINN	Solo, what is she doing?
HAN	I don't know, but it ain't good.
MAZ	If you live long enough you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
FINN	(eyes on Maz) You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. What I've seen.
FINN	You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.
MAZ	You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim. There, you can disappear.
WOMAN	Finn!
FINN	Come with me.
WOMAN	What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
FINN	I can't.
HAN	Keep it, kid.
MAZ	Who's the girl?
FINN	I was told you could get me to the Outer Rim.
WOMAN	What are you doing?
FINN	(to Big Head) Don't leave without me.
WOMAN	You can't just go. I won't let you.
FINN	I'm not who you think I am.
WOMAN	Finn, what are you talking about?
FINN	I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a Stormtrooper.	Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing...	But my first battle, I made a choice. I wasn't going to kill for them. So I ran.
FINN	Right into you. And you looked at me like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey, come with me.
WOMAN	Don't go.
FINN	Take care of yourself. Please.
YOUNG GIRL
YOUNG GIRL	No, come back!
UNKAR PLUTT	Quiet, girl!
WOMAN	What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
MAZ	That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him and now, it calls to you!
WOMAN	I have to get back to Jakku.
MAZ	Han told me. (reaches out, hold
WOMAN'S HAND)	Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku, they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could.
WOMAN	Luke.
MAZ	The belonging you seek is not behind you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi, but I know the Force. It moves through and surrounds every living thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.
MAZ	The light. It's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it.
WOMAN	I'm never touching that again. I don't want any part of this.
GENERAL HUX	Today is the end of the Republic! The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder! At this very moment, in a system far from here the New Republic LIES to the GALAXY while secretly supporting the treachery of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built, upon which we stand, will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet! All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this... as the last day of the Republic!
GENERAL HUX
FINN	The First Order, they've done it. Where's Rey?
WOMAN	What are you doing?	You have to go back. (he BEEPS again)
WOMAN	BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to go back, you're too important. They'll help you.
MAZ	I've had this for ages...
MAZ	Kept it locked away.
HAN	Where'd you get that?
MAZ	A good question for another time.	Take it! Find your friend!
MAZ	Those beasts! They're here!
STORMTROOPER	FN-417, hold position!
WOMAN	Safety!
STORMTROOPER #4	Sir, the droid was spotted heading west, with a girl.
WOMAN	You have to keep going, stay out of sight, I'll try to fight 'em off. (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely through her fear) I hope so, too.
HAN	Come on, Chewie!
MAZ	Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now go.
FINN	I need a weapon.
MAZ	You have one!
HAN	Hey, can I try that?
HAN	I like this thing.
STORMTROOPER	Traitor!
HAN	You okay, Big deal?
FINN	Thanks!
STORMTROOPER	Don't move! TK-338, we have targets in custody!
STORMTROOPER	We have incoming at two-eight-point- six! Move! Dispatch! Move! Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble all squads! Anti-air cover en route to our position!
HAN	It's the Resistance.
POE	Go straight ahead and don't let these dogs scare you!
HAN	Quick!
FINN	Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva pilot!
POE
KYLO REN	The girl I've heard so much about.
STORMTROOPER	Request air support!
KYLO REN	The map. You've seen it.
STORMTROOPER #5	Sir, Resistance fighters! We need more troops.
KYLO REN	Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need.
STORMTROOPER	Pull back the tree line!
FINN
FINN	No, no, no, no... WOMAN!!
FINN	He took her! Did you see that? He took her. She's gone!
HAN	Yeah, yeah, I know...
C-3PO	Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! (sees Han, stops) You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. (sees Leia,
INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)	Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.	Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled.
HAN	You changed your hair.
LEIA	Same jacket.
HAN	No, new jacket.
HAN	... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son. He was here.
FINN	Poe. Poe Dameron.
FINN	You're alive!
POE	So are you!
FINN	What happened to you?
POE	What happened? I got thrown from the crash, woke up at night -- no you, no ship, nothing--
POE	BB-8 says that you saved him.
FINN	No, no, no. It wasn't just me.
POE	You completed my mission, Finn. That's my jacket?
FINN	Oh here.
POE	No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man, Finn.
FINN	Poe -- I need your help.
POE	General Organa. Sorry to interrupt, this is Finn, he needs to talk to
LEIA	(takes Finn's hand) And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave, what you did. Renouncing the First Order, saving this man's life --
FINN	(surprised she knows) Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of mine was taken prisoner--
LEIA	Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
POE	Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
LEIA	We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
FINN	That's where my friend was taken -- I've got to get there, fast.
LEIA	And I will do everything I can to help, but first you must tell us all you know.	That sounds very scary.	You must be so brave.
C-3PO	General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
LEIA	I can't believe I was so foolish to think that I could just find Luke and bring him home.
HAN	Leia...
LEIA	Don't do that.
HAN	Do what? She heads off.
LEIA	Anything. Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.
C-3PO	Princesses.
HAN	I'm trying to be helpful!
LEIA	When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
HAN	I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly, he may never be his old self again.
HAN	Listen to me, will you? I know every time you... every time you look at me, you're reminded of him.
LEIA	You think I want to forget him? I want him back!
HAN	There was nothing we could've done. (hard for him to say) There was too much Vader in him.
LEIA	That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
HAN	We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever good at.
LEIA	We both did.
HAN	We lost our son, forever.
LEIA	No.	It was Snoke.
LEIA	He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
HAN	If Luke couldn't reach him, how could
LEIA	Luke is a Jedi... you're his father. There's still light in him. I know it.
GENERAL STATURA	General, the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
WOMAN	Where am I?
KYLO REN	You're my guest.
WOMAN	Where are the others?
KYLO REN	You mean the murderers, traitors and thieves you call friends? (Rey stares at him) You'll be relieved to hear that I have no idea.
WOMAN	That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.
KYLO REN	Tell me about the droid.
WOMAN	(a nervous beat) He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --
KYLO REN	He's carrying a section of a navigational chart. We have the rest, recovered from archives of the Empire. We need the last piece. And somehow, you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
WOMAN	-- Get out of my head --
KYLO REN	I know you've seen the map. It's in there... and now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.
WOMAN	I'm not giving you anything.
KYLO REN	We'll see.
WOMAN	... You... you're afraid... that you will never be as strong as... Darth Vader!
KYLO REN	She's strong with the Force, untrained but, stronger than she knows.
SNOKE	And the droid?
SNOKE	Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.
GENERAL HUX	We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.
SNOKE	Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon.
KYLO REN	Supreme Leader. I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.
SNOKE	If what you say about this girl is true, bring her to me.
WOMAN	You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
TROOPER GUARD #2	What did you say?
WOMAN	You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
TROOPER GUARD #2	I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum!
WOMAN	You will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
TROOPER GUARD #2	I will remove these restraints. And leave this cell, with the door open.
WOMAN	And you will drop your weapon.
TROOPER GUARD #2	And I'll drop my weapon.
KYLO REN
GENERAL HUX	Begin charging the weapon!
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN	Yes, sir. Weapon charging.
POE	The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.
SNAP	They've somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
BRANCE	A laser cannon?
SNAP	We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
MAJOR EMATT	It's another Death Star.
POE	I wish that were the case, Major.
POE	This was the Death Star.
POE	This is Starkiller Base.
HAN	So it's big.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR	How is it possible to power a weapon of this size?
FINN	It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged, the sun is drained until it disappears.
LEIA	(eyes on datacard) The First Order: they're charging the weapon again, now. (then, heart sinking) Our system is the next target.
C-3PO	Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.
HAN	Okay, how do we blow it up? (all eyes on him) There's always a way to do that.
LEIA	Han's right.
ADMIRAL STATURA	(at first hesitant) In order for that amount of power to be contained, that base would need some kind of thermal oscillator...
FINN	There is one.
FINN	Precinct 47. Here.
ADMIRAL STATURA	If we can destroy that oscillator, it might de-stabilize the core and cripple the weapon.
MAJOR EMATT	... Maybe the planet.
POE	We'll go in there and we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR	They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
HAN	We disable the shields.	Kid, you worked there, what do you got?
FINN	(beat, then:) I can do it.
HAN	I like this guy.
FINN	I can disable the shields. But I have to be there, on the planet--
HAN	We'll get you there.
LEIA	Han, how?
HAN	If I told you, you wouldn't like it.
POE	So we disable the shields, take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go!
HAN	Chewie, check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be careful with those - they're explosives.
FINN	Now you tell me?
LEIA	No matter how much we fought, I've always hated watching you leave.
HAN	That's what I did it. So you'd miss me.
LEIA	I did miss you.
HAN	It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh? Some of it was...good.
LEIA	... Pretty good.
HAN	Some things never change.
LEIA	True. You still drive me crazy.
LEIA	If you see our son again, bring him home.
STORMTROOPER	Sir, sensors triggered in hangar 718. We're searching the area.
KYLO REN	She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes.
FINN	How are we getting in?
HAN	Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.
FINN	We're gonna make our landing approach at lightspeed?!
HAN	Alright, Chewie, get ready.
HAN	And Now!
HAN
HAN	I get any higher, they'll see us!
OFFICER	Sir, she was not found in hangar 718 but all troops are on alert.
KYLO REN	Put every hangar on lock-down. She's going to try to steal a ship to--
FINN	The flooding tunnels are over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
HAN	What was your job when you were based here?
FINN	Sanitation.
HAN	Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
FINN	I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
HAN	People are counting on us! The galaxy is counting on us--!
FINN	Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll use the Force!
HAN	That's not how the Force works--!
HAN	Oh really, you're cold?
FINN	Come on!
GENERAL HUX	Report.
STORMTROOPER FN-9330	Hey!
HAN	The longer we're here, less luck we're going to have. The shields?
FINN	I have an idea about that.
FINN	Remember me?
CAPTAIN PHASMA
FINN	Not anymore. The name's Finn, and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.
HAN	Bring it down. Bring it down.
FINN	Follow me.
FINN	You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	You're making a big mistake.
FINN	Do it.
FINN	Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.
HAN	Don't worry kid, we won't leave here without her.
CAPTAIN PHASMA	(to Finn, cruel) You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
FINN	I disagree. What do we do with her?
HAN	Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
FINN	Yeah, there is...
OFFICER	General, their shields are down!
C-3PO	Thank the Maker!
LEIA	Han did it! Send them in!
ADMIRAL STATURA	Give Poe full authorization to attack.
REAR ADMIRAL
GULCH	Black Leader, go to sub-lights. On your call.
POE	Roger, base -- red squad, blue squad, take my lead.
YOLO ZIFF	Dropping out of lightspeed.
POE	Almost in range! Hit the target dead center, as many runs as we can get!
SNAP	Approaching target.
GENERAL HUX	Dispatch all squadrons...
COLONEL DATOO	Yes, General.
POE	Let's light it up!
ELLO ASTY	But no damage!
POE	Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it! Another bombing run! Remember, when that sun is gone, that weapon will be ready to fire! But as long as there's light, we got a chance.
POE	Guys, we got a lot of company!
FINN	We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.
HAN	You sure you're up for this?
FINN	Hell no -- I'll go in find and try to find Rey -- (improvising, fast) -- The troopers'll be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that'll leads -- (Han starts pointing with his chin to
SOMETHING BEHIND
FINN)	Why are you doing that? Why are you doing -- this? I'm trying to come up with a plan.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR	The Oscillator's still standing.
OFFICER	X-wings coming back for another round of attacks!
HAN	Are you all right?
WOMAN	Yeah.
HAN	Good.
FINN	What happened -- did he hurt you?
WOMAN	Finn. What are you doing here?!
FINN	We came back for you.
FINN	What'd he say?
WOMAN	(shrugs, smiles, though nearly in tears) ... That it was your idea.
WOMAN	Thank you.
FINN	How did you get away?
WOMAN	I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
HAN	Escape now. Hug later.
SNAP	I got one behind me. See it?
JESS	Yeah, I'm on it!
JESS	Furillo's been hit!
SNAP	Watch out for ground fire!
HAN	They're in trouble. We can't leave. (to Finn, re: Chewie) My friend here has a bag full of explosives. Let's use 'em.
VOBER DAND	Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
C-3PO	And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
HAN	That girl knows her stuff.
HAN	We'll set the charges at every other column.
HAN	You're right. That's a better idea. (checks his detonator) You take the top.	I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here.
KYLO REN	Find them.
HAN	Ben!
KYLO REN	Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
HAN	Take off that mask. You don't need it.
KYLO REN	What do you think you'll see if I do?
HAN	The face of my son.
KYLO REN	Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish, like his father. So I destroyed him.
HAN	That's what Snoke wants you to believe but it's not true. My son is alive.
KYLO REN	No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
HAN	Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you -- you know it's true.
KYLO REN	It's too late.
HAN	No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
KYLO REN	I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain.
KYLO REN	I know what I have to do, but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
HAN	Yes. Anything.
KYLO REN	Thank you.
FINN	Solo.
WOMAN	No, no.
ADMIRAL ACKBAR	The Oscillator's been damaged but is still functional.
FINN	The Falcon's this way.
KYLO REN	We're not done yet.
WOMAN	You're a monster!
KYLO REN	It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.
FINN	Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh no no no...
KYLO REN
FINN	Come get it.
NIV LEK	We just lost R-1!
JESS	We're overwhelmed! What do we do? It isn't working!
YOLO ZIFF	Black Leader, there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in!
POE	Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!
ELLO ASTY	Roger!
POE	Everybody else, hit the target hard! Give it everything you got!
POE	I need some help here! I need some help!
JESS	Watch out!
ELLO ASTY	I'm hit!
POE	All teams - I'm going in! Pull up and cover me!
NIV LEK	Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck, Poe!
STARKILLER TECHNICIAN	Weapon at full capacity in thirty seconds.
GENERAL HUX	Prepare to fire.
KYLO REN	You need a teacher! I can show you the ways of the Force!
WOMAN	The Force.
COLONEL DATOO	Lieutenant, get back to your station!
YOUNG TECHNICIAN	(stops, fleetingly) Just look. We won't survive -- even Hux has gone!
GENERAL HUX	The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun.
SNOKE	Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren.	It is time to complete his training.
WOMAN	Finn! Finn...
POE	All teams! I got eyes on them!
SNAP	Yes!
POE	Our job's done here. Let's go home!
MEDIC	Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat.
C-3PO	R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that!
CONTINUES BEEPING)	Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once!
LEIA	Tell me.
POE	Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
C-3PO	Oh! The map! It is complete!
LEIA	(hand on her heart) -- Luke --
C-3PO	(to R2-D2) Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you.
WOMAN	We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you, my friend.
LEIA	Rey.
LEIA	May the Force be with you.
