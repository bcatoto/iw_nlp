A Most Violent Year

JULIAN	Good morning.
ABEL	Ready?
ANNA	Yes.
ABEL	You look very nice.
ANNA	Thank you.
ABEL	You sure?
ANNA	Yes.
ANNA	Don't do anything stupid.
ABEL	We don't have any more money so what else could I do.
ANDREW WALSH	So how are we this morning?
ABEL	(gives a smile and nod)
ANDREW WALSH	Well I woke up feeling very good about this.
ABEL	Really?
ABEL	You've been telling me not to do this for a year.
ANDREW WALSH	Well we are going all in... so now I love it.
JOSEPH	So why is it you want this land?
ABEL	I'm sorry?
JOSEPH	It has been difficult for you to get me here, no? Over a year?
ABEL	Almost two.
JOSEPH	There are many like it around? And thanks to all these tests you paid for, we now know it is as much of a mess below the ground as it is above. My people have looked at your books, I know this is a lot of money for you, so why have you kept on us so... just for this ugly and polluted little piece of the earth.
ABEL	I have been looking over my fence at this property for a very long time.
JOSEPH	So it is just proximity?
ABEL	No... I imagine I want it for the same reason you did.
JOSEPH	And what's that?
ABEL	To grow.
JOSEPH	Well, I am in the garment business so I appreciate that sentiment. But I inherited this land from my uncle. Sadly he had no children of his own. He was the one that let them build these tanks here. So this place can do little for me... in fact thanks to all those tests you've done it may be a liability. As you know I offered to lease the site to you at a fair price, but you were not interested?
ABEL	No.
JOSEPH	Why not?
ABEL	I like to own the things I use.
JOSEPH	I can see that.
ABEL	So.
JOSEPH	Yes. This contract here, your lawyers have fully reviewed it?
ANDREW WALSH	Of course.
JOSEPH	And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction?
JOSEPH	No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever.
ABEL	I understand.
JOSEPH	I want you to know this up front. I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. So this is business... and when you sign this....
ABEL	I understand.
JOSEPH	Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers.
ANDREW WALSH	Congratulations.
ABEL	It's not ours yet.
ANDREW WALSH	Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. It's a good day for us. Take a walk around. Enjoy it for a second.
CONTRACTOR	Hello?
ABEL	There he is.
ABEL	You have done a beautiful job here.
CONTRACTOR	Thank you.
ABEL	I mean it. You and your men should be very proud.
CONTRACTOR	We are.
ABEL	Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. You are a lucky man.
CONTRACTOR	I am.
ABEL	Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here.
CONTRACTOR	I hope so.
ABEL	Now I think I owe you some money.
CONTRACTOR	That may be true.
ABEL	It is.
ABEL	This is the seventeen outstanding. But we are arriving here in four days. It must be done.
CONTRACTOR	Yes.
ABEL	Well, I'll let you go.
ABEL	And the tile in the master bath...
CONTRACTOR	It's being replaced, as I mentioned to your wife, that was an error on our part. Congratulations on your home.
ABEL	Thank you.
ANNA	They broke his jaw.
ABEL	Have they found the truck?
ANNA	Yes.
ABEL	Are you alright?
JULIAN
ABEL	Have the police been here yet?
ANNA	He was left in the middle of the highway without a truck, they brought him in.
ABEL	Can you speak?
ANNA	Not for a couple days... Can I speak with you outside?
ANNA	Did they sign the contract?
ABEL	Yes.
ANNA	And took the deposit?
ABEL	Yes.
ANNA	So it's a go?
ABEL	(he gives a nice nod yes)
ANNA	Congratulations.
ABEL	To you as well.
ANNA	We have thirty days?
ABEL	These fucking guys. This poor kid has been working his ass off.
ANNA	Do you want me to speak to my Brother about this?
ABEL	No...don't talk to him or your father.
ANNA	This can't continue.
ABEL	It won't.
ANNA	It will if we don't do something.
ABEL	I'm meeting with the D.A. in the morning.
ANNA	Oh, fuck the D.A. He's more interested in coming after us than helping us.
ANNA	It's not fair to them. You're at war here.
ABEL	No we are not.
ANNA	Really... because they are.
ABEL	Well I'm not.
ANNA	And you're going out to check on the new house?
ABEL	Yes.
ABEL	I have to get going.
ABEL	Can we get you anything?
ABEL	We'll pick you up when they let you out of here.
ABEL	These men are cowards. Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do.
ABEL	May I take it?
BEAT COP	Excuse me?
ABEL	May I take it now?
BEAT COP	Is it yours?
ABEL	Yes.
BEAT COP	Well, I'm sorry about that. Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again.
ABEL	So you guys have done what you needed to?
BEAT COP	Yes.
ABEL	And what was that?
BEAT COP	I'm sorry?
ABEL	You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done?
BEAT COP	(looks back dumbfounded)
ABEL	Did you fingerprint or anything?
BEAT COP	No need, these guys always wear gloves.
ABEL	So you've done nothing.
BEAT COP	I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. My shift is actually up.
ABEL	So who's coming?
BEAT COP	Sorry.
ABEL	They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it.
ANDREW WALSH	Lawrence. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
ANDREW WALSH	Yes...
ANDREW WALSH	We need your help.
ANDREW WALSH	Our trucks. They are being robbed.
LANGE)
ANDREW WALSH	We have a serious security issue.
DEPUTY LANGE	There have been a series of hijackings of bulk-fuel delivery vehicles.
ANDREW WALSH	Our drivers are being put in danger.
ANDREW WALSH	Of course.
ANDREW WALSH	I understand. But this is turning into an urgent and pressing matter for us.
ANDREW WALSH	Yes.
ABEL	My people are at risk just driving around in this city, just trying to do their jobs. And I... I have done everything you have asked of me. It's been two years since you first started investigating my company and I have spent thousands of dollars hiring lawyers for this and that to provide you with every piece of information your office has requested. And I expect that you have been asking the same from my competitors. So with all this information that you have gained... We are just asking if you have any idea who has been doing this to us?
ABEL	First, please know that we respect the work you are doing to try to help our business and the city. But also know I have never taken anything I haven't earned from anyone so when you say you've...
ABEL	We are on the same side here.
ABEL	Well, it makes a difference to me.
ABEL	Yes.
ABEL	I understand.
ABEL	You have your job to do. But know that you are wrong and that we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that.
ABEL	I'm sorry?
ABEL	Yes?
ANDREW WALSH	Like what?
ABEL	I am always trying to expand my business.
ABEL	Every new market is a difficult market.
ABEL	But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. And yet no one saw anything. That is a problem... no?
ABEL	I'm sure you do.
ANDREW WALSH	Abel. Abel.
ABEL	Exactly.
ANDREW WALSH	No... let's not overreact. We don't even know what they are bringing against us. It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. This isn't anything yet.
ABEL	I know.
ANNA	How'd it go?
ABEL	The DA... He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week.
ANNA	For what?
ABEL	We don't know yet.
ANNA	Who else?
ABEL	Right now they are just saying us.
ABEL	Where are we exposed?
ANNA	We follow standard industry practice on every front.
ABEL	Anna?
ANNA	I need to know what they are saying we did.
ABEL	Okay.
ABEL	I'm very sorry this happened. Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... Okay then.
JULIAN	Abel?
JULIAN	Do you think I am ready to move into sales?
ABEL	I don't.
JULIAN	I... I'm not sure I will be able...
ABEL	You will.
JULIAN	Did you get the truck back?
ABEL	Yes. They took the load.
JULIAN	This is the sixth one?
ABEL	Seventh... you get some rest.
ARNOLD KLINE	Well, look who it is.
ABEL	Arnold.
ARNOLD KLINE	Just a touch off the side Jimmy. Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair.
BARBER JIMMY	You're a good looking man.
ARNOLD KLINE	I know I am. So I hear congratulations are in order?
ABEL	What's that?
ARNOLD KLINE	You got yourself in contract over there.
ABEL	We are working on it.
ARNOLD KLINE	Thirty day close I hear, you better be.
ABEL	We are, thanks for your concern.
ARNOLD KLINE	I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day.
ABEL	Really? When was that?
ARNOLD KLINE	A couple times.
ABEL	It's possible.
ARNOLD KLINE	Is it?
ABEL	Yes.
ARNOLD KLINE	That's a tough market.
ABEL	It is.
ARNOLD KLINE	My father struggled for years before he broke in there.
ABEL	Any new market is a tough one. I'll see you.
ANNA	I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. For me...
ABEL	A toast.
ABEL	A toast to our new home. It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. Cheers.
PETER FORENTE	So you made the move?
ABEL	Peter... it's official as of yesterday.
COUNTER PERSON	Sir.
PETER FORENTE	So I heard about your rig getting picked off again.
ABEL	Yes.
PETER FORENTE	We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. We haven't had an incident since November. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us.
ABEL	That's possible.
PETER FORENTE	The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid.
ABEL	He's from Ohio. Played football. I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood...
PETER FORENTE	That's new territory for you, no?
ABEL	Just picked up a few new accounts over there. Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city.
PETER FORENTE	Which one is yours?
ABEL	Right there.
PETER FORENTE	She's beautiful.
ABEL	Thank you.
PETER FORENTE	Welcome to the neighborhood. You should be proud.
ABEL	Proud?
PETER FORENTE	Yes.
ANNIE	Dad. Mr. Walsh is here.
ANDREW WALSH	I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working.
ABEL	It's not set up yet... So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night.
ANDREW WALSH	No... It looks like they are coming after us.
ABEL	That describes many people at this point.
ANDREW WALSH	The D.A.
ABEL	How bad?
ANDREW WALSH	I still haven't seen it yet. But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. It's not good.
ABEL	Where are we exposed?
ANDREW WALSH	I'm not sure, a couple places probably.
ABEL	A couple places?
ABEL	Anna... Anna!
ANNA	Andrew.
ANDREW WALSH	Anna... sorry you've got no phone.
ABEL	As of tomorrow I'll have my new radio hooked up though so you should be able to reach me wherever I am...
ANDREW WALSH	The D.A. is going to bring down charges on us tomorrow.
ANNA	For what?
ANDREW WALSH	We don't know yet.
ANNA	Who else?
ANDREW WALSH	Right now they are just saying us.
ABEL	Where are we exposed?
ANNA	We follow standard industry practice on every front.
ABEL	What does that mean?
ANNA	You know what that means.
ANDREW WALSH	It means we may have some accounting exposure where we have pushed things a little too far.
ABEL	How far?
ANDREW WALSH	You always told us to push until we couldn't push any further. Well, we may have hit that line. So we will handle it and move on.
ABEL	Anna?
ANNA	I need to know what they are saying we did.
ANDREW WALSH	Let's not get ahead of ourselves here. You have always followed standard industry practices. We aren't even sure what this is yet. I just wanted to make sure you had all the information I do. This is a badge of honor, it means we are big enough to give a shit about now. Don't worry.
ABEL	Okay.
ANNA	Thank you for coming by Andrew.
ANDREW WALSH	Very impressive.
ABEL	Thank you.
ANNA	It only cost him a year of the kid's tuition.
ANDREW WALSH	And one more thing. I got a call from the union... O'Leary.
ANNA	What word?
ANDREW WALSH	There is real concern about their safety.
ABEL	Who?
ANNA	All of them.
ANDREW WALSH	The drivers are feeling unprotected.
ANNA	Because they are.
ANDREW WALSH	I just think you should talk to them about it. Before it grows into something.
ABEL	Okay.
ANDREW WALSH	Good night.
ANNA	What's he doing?
ABEL	Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing.
ABEL	Quiet. It's nothing. Come down here.
ABEL	Go. Oh come on. Go.
ANNA	Where were you?
ABEL	(looking to the dog) A lot of help you were.
ANNA	Abel?
ANNA	Who was it?
ABEL	What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was?
ABEL	I don't know.
ABEL	I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off.
ANNA	If you...
ABEL	Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't.
ANNA	Seems like a message was sent loud and clear.
ABEL	Please. Don't get going on this. We are a big new house. He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. The alarm will be in on Monday. It was some kid. They aren't coming back.
ABEL	What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. But now...
ABEL	When this door opens you begin to close. It must always be spotless. If they see you have ever done this before it is over.
ABEL	Now, you do this and only this... You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. Very very slowly and small.
ABEL	Don't look up at them. Just at the cloth.
INSTRUCTOR	Do you hear that noise... that's the noise.
ABEL	It means you are close... Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. And say "I'd love to run a few numbers for you. Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit." They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. And whatever it is you always take the fancy option.
INSTRUCTOR	Can I get you a coffee or tea?
ABEL	A tea please.
INSTRUCTOR	We have some homemade lemonade or a soda.
ABEL	I'd love a lemonade, thank you.
ABEL	Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable.
ABEL	I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. And that's never easy. So to get them over the line you need to close them. So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them...
ABEL	You stare longer than you should. Because this is not a joke. You will only keep this job if you close. And that's not funny to you. And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth.
ABEL	Well... it was great to meet you. Welcome and I wish you luck.
ABEL	Good morning. First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. So, on that front we have these.
ABEL	These will be in every truck by the end of the week. Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the
BACK)	Yes, Eddy.
ABEL	We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time.
ABEL	Yes.
ANNA	Catherine... Catherine. Katie!
CATHERINE	Mommy.
ANNA	Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this?
CATHERINE	Right here.
ANNA	Show me.
CATHERINE	It was just sitting right here.
ANNA	Did you see this?
ELIZABETH	Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it.
ANNA	Maria!
ELIZABETH	What is it?
ANNA	Maria!
ELIZABETH	Mom, is it real?
ABEL	What is that?
ANNA	A gun... It's a gun Abel.
ABEL	Where did you get it?
ANNA	Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it.
ANNA	It's loaded... with the safety off.
ANNA	Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here?
ABEL	Let me see that. I'll take care of this.
ANNA	Damn right we will. Who is this?
ABEL	I don't know, but I will take care of it.
ANNA	What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun!
ABEL	I know what it is!
ABEL	Let me deal with this.
ANNA	You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved.
ABEL	You are not to tell your father about this.
ABEL	Do you hear me.
ANNA	...I won't.
ANDREW WALSH	Can I talk with you both?
ANNA	I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last night.
ANDREW WALSH	Who?
ABEL	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	Well...
ABEL	That truck just went out filthy.
ANNA	Abel!
ANDREW WALSH	We are going to owe them some money.
ABEL	How much?
ANDREW WALSH	That depends on a bunch of factors. But that's an accounting question.
ABEL	You need to get home and start going through our set of books. How far back are they going?
ANDREW WALSH	Seems like all the way back to when you bought out Anna's father.
ANNA	I'll get into it.
ABEL	What is O'Leary doing here?.
ANDREW WALSH	He's been wanting to talk to you for days.
ABEL	(under his breath) Jesus.
ANNA	Andrew can I talk to you for a minute.
ABEL	How are you Bill?
BILL O'LEARY	I'm ok. Can't say I'm used to making house calls like this anymore though.
ABEL	I would have come to see you.
BILL O'LEARY	That's alright. You've got bigger things to worry about. (Long pause) So, I can't have this situation with your guys continuing.
ABEL	My guys.
BILL O'LEARY	Your drivers.
ABEL	Good. I would love you to help on this. Because I can't have it going on any longer either.
BILL O'LEARY	So let them protect themselves, that would stop all this very quickly.
ABEL	I respectfully disagree.
BILL O'LEARY	They are picking on your men because they are just sitting there... weak.
ABEL	They are taking shots at me because I am growing, expanding, getting stronger not weaker.
BILL O'LEARY	It's quite simple for me: I can't have my drivers getting hit like this. It looks like I can't protect them.
ABEL	Well, it appears that you can't.
BILL O'LEARY	I can. And will. Because of all my job descriptions that is the one I consider most sacred.
ABEL	I agree. But these are truck drivers, not soldiers, this will lead to chaos.
BILL O'LEARY	It will stop immediately.
ABEL	No, it won't.
BILL O'LEARY	You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. Trust me I understand. So let me think this through. But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. It's not like when we were driving.
ABEL	Yes.
BILL O'LEARY	Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools.
ABEL	It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me.
BILL O'LEARY	It's not always as simple as it appears.
ABEL	I'm sure that's true.
BILL O'LEARY	It is... well, I got to get going.
ABEL	Thank you for coming Bill.
ANDREW WALSH	How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY	Not well.
ANDREW WALSH	He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY	I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH	I don't think he fully understands it.
BILL O'LEARY	What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH	It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY	It's not illegal if I say it isn't. My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. That can not and will not continue.
ANDREW WALSH	I understand.
BILL O'LEARY	So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. This is very serious. Just know that.
ANDREW WALSH	How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY	What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH	I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY	Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH	No.
BILL O'LEARY	Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun.
ANDREW WALSH	And a permit?
BILL O'LEARY	By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH	Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY	That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH	Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY	I don't fucking know...
ANDREW WALSH	I'll talk to him.
ANNA	He's not here.
ANNA	Okay. I will.
ANDREW WALSH	How did that go?
BILL O'LEARY	Not well.
ANDREW WALSH	He feels very strongly about this.
BILL O'LEARY	I can see that.
ANDREW WALSH	I don't think he fully understands it.
BILL O'LEARY	What's to understand?
ANDREW WALSH	It's illegal.
BILL O'LEARY	It's not illegal if I say it isn't.
ANDREW WALSH	I understand.
BILL O'LEARY	So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. As a company.
ANDREW WALSH	I will try to talk with him.
BILL O'LEARY	This is very serious. Just know that.
ANDREW WALSH	How would this work?
BILL O'LEARY	What does that mean?
ANDREW WALSH	I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting.
BILL O'LEARY	Are you kidding me with this?
ANDREW WALSH	No.
BILL O'LEARY	Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun.
ANDREW WALSH	And a permit?
BILL O'LEARY	By Friday.
ANDREW WALSH	Are the permits legit?
BILL O'LEARY	That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop.
ANDREW WALSH	Who is it?
BILL O'LEARY	I don't fucking know...
ANDREW WALSH	They just got another truck.
ABEL	I know.
ANDREW WALSH	Who was driving?
ABEL	Leo.
ANDREW WALSH	Is he alright?
ABEL	Yes.
ANDREW WALSH	The drivers' security aside... this shit is starting to have a very significant financial effect on us here. It can't continue.
ABEL	I know.
ANDREW WALSH	How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for.
ABEL	I said I wouldn't do it.
ANDREW WALSH	I'm not sure we are in a position to say that.
ABEL	What's that?
ANDREW WALSH	Do you want to go for a walk?
ABEL	Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters?
ANDREW WALSH	I am and it is.
ANDREW WALSH	It is looking like we must do this.
ABEL	I must?
ANDREW WALSH	They will shut you down.
ABEL	These men, they work for me. These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. They are here because we built this.
ANDREW WALSH	That's true, until its not. And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. We are running out of cash.
ABEL	What are you even talking about here?
ANDREW WALSH	The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week.
ABEL	These men are fucking truck drivers. This is insane. You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. This comes back to me.
ANDREW WALSH	It does either way.
ABEL	I'm not doing it.
ANDREW WALSH	Would you put everything at risk to stand by that.
ABEL	It will be the end of everything I have worked for. If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... And we need to close this deal. We can't stay like this any longer. We must close on that property... We are so weak right now.
ANDREW WALSH	Why do you want this so badly?
ABEL	Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. It is everything.
ANDREW WALSH	That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk... always.
ABEL	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	You don't know? Have you ever thought about it?
ABEL	I've thought about it every day for the last five years. This place was sitting over that fence mocking....
ANDREW WALSH	I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place...
ABEL	I don't know what you mean.
ABEL	I know what you are asking and no... I never ask myself why I do this. It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. It feels right.
ANDREW WALSH	That's very simple.
ABEL	Yes...
ABEL	...It is.
ANDREW WALSH	You take these risks...
ABEL	Only when necessary.
ANDREW WALSH	We have to get going, we need them to show up.
ANNA	Arthur.
ARTHUR LEWIS	Anna, you look amazing as always.
ANNA	Thank you.
ARTHUR LEWIS	Gentlemen. Do you know Ian Thompson? One of our new VP's.
ANNA	Ian.
WAITER	So what can I get you to drink?
ABEL	A lot.
ABEL	A wine list please.
WAITER	I'll be right back.
ARTHUR LEWIS	So how are you?
ABEL	We've been better... but we are good.
ARTHUR LEWIS	Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually.
ANNA	Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way.
ANDREW WALSH	Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over?
ARTHUR LEWIS	Yes, we did.
ANNA	Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand.
ABEL	But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that...
ABEL	But... but...
ABEL	...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. We need to know you are standing by us.
ABEL	That's a very good question. This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. I won't just drive trucks anymore... I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question...
ABEL	... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do.
ARTHUR LEWIS	We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be.
ANNA	Well, that went about as well as could be expected.
ABEL	Yes. Arthur is a good man.
ANNA	Do you think they will close?
ABEL	Of course.
ABEL	Are you okay?
ANNA	Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery.
ABEL	Jesus.
ANNA	I mean it. We can't just leave it here.
ANNA	Is it dead?
ABEL	No.
ANNA	Well you need...
ABEL	I know.
ANNA	What are you doing?
ABEL	Getting the tire iron!
ANNA	Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine?
NANNY MARIA	Oh yes. All is good.
ANNA	Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then.
NANNY MARIA	Okay.
ANNA	What?
ABEL	What?
ANNA	Yes... what?
ABEL	Are you kidding?
ANNA	No.
ABEL	Okay then... what is this gun?
ANNA	I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it.
ABEL	Where did you get it?
ANNA	You know where I got it.
ABEL	Do you have a permit?
ANNA	Not yet.
ABEL	You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing?
ABEL	You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are.
ANNA	You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound?
ABEL	Where is this thing? Let me see it.
ANNA	Abel.
ABEL	Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe?
ABEL	You know who uses guns like this?	Whores!
ABEL	It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... You need to get that thing out of our house.
ANNA	You need to protect us.
ABEL	That is what I'm doing.
GROUP	Happy Birthday!
ABEL	I understand. But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. I am having my daughter's birthday party.
POLICE OFFICER	I understand and I apologize, I do. But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property.
ANNA	What is this?
POLICE OFFICER	Let me go check something.
ANNA	Are they serious?
ABEL	I'm going to kill this guy.
ANNA	Abel.
ABEL	Abel.
ABEL	Give me five minutes.
ABEL	Maria. Keep the kids playing for a few minutes.
ANNA	Mr. Lawrence is it?
ANNA	Anna Morales.
ANNA	May I speak with you for a minute.
ANNA	I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party.
ANNA	That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home?
ANNA	Thank you.
ANNA	Where are you going?
ABEL	Bring the last few out.
ANNA	You've got three minutes.
ABEL	What's going on out there.
ANNA	Our guests are leaving.
ABEL	Do we even need to be doing this? What exactly are we hiding here?
ANNA	I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to.
ABEL	Is that the last one. Get back out there.
ANNA	Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. Bye.
ANNA	This is probably one that you are going to regret.
ANNA	My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very aggressive.
ANNA	Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends.
ANNA	Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing.
ABEL	Hey, how are you?
ABEL	You'll do great. Remember... When you get them there. Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens.
ABEL	Good luck.
ABEL	It is good to see you back here. You look good.
JULIAN	Thank you.
ABEL	Are you ready to get back to work?
JULIAN	I think so.
ABEL	You are.
JULIAN	Thank you.
ABEL	Where are you heading?
JULIAN	Bulk delivery to Chase.
ABEL	Manhattan. That's a cakewalk.
JULIAN	I feel very vulnerable.
ABEL	Good... Because you are. We all are. Someone came to my house a couple nights ago to rob me...
ABEL	I tried to chase them away... but really there's nothing I can do. I am vulnerable. We all are. They can come back tonight. But to succeed and be great you must keep going back. And I know what all these guys want to be doing. But it doesn't make you any safer.
ABEL	And then they will come after me with everything they have... So this is what we do. And the times will get better and safer. They will. So go. You are strong just by going. Stronger in fact.
HUSBAND	Hey.
HUSBAND	Sure. I just had one question about our exhaust chimney. Would you be willing to take a look.
HUSBAND	It's just outside on the other side of this wall here.
HUSBAND	Please.
JULIAN	Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there.
JULIAN	Get the fuck away from me!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Okay, man.
THUG #2	Over here.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Where is he?
THUG #2	Over here.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Get the car!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero eh?
JULIAN	Fuck you.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Couldn't just let us take the truck.
JULIAN	Fuck you!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Hey man relax... calm down. Did they see you come in here?
JULIAN	I don't think so.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Did they or not?
JULIAN	No.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. Don't go out there, that's the street. Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. They won't be there.
JULIAN	Fuck you!
LOUIS SERVIDIO	You're welcome.
PETER FORENTE	It's a pretty cool machine, isn't it?
ABEL	Peter.
PETER FORENTE	Yes.
ABEL	I need to speak with you.
PETER FORENTE	I see that.
ABEL	This has gotten out of control... There was a guy with a gun at my house.
ABEL	My wife and children were home at the time.
PETER FORENTE	Is everyone okay?
ABEL	Yes. I managed to chase him off.
PETER FORENTE	Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary... what can I do.
ABEL	I need to know who is doing this.
PETER FORENTE	Abel...
ABEL	It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers... and to steal from me... but this... it's different.
PETER FORENTE	Yes.
ABEL	Have you ever dealt with anything like this?
PETER FORENTE	Have you met my father?
ABEL	I refuse to live my life that way. I won't do it... I am going to ask for a meeting.
PETER FORENTE	Who?
ABEL	Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being there?
PETER FORENTE	Yes... When are you closing on the terminal?
ABEL	Monday.
PETER FORENTE	Congratulations.
ABEL	Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.)
PETER FORENTE	Well, good luck.
ABEL	Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this...
PETER FORENTE	I know you do. My father is in jail... as you know. And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did.
ABEL	And you have.
PETER FORENTE	Almost exclusively, yes. But I know why he did what he did. Because at the time it's easier.
ABEL	But it's not.
PETER FORENTE	Yes it is. You are a good man. I will see what I can find out. This isn't good for any of us.
ABEL	Thank you.
ABEL	Joanne it's me. What are you talking about... what shots?
ABEL	I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. It's not the way I do business. In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. It is terrible for me.
ABEL	Yes.
ABEL	No... but I'll find him.
ARTHUR LEWIS	Abel.
ABEL	Arthur.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I wanted to come and talk to you in person... We aren't going to be able to show up for you on Monday. We can't do the loan.
ABEL	I...
ARTHUR LEWIS	I wanted to let you know as soon as possible so that you could try to put something else together.
ABEL	Thank you for coming... This is not right.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I know.
ABEL	What can I do?
ARTHUR LEWIS	Nothing... The loan review committee met this afternoon and won't meet again for two weeks.
ABEL	And you are aware of the position this is putting me in?
ARTHUR LEWIS	I am.
ABEL	I paid off my first loan to you eleven years ago.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I know.
ABEL	Do you remember the term on that loan?
ARTHUR LEWIS	I don't.
ABEL	I had seven years to pay you back.
ABEL	Do you know how long it took me to pay you off?
ARTHUR LEWIS	Seven months?
ABEL	Six and a half.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I'm sorry.
ABEL	I put 40 percent down as a deposit on this. It's all we had.
ARTHUR LEWIS	You now have three separate serious pending legal cases against you. One with sixteen counts of misconduct ranging from fraud to tax evasion. And then in the middle of our meeting today I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers which led to a shoot-out on the 59th Street Bridge.
ABEL	None of it is true.
ARTHUR LEWIS	That may be.
ABEL	May?
ARTHUR LEWIS	It doesn't matter.
ABEL	It does matter, that you know we didn't do this.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I do... I do. But it doesn't matter, I can't do anything. I'm sorry.
ABEL	I'll find it.
ARTHUR LEWIS	I know you will.
ANNA	It's horrible.
ABEL	Yes.
ANNA	Where is he?
ABEL	We're looking for him.
ANNA	And they haven't gotten the other guys?
ABEL	Of course not.
ANNA	Are you okay?
ABEL	No... I'm not... They're out.
ANNA	Who?
ABEL	The bank.
ANNA	So what does that mean?
ABEL	It means we need to find the money somewhere else.
ANNA	We have two days!
ABEL	I'll figure it out.
DAUGHTERS	Move.
ANNA	Quiet.
DAUGHTERS	You move.
ANNA	Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around you!
ANNA	That's it Annie we've told you...
ABEL	You are thirteen years old. What are you doing? Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an...
ANNIE	Oh fuck you!
ABEL	What? What? What are you talking about?
ABEL	I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her.
ANNIE	The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing!
ABEL	First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again!
ANNA	Stop!!
ABEL	Hey.
ANNA	Hi.
ABEL	How's it coming?
ANNA	I've made it to 1975.
ABEL	That was a good year.
ABEL	Well it was for me...how is it?
ANNA	I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing.
ANNA	How'd you do?
ABEL	I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short.
ANNA	You're going to see your little brother?
ABEL	First thing.
ANNA	And Peter?
ABEL	Probably.
ANNA	This is all worth it.
ABEL	Of course.
ABEL	You should get to bed.
ANNA	I'll be up.
ABEL	I love you.
ANNA	I love you too.
ANDREW WALSH	Is Julian here?
LUISA	No.
ANDREW WALSH	Abel would like to speak with him. To help him.
LUISA	I will tell him.
JULIAN	He's turning me in?
ANDREW WALSH	Of course we are turning you in. You have put everything that man has worked for for the last 20 years at risk. If it was up to me we would be dealing with this in a very different way.
JULIAN	But I know things...
ANDREW WALSH	Really?
JULIAN	Yes.
ANDREW WALSH	And what things do you know?
JULIAN	I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	I am too.
JULIAN	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	Where's the gun?
JULIAN	I threw it in the river.
ANDREW WALSH	Good. Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true?
JULIAN	Why is this putting everything at risk?
ANDREW WALSH	Have you ever been arrested?
JULIAN	No.
ANDREW WALSH	Because no bank will touch us right now. So we can't close on the new property. And he's going to lose everything on his deposit.
JULIAN	I'm sorry.
ABEL	I know.
JULIAN	I was scared.
ABEL	I know.
JULIAN	Aren't you scared?
ABEL	Sometimes.
JULIAN	What do you do?
ABEL	I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else.
JULIAN	I...
ABEL	It wasn't always like this.
JULIAN	Are you ruined?
ABEL	Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe.
JULIAN	I'm sorry.
ABEL	Good...
JULIAN	No... I am not strong.
ABEL	That does not have to be true.
JULIAN	Trust me... I am not... I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	I'm late. I will meet you at four.
ABEL	I'm gonna try to get us a little more time.
COP 1	Hey.
ABEL	Thank you for seeing me.
JOSEPH	Of course.
ABEL	I need more time.
JOSEPH	Of course you do.
ABEL	I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. But... I need more time.
JOSEPH	Why?
ABEL	Thank you for asking. Many, many reasons.
JOSEPH	It's a difficult time to do business.
ABEL	Yes... it is.
JOSEPH	I'll give you three more days. Then it's over.
ABEL	Thank you.
ANDREW WALSH	We didn't think he'd react that way.
ANDREW WALSH	I'm sorry.
ANDREW WALSH	So are we... it's very sad. He was very close to Abel.
DEPUTY LANGE	It has been brought to our attention that it might be beneficial on your end to resolve this issue in a time sensitive way.
ANDREW WALSH	Possibly.
DEPUTY LANGE	So we have prepared an offer for you to review.
ANDREW WALSH	I'll show this to them. He'll never go for it, but it's a start.
ANDREW WALSH	I know... I will present it to him.
ANDREW WALSH	You need what to stop?
ANDREW WALSH	Starting to be? No shit.
ANDREW WALSH	I understand. The kid went out and got his own gun. This was not us. No matter what you think of him, Abel doesn't work this way.
ANDREW WALSH	He wants to talk to them. We've been trying to set up a meeting. O'Leary hasn't been able to get it done.
ABEL	I talked to the Hasid, I got us three days.
ANDREW WALSH	Is that enough?
ABEL	I don't know.
ANDREW WALSH	Well here it is. It's just a first pass.
ABEL	Felons can't vote.
ANDREW WALSH	I'm sorry?
ABEL	This plea has me...
ANDREW WALSH	I know. It's just a first offer.
ABEL	I would never take this.
ANDREW WALSH	I know.
ABEL	Who?
ANDREW WALSH	Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary.
ABEL	Of course he is.
ANDREW WALSH	Does Julian have anything?
ABEL	All the drivers could have us on scales. Why?
ANDREW WALSH	If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute.
ABEL	He would never do that.
ANDREW WALSH	We need to find him... Lawrence needs him.
ABEL	Thank you for letting me in.
LUISA	Of course.
ABEL	Have you seen Julian?
LUISA	No.
ABEL	We need to find him.
LUISA	I know.
ABEL	I am worried about him.
LUISA	So am I.
ABEL	You know we were going to support him. I do not know why he ran.
LUISA	He was scared.
ABEL	I know.
LUISA	He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right?
ABEL	Yes. Well this time that hasn't worked out.
LUISA	No... How did you do it?
ABEL	Do what?
LUISA	This.
LUISA	Success... that's all he wanted.
ABEL	I know. It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please.
LUISA	I will.
ABEL	Does he have any money?
LUISA	I'm sorry?
ABEL	Money? Has he taken money out of your bank account?
LUISA	I don't know?
ABEL	You need to start looking into these things. It is very important that we find him safely.
ABEL	Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way!
ABEL	(in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart.
ABEL	There are other people looking for him. I am as good an option as he has. Know this.
ANDREW WALSH	Fuck You! You better run!
ABEL	Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	Of course.
ABEL	I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	I am.
ABEL	I'm sorry to ask but how old are you?
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	I'm 23.
ABEL	Oh.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business.
ABEL	Yes.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times.
ABEL	Yes.
LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ	His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully did.
ABEL	I understand. And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	I understand.
ABEL	But, I am not here to offer to buy your company.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	Oh.
ABEL	As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	I see.
ABEL	And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	I'm sorry.
ABEL	So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder.
SAUL LEFKOWITZ	How much?
ABEL	I need $500,000.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	Would you give us a minute.
ABEL	Of course.
LEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST	You can go back in.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year.
ABEL	Okay. Thank you.
LORAINE LEFKOWITZ	So, I guess we will see you tonight?
ABEL	Tonight? Oh yes, of course.
BILL O'LEARY	Abel. Please sit.
ABEL	Stop...
PETER FORENTE	Um... Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight.
ABEL	Peter... thank you... That may be true.
ABEL	But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. And profiting from it. So what I am saying is... Stop! Now. Have some pride in what you do and stop.
ABEL	Hey.
ANNA	Hi.
ABEL	How's it coming?
ANNA	I've made it to 1975.
ABEL	That was a good year.
ABEL	Well it was for me...how is it?
ANNA	I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... I guess I knew what I was doing.
ANNA	How'd you do?
ABEL	I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short.
ANNA	You're going to see your little brother?
ABEL	First thing.
ANNA	And Peter?
ABEL	Probably.
ABEL	How are the girls? I feel like I haven't seen them in days.
ANNA	They're fine.
ANNA	This is all worth it.
ABEL	Of course.
ANNA	Look at us...it is.
ABEL	I know.
ABEL	We should get to bed.
ANNA	I'll be up.
ABEL	I love you.
ANNA	I love you too.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	Please. Please.
ABEL	Your friend is dead... who do you work for.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	You know I could never tell you that.
ABEL	Stop... just stop.
LOUIS SERVIDIO	This was it anyway. Okay... Okay.
ARNOLD KLINE	Hey.
ABEL	Jimmy, can you give me a minute?
ARNOLD KLINE	Abel, that was well said.
ABEL	Thank you.
ARNOLD KLINE	What can I do for you?
ABEL	I've just come to collect that check you owe me.
ARNOLD KLINE	What check is that?
ABEL	The one for $213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE	I'm sorry?
ABEL	That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months.
ARNOLD KLINE	I had nothing to do with that.
ABEL	Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks.
ARNOLD KLINE	That's not possible.
ABEL	I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now.
ARNOLD KLINE	How much?
ABEL	I said...213,000.
ARNOLD KLINE	I'll need a day.
ABEL	Okay.
ARNOLD KLINE	I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. I would never do that.
ABEL	My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long.
ARNOLD KLINE	Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit.
ABEL	I don't care.
ARNOLD KLINE	It may ruin me.
ABEL	When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. Kinda makes you miss having your father around? But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon.
ABEL	You look good out there.
ELIAS	I didn't know you were coming.
ABEL	I didn't either... I didn't mean to take you away.
ELIAS	We're done.
ELIAS	Thanks for coming.
ABEL	Of course. You've grown.
ELIAS	You saw me a month ago.
ABEL	I know... but you have.
ABEL	The girls at this place... they are so beautiful?
ELIAS	Yes.
ABEL	I don't know how you get anything done around here.
ELIAS	I don't.
ABEL	I'm in a bit of a rough patch.
ELIAS	Yes...
ABEL	It happens.
ELIAS	I know.
ABEL	Good...
ABEL	That will be your burden...
ELIAS	What will?
ABEL	Not having had one.
ABEL	I need your signature on this.
ELIAS	What is it?
ABEL	I need to take out a short term mortgage on our apartment building.
ELIAS	That thing isn't worth more than 150 grand though?
ABEL	210.
ELIAS	Since when do you need to be taking out sucker mortgages for 200 grand?
ABEL	I'm up against it a bit. It will be fine.
ABEL	Thank you... It's good to see your face.
ELIAS	I love you.
ABEL	I love you too.
PETER FORENTE	Well here he is. The caped crusader.
ABEL	Yes.
PETER FORENTE	Come over. Are you alright?
ABEL	I am.
PETER FORENTE	Did they catch any of them? Sit.
ABEL	The one guy didn't make it out of the crash, and the other guy disappeared.
PETER FORENTE	That was very well said last night.
ABEL	Thank you. And thanks for seeing me.
PETER FORENTE	Of course. So what is it?
ABEL	I need a loan.
PETER FORENTE	You don't want to do that.
ABEL	No shit... but I'm here.
PETER FORENTE	What are we talking about here.
ABEL	Six hundred thousand.
PETER FORENTE	Jesus. Abel, that's a problem.
ABEL	Yes... but if I don't get it...
PETER FORENTE	What's my collateral?
ABEL	The terminal.
PETER FORENTE	Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. No way.
ABEL	You'll get your money.
PETER FORENTE	Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. But this would be different. I don't want you to be in this position. We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from.
ABEL	I know that.
PETER FORENTE	Let's sleep on this. Both of us.
ANNA	What a day.
ABEL	Yeah.
ANNA	Are you okay?
ABEL	Yes.
ANNA	Car chases?
ABEL	Yeah.
ANNA	Who knew?
ANNA	How was your brother?
ABEL	He seemed good... But the girls up at that place are...
ANNA	Stop.
ABEL	I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school...
ANNA	Enough.
ABEL	How are we here?
ANNA	It was a lot of things all at once.
ABEL	Yeah.
ANNA	How did it go?
ABEL	We can probably pull it off. Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... Peter suddenly showed me his true colors.
ANNA	I'm sorry.
ABEL	I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster...
ANNA	I know.
ABEL	...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me.
ABEL	What is this?
ANNA	It's a bank account.
ABEL	Whose?
ANNA	Ours.
ABEL	How much is in it?
ANNA	A lot.
ABEL	What does that mean?
ANNA	It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal.
ABEL	Where did it come from?
ANNA	Abel.
ABEL	Where did it come from?
ANNA	Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little... others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... I didn't know what else to do... I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing.
ANNA	I'm sorry.
ABEL	What do you expect me to do with this?
ANNA	Use it.... Abel...
ABEL	Is it clean?
ANNA	What does that mean?
ABEL	It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out?
ANNA	It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made.
ABEL	That's a fucking bullshit answer.
ANNA	I can clear it on the books.
ABEL	Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. And you can use that when they drag me off to jail!
ANNA	So what's your plan here?
ABEL	I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat.
ANNA	(Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about...
ABEL	You stole from me!
ANNA	Oh... You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me.
ABEL	We'll use the money... your money. It's the smart play.
ANNA	It's our money.
ABEL	I know...
ANNA	These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000?
ABEL	I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks... they gave us a fair price on it.
JOSEPH	Mazel Tov.
ANDREW WALSH	Congratulations.
ABEL	To you too. Did you know...about the money?
ANNA	Abel.
ANDREW WALSH	Yes.
ABEL	You should have told me.
ANDREW WALSH	I know. I'm sorry.
ANNA	Abel...congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for?
ANNA	What a hell-hole this city is.
ABEL	No.
ANDREW WALSH	I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here.
ABEL	I did.
ABEL	I thought you said you threw that into the river?
JULIAN	I didn't.
ABEL	I see that.
JULIAN	I have nowhere to go.
ABEL	Nowhere easy.
JULIAN	Fuck you. I have nothing. And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted.
ABEL	It wasn't meant to be.
JULIAN	What is that supposed to mean?
ABEL	I know what you wanted. But you need to forget that. You are looking backward. Only look forward, that is what you can control.
JULIAN	I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right?
ABEL	Yes.
JULIAN	Probably a better chance than I deserved.
ABEL	No.
JULIAN	Please take care of my family.
ABEL	Julian.
JULIAN	Please...
ABEL	I will.
ANDREW WALSH	What... what should we do?
ABEL	We call the police.
ANDREW WALSH	Really?
ABEL	Yes!
ABEL	I did.
ABEL	Yeah. For a while I thought he was... it's just...
ABEL	You really do have to be lucky.
ABEL	I was right there... I couldn't help myself.
ABEL	Have you found the driver?
ABEL	You'll find him.
ABEL	Well, thank you for coming. I wanted to make sure this was handled correctly.
ABEL	I'm not sure how I got here.
ABEL	So... I should tell you that I won't be able to take that deal you offered. There is no way I would ever accept a felony charge for anything we've done.
ABEL	I am not a felon.
ABEL	But I also can't have you digging around my life and keeping this hanging around my neck for the next ten years. I love fighting a good battle but this... it's very bad for my business.
ABEL	So, we need to come to some sort of conclusion.
ABEL	Good.
ABEL	It looks that way.
ABEL	For a very long time.
ABEL	Within my business it has that potential.
ABEL	Yes.
ABEL	Yes, I have.
ABEL	It doesn't feel that way... But please know that I have always chosen the path that was the most right.
ABEL	Yes.
ABEL	The result is never in question for me. Just what path do I take to get there. And I have never questioned my path. There is always one that is most right. And that is what this is.
