Martian, The

MARK	In grid section fourteen twenty-eight, the particles appear predominantly "coarse," but as we move to twenty-nine, the particles are much finer, and should be ideal for chem analysis.
MARTINEZ	Mark just discovered "dirt." Alert the media.
MARK	What's your job today, Martinez? Confirming the MAV is still upright?
MARTINEZ	Visual inspection of equipment is imperative to mission success.
MARTINEZ	"The MAV is still upright."
VOICE	Watney, you keep leaving your channel open...
LEWIS	Which leads to Martinez responding, which leads to us listening, which leads to me being annoyed.
MARK	Martinez, Commander Lewis would like you please shut your smart mouth.
VOICE	Speaking for the smart people of the world...
BECK	We would prefer you use a different adjective to describe Martinez' mouth.
MARTINEZ	Did Beck just insult me?
MARK	Doctor Beck. And yes.
VOICE	Happy to turn their radios off from here, Commander...
JOHANSSEN	Just say the word.
MARK	Johanssen, constant communication is the hallmark of a --
LEWIS	Shut `em off.
LEWIS	I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel.
ALEX	Accepted. How many samples do we need, Commander?
LEWIS	Seven. One hundred grams each. Drill at least thirty centimeters down.
JOHANSSEN	Um... Commander? You should come inside...
LEWIS	What is it?
JOHANSSEN	We got a mission update. Storm warning.
LEWIS	I saw the warning in the morning briefing. We'll be inside long before it hits.
JOHANSSEN	They've upgraded their estimate.	The storm's gonna be worse.
LEWIS	"...twelve-hundred kilometers in diameter, bearing 24.41 degrees..."
JOHANSSEN	That's tracking right towards us.
LEWIS	"...based on current escalation, estimate a force of...	"Eighty-six hundred Newtons."
MARK	What's the Abort Force?
BECK	Seventy-five hundred.
MARTINEZ	Anything above that and the MAV could tip.
VOGEL	We're scrubbed?
LEWIS	"Begin abort procedures."
MARTINEZ	Maybe it won't be as bad as they say.
VOGEL	They're estimating with a margin of error. We can wait it out.
MARK	Let's wait it out.
JOHANSSEN	Commander?
LEWIS	Prep for emergency departure.
MARK
COMMANDER --
LEWIS	We're scrubbed.
LEWIS	Visibility is almost zero. If you get lost, home in on my suit's telemetry. The wind's gonna be rougher away from the Hab, so be ready.
MARK	Hey. Maybe we could shore up the MAV. Make tipping less likely.
LEWIS	How?
MARK	We could use cables from the solar farm as guy lines.
MARK	The rovers could be anchors. The trick would be getting around the--
JOHANSSEN	WATNEY!!!
LEWIS	What happened?
JOHANSSEN	Something hit him --
LEWIS	Watney, report --	WATNEY, REPORT!
JOHANSSEN BECK	alarm went off --
LEWIS JOHANSSEN	flew off due west --
LEWIS	Okay... okay... Martinez, get to the MAV and prep for launch. Everyone else, home in on Johanssen.
JOHANSSEN	I can't see anything --
VOGEL	Doctor Beck! How long can a person survive decompression?
BECK	Less than minute.
LEWIS	Line up and walk west. Small steps. He's probably prone. We don't want to step over him.
MARTINEZ	Commander -- The MAV's got an 8 degree tilt. It'll tip at 12.3 --
LEWIS	Copy that --
BECK	Johanssen, Watney's bio-monitor sent something before going offline. My computer just says "Bad Packet" --
JOHANSSEN	It didn't finish transmitting. (works her arm computer) I have the raw packet. It's plaintext:
BECK	Copy.	Blood pressure zero. Pulse rate zero. Temperature normal.
LEWIS	Temperature normal?
BECK	It takes a while for the... it takes a while for the body to cool.
LEWIS	Copy. If it tips, can you launch before it completely falls over?	Uh. Yes. Ma'am. I could take manual control.
LEWIS	Copy that. Everyone home in on Martinez' suit. That'll get you to the airlock. Get in and prep for launch.
VOGEL	What about you, Commander?
LEWIS	I'm searching a little more. Get moving. And Martinez, if you start to top, launch.
LEWIS	I just ordered you to. You three, get to the ship. (as they hesitate)
LEWIS	Johanssen, would the rover IR camera do any good?
BECK	What's she thinking? She's a geologist. She knows IR can't get through a sandstorm.
VOGEL	She's grasping. For anything.
MARTINEZ	Commander. We're tilting 11.6 degrees. One good gust and we're tipping.
MARTINEZ	No way. It's made to see Hermes in orbit, not the metal in a single suit.
BECK	Commander, I know you don't want to hear this, but Watn... Mark's dead.	Martinez, try the radar.
MARTINEZ	Roger.
MARTINEZ	What is wrong with you?
BECK	My friend just died. I don't want my Commander to die too.
LEWIS	Nothing?
MARTINEZ	It can barely see the Hab. There's not
ENOUGH MET--
MARTINEZ	Strap in! We're tipping!
JOHANSSEN VOGEL	never rock back --
BECK	Let it tip. We can't leave her.
MARTINEZ	We'll never be able to fix it if it tips. I got one trick left, then I'm following orders.
VOGEL	You are firing the OMS?
MARTINEZ JOHANSSEN
BECK	Commander. You need to get back to the ship. Now.
MARTINEZ	Agreed. He's gone, Ma'am...
JOHANSSEN	11.6... 11.5... holding at 11.5...
MARTINEZ	Still at pilot release. Ready for launch.
MARTINEZ	I'm sorry, Commander. You need to
VERBALLY --
LEWIS	Launch.
TEDDY	At around 4:30 a.m., central standard time, our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars.
TEDDY	By 6:45, the storm had escalated to "severe," and we had no choice but to abort the mission. Thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis, astronauts Beck, Johanssen, Martinez, and Vogel were all able to reach the Mars Ascent Vehicle and perform an emergency launch at 7:28 central time.	Unfortunately, during the evacuation, Astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed. Commander Lewis and the rest of her team were able to intercept safely with the Hermes and are now heading home... (wavers, then) But Mark Watney is dead.
MARK	Fuck.
THE MARTIAN
MARK	Okay. Okay...
MARK	This is... Mark Watney. Astronaut. I am entering this log for the record, in case I... don't make it. It's...
 MARK	oh-six-fifty-three on Sol 19. And... I'm still alive.	Obviously. But I'm guessing this is going to be a surprise to my crewmates. And NASA. And... the world. So... surprise.	I didn't die on Sol 18. Best I can tell -
MARK	-- this length of our primary communications antenna tore through my bio-monitor. And ripped a hole in me as well. It was horrible thank you for asking. But the antenna... and the blood... managed to seal the breach in my suit. Which kept me alive. Even though the team must have thought I was dead.	Commander Lewis... If you ever hear this... Listen. It wasn't your fault. Just bad luck. You did what you had to do, and if I had been in your position I would have done the same. I'm glad you guys made it.	All right, though. That's where we're at. Mark Watney, stranded on Mars. I have no way to contact NASA because our communications antenna broke and stuck into my stomach. Which we've covered. And even if I could, it will take... four years before the next manned mission gets here. And I'm in a Hab designed to last thirty-one days.	If the oxygenator breaks, I'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, I'll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I'll just sort of... implode. And if, by some miracle, none of that happens... eventually I'm going to run out of food. So... yeah.
MARK	Yeah.
MARK	Let's do the math...
MARK	Our surface mission here was supposed to take thirty-one days. For redundancy, they sent enough food to last for sixty- eight days. For six people. So for just me, it'll last three-hundred days. And I figure I can stretch that to four hundred if I ration. So... I've still gotta figure out how to grow three years worth of food. Here. On a planet where nothing grows. Luckily, I'm the botanist.
MARK	Mars will come to fear my botany powers.
MARK	The problem is water...	I have hundreds of liters of unused Hydrazine from the MDV. If I run the Hydrazine over an iridium catalyst, it'll separate into N2 and H2...
MARK	Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it. Luckily, in the history of humanity, nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire.
MARK	Believe it or not, the challenge has been finding something that will hold a flame. NASA hates fire. Because of the whole "fire makes everyone die in space" thing. So everything we brought with us is flame retardant. With the notable exception of... Martinez' personal items.
MARK	Sorry, Martinez. If you didn't want me to go through your stuff, you shouldn't have left me for dead on a desolate planet.
MARK	I figure God won't mind, considering the situation.
MARK	So. Yes. I blew myself up.	Best guess? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I've been exhaling when I did my calculations. Because I'm stupid.
MARK	Interesting side note: this is how Jet Propulsion Laboratory was founded. Five guys at Cal Tech were trying to make rocket fuel and nearly burned down their dorm. Rather than expel them, Professor... Von Karman? I want to say... banished them to a nearby farm in Pasadena and told them to keep working. And now we have a space program.	See? I pay attention.	I'm gonna get back to work. As soon as my ears stop ringing.
TEDDY	Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program. His loss will be deeply felt, but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth, onward and upward, unbroken in the mission of their agency. In doing so, they honor the legacy Mark leaves behind, and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain.
VINCENT	I thought you gave a lovely speech, by the way.
VINCENT	I need you to authorize my satellite time. Teddy gives it a quick glance, shakes his head.
TEDDY	It's not gonna happen.
VINCENT	We're funded for five Ares missions. I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth.
TEDDY	No.
VINCENT	They evac'd after eighteen sols. There's half a mission worth of supplies up there. I can sell another mission at a fraction of the cost. I just need to know what's left of our assets.
TEDDY	You're not the only one who needs satellite time. We've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up. We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater.
VINCENT	I'm talking about securing us another mission. We have twelve satellites in orbit, we can surely spare a few hours --
TEDDY	It's not about the satellite time, Vince.
TEDDY	We're a public domain organization. We have to be transparent about this.
VINCENT	And?
TEDDY	The second we point the satellites at the Hab... I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.
VINCENT	You're afraid of a PR problem?
TEDDY	Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem. Another mission? Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post.
VINCENT	So... what do we do? He's not going to decompose. He'll be there forever.
TEDDY	Meteorology estimates he'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year.
VINCENT	We can't wait a year for this. We have work to do.
TEDDY	Ares 5 won't even launch for another five years. We have plenty of time.
VINCENT	Okay, consider this. Right now, the world is on our side. Sympathy for Watney's family is high...
VINCENT	Ares 6 could bring the body back. We don't say that's the purpose of the mission, but we make it clear that would be part of it. We frame it that way, we get more support in Congress. I can sell it. But not if we wait a year.
VINCENT	In a year, people won't care any more.
MINDY	Acidalia Planitia...
MINDY	Security? This is Mindy Park in SatCon. I need the emergency contact number for Dr. Kapoor. Yes, him. Yes it's an
EMERGENCY --
WOMAN	Oh you have GOT to be SHITTING ME --
TEDDY	How sure?
VINCENT	Nearly 100%.
ANNIE	Do you understand the shitstorm that's about to hit us?
TEDDY	Annie, one thing at a time.	Prove it to me.
VINCENT	(points to images) For starters, the solar panels have been cleaned.
TEDDY	They could have been cleaned by wind.
VINCENT	Look at Rover 2. According to the logs, Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17. Plugged it into the Hab to recharge. It's been moved.
TEDDY	She could have forgotten to log the move.
VINCENT	Here's the clincher. Check the MDV. It's been taken apart. There's no way they do that without telling us.
ANNIE	Why don't we talk to Lewis? Let's go to CAPCOM and ask her directly right now.
TEDDY	No. If Watney is really alive... we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.
ANNIE	What? How can you not tell them?
TEDDY	They have another ten months on their trip home. Space travel is dangerous. We need them alert and undistracted.
ANNIE	They already think he's dead.
VINCENT	And they'd be devastated to find out they abandoned him alive.
ANNIE	You're on board with this?
VINCENT	We have to protect the crew. There's nothing they can do anyway. Let them deal with the emotional trauma when they're not trapped in a spaceship.
TEDDY	How do we handle the public?
ANNIE	We have twenty-four hours before we're required to release the pics.
TEDDY	We'll need to release a statement with them. We don't want people working it out on their own.
ANNIE	"Dear America. Remember that astronaut we thought we killed and had a nice funeral for? Turns out he's alive and we left him on Mars. Our bad. Sincerely,
TEDDY	I need to get on a plane to Chicago.
VINCENT	(Why? Oh...) Mark's parents.
TEDDY	They should hear it from me before it breaks on the news.
ANNIE	They'll be happy to hear their son's alive, at least.
TEDDY	He's alive. But if my math is right, he's gonna starve to death long before we can help him.	I'm not exactly looking forward to that conversation.
VINCENT	Can you even imagine what he's going through? He's fifty million miles from home. He thinks he's totally alone and that we all gave up on him. What kind of effect does that have on a man's psychology?	What's he thinking about right now?
MARK	I'm gonna die up here...
MARK	...if I have to listen to any more goddamn disco music.
MARK	Jesus, Commander Lewis, you couldn't have packed anything from this century?	I'm not turning the beat around. I refuse to.
MARK	But here's the rub. I've got two rovers designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before they need to be recharged at the Hab. That's problem A. Problem B is it'll take me... roughly fifty days to make the journey. So I have to be able to live for fifty days. Inside a rover with marginal life support the size of a small van.
MARK	And yeah, problem C is if I don't figure out how to make contact with NASA in the first place, none of this matters anyway. So... yes, in the face of overwhelming odds, I am left with only one option:	I'm gonna have to science the shit out of this.
MARK	Okay, so... success? I've doubled my battery life by scavenging Rover 1. BUT. If I use the heater, it'll eat up half my battery power every day. If I don't use the heater, I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics. (tries to stop shaking) I'd like to solve this problem, but unfortunately my brain is frozen.
MARK	But. As long as I don't break it...	I almost said "everything will be fine" out loud. My point is...
MARK	I'm not cold anymore. And yes, I could choose to think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me, but right now I have bigger problems on my hands. I've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis' personal drive, and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns.
REPORTER 1	Where is Watney going?
VINCENT	We believe he's preparing for a journey. He's conducting incremental tests -- taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer trips each time.
REPORTER 2	To what end? Why would he leave the relative safety of the Hab?
VINCENT	Communication. We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order to make contact with us. But it would be a dangerous gamble.
REPORTER 3	He'd be risking his life to talk to you?
VINCENT	This is the problem Mark faces. He's alone. And he needs to make contact to survive. But if we could talk to him, we'd tell him to stay put. Mark needs to trust we're doing everything in our power to bring him home alive.
ANNIE	Don't say "Bring him home alive." It reminds the world he might die.
VENKAT	You think people might forget that?
ANNIE	You asked how you did and I'm giving you my answer. My answer is "Eh." And yes, I'm going to make everyone forget there's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that's what you pay me for and unfortunately I need this job because I'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass.
VENKAT	Hard to believe tha--
ANNIE	I left them.
TEDDY	Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.
VINCENT	You know, these interviews aren't easy. God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive.
TEDDY	Annie...
ANNIE	No more Vincent on television. Copy that.
TEDDY	Seventy-six kilometers. Am I reading that right?
MINDY	Are you asking me?
TEDDY	I am.
MINDY	Yes, sir. Mark drove straight away from the Hab for almost two hours, did a short EVA, then drove for another two. We think the EVA was to change batteries.
GRUFF MAN	Are we doing a daddy/daughter thing today? Where's the Director of SatCon?
VINCENT	Ms. Park is the person who figured out Mark was alive in the first place. She's in charge of tracking him now.
TEDDY	Quit being a dick, Mitch. Where's Mark going? Is this another test?
MINDY	He's seventy-six kilometers away from the Hab. If it's a test and it doesn't work... he's dead.
TEDDY	He didn't load up the Oxygenator or the Water Reclaimer?
MINDY	I didn't see that happen, no sir.
TEDDY	You didn't see it?
MINDY	Every forty-one hours, we have a seventeen minute gap. It's just the way the orbits work. So... it's possible we missed something.
TEDDY	I want that gap down to four minutes. I'm giving you total authority over satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments. Make it happen.
MINDY	(um...) Okay.
TEDDY	Let's assume Ms. Park didn't miss something, so Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet. But he's smart enough to figure out that's his only chance. Bruce, what's the earliest we could get a presupply there?
BRUCE	With the positions of Earth and Mars, it'll take nine months. And it'll take us six months to build it in the first place.
TEDDY	Three months.	You're gonna say that's impossible, then I'm gonna give a speech about the blinding capabilities of the JPL team. And then you'll do the math in your head and say something like "The overtime alone will be a nightmare."
BRUCE	(oh god I didn't even think
OF THAT)	The overtime will be a nightmare.
TEDDY	Get started. I'll find you the money.
MITCH	It's time to tell the crew.
VINCENT	Mitch, we discussed this.
MITCH	You discussed this. But I'm the one who decides what's best for the crew. They deserve to know.
TEDDY	Sorry, Mitch. I'm with Vincent. They need to concentrate on getting home.
MITCH	Bullshit.
TEDDY	Once we have a real rescue plan, we'll tell them. Otherwise it's moot. Bruce has three months to get the payload done. That's all that matters right now.
BRUCE	We'll do our best.
TEDDY	Mark dies if you don't.	But, by the way, none of this matters, at all, if I don't figure out how to make contact with NASA...
MARK	I know what I'm gonna do.
MINDY	He's on the move again --
VINCENT	Where the hell is he going? He hasn't changed course in thirteen days. And he's nowhere near course for Ares 4...
MINDY	Unless he's not taking a direct route. Maybe he's trying to avoid some obstacle...
VINCENT	What obstacle? It's Acidalia Planitia. There's nothing out there but --
VINCENT	I need a map.
TECHNICIAN	Hey -- c'mon --
VINCENT	I'll buy you a new one.	What's the Hab's location?
MINDY	31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.
VINCENT	I know where he's going.
VINCENT	I need to get on an airplane!
TECHNICIAN	Who's he talking to?
MINDY	I'm honestly not sure.
VINCENT	What are the odds Mark can get it working again?
BRUCE	Hard to say. We lost contact in `97. We think it was battery failure.	Though I'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario.
VINCENT	Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce. I want talk to everyone who was here in
BRUCE	They're already waiting for you.
VINCENT	This the replica?
VINCENT	Pathfinder.
THEN:
THEN:
TIM	As soon as I received the high-gain response, I directed Pathfinder to take a panoramic image.
VINCENT	Have you received it yet?
TIM	Yes, but I thought we would all rather look at this black screen instead of a vibrant red planet.
BRUCE	(off Vincent's look) Tim is our finest comm tech, and we all appreciate his acerbic wit.
TIM	Incoming.
VINCENT	Martian surface... more surface...
BRUCE	There's the Hab!
VINCENT	What's that?
VINCENT	"I'll write messages here. Are you receiving?"
VINCENT	"Point here for yes." "Point here for no."
TIM	Thirty-two minute round trip communications time. He can only ask yes/no questions, and all we can do is point the camera. This won't exactly be an Algonquin round table of snappy repartee.
BRUCE	Tim.
TIM	Roger that. Pointing the camera...
MARK	So here's the rub...
MARK	Somehow, we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera. From 1996. Luckily, the camera spins 360, so I can make an alphabet. I just can't use our alphabet. Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc. Too narrow. I wouldn't know what the camera was pointing at. So. Hexadecimals to the rescue...
VINCENT	We've been watching you since Sol 54...
TIM	"Glad to hear it. Really looking forward to not dying."
TIM	"How's the crew? What did they say when they found out I was alive?"
BRUCE	Tell him. Hm. Tell him...
TIM	He says... "They don't know I'm alive?
WHAT THE--"	"What the... f-word... f-word in gerund form... f-word again... is wrong with you... f-words."
VINCENT	Mark, please watch your language...
TEDDY	I just had to explain to the President of the United States what a "bureaucratic felcher" is.
MITCH	I made the mistake of typing it into Google. (off Teddy's look) Don't.	Problem is, Mark's right. This is only gonna get worse the longer we wait. We need to tell the crew.
TEDDY	You're bringing this up while Vincent's in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side.
MITCH	I shouldn't have to clear this with you or Vincent or anyone else.	It's time, Teddy.
LEWIS	Go ahead.
LEWIS	Copy. Coming to you.
LEWIS	You're in a hurry.
MARTINEZ	My son turned three yesterday. Should be some pics of the party.
JOHANSSEN	All right, we've got a batch of personals. Dispatching them to your laptops... I don't need to read Vogel's weird German fetish emails...
VOGEL	They are telemetry updates.
JOHANSSEN	Whatever does it for you. We've got a system update, I'll take care of that, and... huh. There's a voice message. Addressed to the whole crew.
LEWIS	Play it.
MITCH	Hermes, this is Mitch Henderson. I have some news. There's no subtle way to put this: Mark Watney is still alive.
MARTINEZ	He... He's alive?
VOGEL	Watney lives.
BECK	Holy shit. Commander! He's alive!
LEWIS	I left him behind.
JOHANSSEN	Commander... it wasn't...
BECK	We all left together.
LEWIS	You were following orders.	I left him behind.
MARK	Now that NASA can talk to me, they won't shut up...
MARK	They've got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops. Which is awesome. Look, I don't mean to sound arrogant here, but I'm the best botanist on the planet. So.
MARK	In other news, there's been a request for me to pose for a picture on the next transmission. I'm debating between "High School Senior..."
MARK	And "Coquettish Ingenue..."
MARK	But I'm not sure how that will translate with the spacesuit on.	One big bonus of this NASA communication: Email! Just like the days on the Hermes, I get data dumps. Not just friends and family, but NASA also sends choice messages from the public. Rock stars, athletes, even The President. The coolest one is from my alma mater, the University of Chicago. They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially "colonized" it. So, technically, I colonized Mars.	In your face, Neil Armstrong.
ANNIE	I ask for a picture and I get the goddamn Fonz?
VINCENT	Just be grateful you got something, Annie.
ANNIE	It's not gonna work. I need something with less-Happy-Days and more... Mark's face.
VINCENT	I could tell him to take his helmet off, but then he'd, you know, die.
TEDDY	Let's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation. I want to announce we're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window.
VINCENT	I'm on a plane to you this afternoon. We'll have the release ready.
TEDDY	Good, but Annie will handle camera appearances.
TEDDY	Bruce, is your team still on schedule?
BRUCE	It'll be tight. But we'll make it.
TEDDY	Nine-month travel time, that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868. Did we get the Botany Team's analysis?
VINCENT	They estimate Mark's crops will last him until Sol 912. They grudgingly admit Mark is doing great work.
MITCH	Grudgingly?
VINCENT	Mark has a tendency to tell them to have sex with themselves whenever they question one of his decisions.
TEDDY	Get him in line, Vincent. We can't afford any miscommunication. I hate this margin. 912 sols worth of food. We get there on 868. And that's assuming nothing goes wrong...
VINCENT	The crops are dead...
VINCENT	Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water.
VINCENT	Any bacteria that survived, died in the sub-zero temperatures when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.
ANNIE	How long does he have?
VINCENT	He can still eat the potatoes he has, he just can't grow any more. We estimate they'll give him about 200 sols.
TEDDY	And rations get him to what? Sol 409?
VINCENT	So with potatoes he can stretch to 609.
ANNIE	By Sol 868 he'll be long dead.
TEDDY	We're gonna have to launch as soon as possible. Which changes our travel time.
MITCH	We're working on it. Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip.
TEDDY	It's Sol 135 now. We need thirteen days to mount the boosters and perform inspections. Which gives Bruce and his team...	Forty-seven days to make this probe.
ANNIE	How long does it normally take?
VINCENT	Six months. Minimum.
TEDDY	I'm gonna let you call Bruce and give him the news.
BRUCE	Okay.	Okay.
BRUCE	I'm, uh... I'm gonna need a change of clothes. We're all gonna need a change of clothes.
MARTINEZ	"Dear Mark..."
MARTINEZ	"How's the Hermes? Cramped and claustrophobic? Every day I go outside and look at the vast horizons just because I can."	"Tell the others I said hello."
MIKE	Rich? Wake up. Sorry, they're asking for the probe courses.
RICH	What time is it?
MIKE	3:42.
MIKE	I know we're coming at this backwards, but we can't commit to a firm launch date with this many unknowns.
RICH	It's all right. All twenty-five models will take four-hundred fourteen days to reach Mars. They vary only slightly in thrust duration, and the fuel requirement is nearly identical.
MIKE	(looking at Rich's
CALCULATIONS)	Four-hundred fourteen days. Not an ideal time to launch, is it?
RICH	Earth and Mars are really badly positioned. Heck, it's almost easier to...
MIKE	Almost easier to what?
RICH	(lost in his head) I need more coffee...
MIKE	Almost easier to what?
MIKE	You understand I'm your boss, right?
VINCENT	"...the probe will take 414 days to reach you, and will deliver enough food to last you to Ares 4."
MINDY	Tell him about the name.
VINCENT	"We've officially named the probe `Iris'..."
TEDDY	Okay, let's ask the... (consults his files) Two hundred million dollar... sorry, five hundred... That's a "five?" (off their looks) Let's ask the very, very expensive question: is this probe gonna be ready on time?
BRUCE	We're behind.
TEDDY	Give me a number.
BRUCE	Fifteen days. If I had another fifteen days, I could get it done.
TEDDY	All right, let's create fifteen days. Thirteen days to mount the probe. Can we reduce?
VINCENT	It... actually only takes three days to mount it. We can get that down to two. But the other ten are for testing and inspections.
TEDDY	How often do those inspections reveal a problem?
MITCH	Are you suggesting we don't do the inspections?
TEDDY	Right now I'm asking how often they reveal a problem.
VINCENT	About one in twenty launches. But that's grounds for a countdown halt. We can't take that chance.
TEDDY	Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time?
TEDDY	Tell Dr. Keller to stretch Watney's rations four more days. She won't like it, but that'll get us to fifteen. And we'll cancel the inspections.
VINCENT	Teddy...
TEDDY	It's on me, Vincent.	You've got your two weeks. Get it done.
MARK	So. I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food. And this is what "minimal calorie count" looks like. (holds up the pack) Standard issue ration. But instead of three every one day, I'm now eating one every three days.	Oh good. Meatloaf.
MARK	This is today's allotment. Which I will supplement with potatoes. Which I am beginning to hate with the fiery passion of a thousand suns. And now I've been told to do this.
MARK	The point is, "Stretch the rations four more days" is a real dick-punch.
MARK	I'm dipping this potato in Vicodin and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
MITCH	Do you believe in God, Vincent?
VINCENT	Several. My mother's Catholic and my father's Hindu.
MITCH	We'll take all the help we can get.
MITCH	This is the Flight Director. Begin Launch Status Check.
LAUNCHER INTERFACE	Getting a little shimmy, Flight.
MITCH	Say again?
LAUNCHER INTERFACE	Whoa! Flight, we're getting a large precession!
GUIDANCE TELEMETRY
MITCH	Launch, what's happening?
LAUNCHER INTERFACE	It's spinning on the long axis with a 17 degree precession.
COMMS	We've lost readings on the probe, Flight.
MITCH	Shit. It shook loose in the bay.
LAUNCHER INTERFACE	Loss of signal, Flight.
GUIDANCE TELEMETRY
MITCH	SatCon?
SATCON	No satellite acquisition of signal.
CAPCOM	Flight, US Destroyer Stockton reports debris falling from sky.
MITCH	Roger.
MITCH	GC, Flight. Lock the doors.
	Tell them I said I can live with that.
VINCENT	...we substituted protein cubes for the standard rations. The thrust of the launch, combined with the simultaneous lateral vibration, liquefied the cubes and created an unbalanced load.
REPORTER 4	Why wasn't this accounted for in the inspection phase?
TEDDY	In order to make our launch window, we were forced to accelerate our schedule.
REPORTER 4	You skipped the inspections?
TEDDY	Yes.
VOICE	Their astronaut is going to die.
ZHU	Perhaps. Perhaps not. (hands Guo the brief) The Taiyang Shen's booster. Our engineers have run the numbers, and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit.
GUO	(are you kidding?) Why hasn't NASA approached us?
ZHU	They don't know. Our booster technology is classified.
GUO	So if we do nothing...
ZHU	The world would never know we could have helped.
GUO	Then. Merely for the sake of argument, let's say we decide to help them...
ZHU	We'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen.
GUO	We need to keep this among scientists. A cooperation between space agencies...
TEDDY	Yes.
BRUCE	All right, thanks to our friends in China, we get one more chance at this. We finished the Iris probe in sixty-three days. Now we get to do it again in twenty-eight...
VINCENT	We're jettisoning any sort of landing system -- the idea is we're only sending rations, so they can crash land on Mars...
SECRETARY
WAIT --
RICH	You should hang up the phone.
VINCENT	I'm sorry -- who are you?
RICH	My name is Rich Purnell and I work in astrodynamics and you should hang up the phone right now.
VINCENT	I'll call you back.
ANNIE	What the hell is "Project Elrond?"
VINCENT	I had to make something up.
ANNIE	"Elrond?"
MITCH	Because it's a secret meeting.
ANNIE	How do you know that? Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting?"
BRUCE	The Council of Elrond. From Lord of the Rings. It's the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring.
ANNIE	I so quit right now.
TEDDY	If we're calling something Project Elrond, I would like my codename to be "Glorfindel."
ANNIE	Oh my god I hate every one of you.
MITCH	Teddy doesn't even know what this is about?
VINCENT	Tell them exactly what you told me.
RICH	I can get the Hermes back to Mars by Sol
MITCH	What?
TEDDY	How?
RICH	Okay... let's pretend this stapler is the Hermes. And you are... I'm sorry, what's your name again?
TEDDY	Teddy.	I'm the Director of NASA.
RICH	Okay, Teddy, you're Earth. And right now the Hermes is heading towards you and is about to start its month-long deceleration to intercept. But, instead, I'm proposing...	We start accelerating immediately, to preserve velocity and gain even more. We don't intercept Earth at all, but we come close enough to use a gravity assist to adjust course. While we're doing that...
RICH	We resupply with the probe --
VINCENT	The Taiyeng Shen.
RICH	Pick up whatever provisions we need... and then we're accelerating towards Mars.	You're Mars. And we're going too fast at this point to fall into orbit, so it's a flyby.
BRUCE	What good is a flyby if we can't get Watney off the surface?
VINCENT	Watney would have to intercept using the
RICH	And we head back home. I've done the math. It checks out.
TEDDY	Rich?
RICH	Yes sir?
TEDDY	Get out.
TEDDY	Is he right?
VINCENT	I believe so.
TEDDY	And we need to use the Taiyeng Shen?
VINCENT	Yes.
ANNIE	What am I missing? Why is that important?
VINCENT	Because we can only do one.
TEDDY	Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4, or send Hermes back to get him right now.
VINCENT	Both plans require the Taiyang Shen, so we have to choose.
ANNIE	What about the Hermes crew? We'd be asking them to add... (does the math) 533 days to their mission.
MITCH	They wouldn't hesitate. Not for a second. That's why Vincent called this meeting. He wants us to decide instead.
MITCH	Bullshit. It should be Commander Lewis' call.
VINCENT	It's a matter of life and death, Mitch. We need to make this decision.
MITCH	She's the Mission Commander. Life and death decisions are her damn job.
TEDDY	Can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission end?
VINCENT	It should. The Hermes was made to do all five Ares missions, so it's only halfway through lifespan.
ANNIE	But if something went wrong...
VINCENT	We would lose the crew. And the Ares Program with them.
BRUCE	So... what? We either have a high chance of killing one person, or a low chance of killing six people. How do we make that decision?
VINCENT	We don't. Teddy does.
TEDDY	We still have the chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound. I'm not risking their lives.
MITCH	Let them make that decision.
TEDDY	Mitch. We're going with option one.
MITCH	You goddamn coward.
MINDY	He's been doing EVAs throughout the day.
MINDY	There's a pattern to them. He goes out three hundred meters. Then stops. Three hundred more meters. Then stops.
VINCENT	And nobody gave him instructions? Did JPL schedule something?
MINDY	He's at the Rover.	We're receiving a transmission.
MINDY	"Chem analysis... sample batch 1A-7C..."
VINCENT	Commander Lewis' geo-compositing experiments.
VINCENT	He's finishing the mission.
MARK	We evac'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission... Which means we've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules. For each of us. So. Commander Lewis... your work's in good hands. Beck -- I'll be honest with you, I don't understand chemolithotrophic detection. At all. But I'm doing my best. Johanssen, I know you don't like it when I touch the ChemCam, but guess what? I'm touching the ChemCam. Vogel, I think I've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I've titled "Das Core Samples" out of respect for the Fatherland. And Martinez... I still don't know what it is you do. Why did we bring you? No idea.	I'm trying to keep everything documented and organized.
MARK	I know that's not exactly my strong suit, but I want it all to make sense, in case... you know. Maybe you can teach it in class someday. The Watney Syllabus. "How to Make a Bathtub Using NASA Tubing and an Old RTG." "How to Cook a Potato Six-Thousand Different Ways." "How to Make Water Out of Rocket Fuel. To Keep You Alive. For Just A Little Longer."
VOGEL	I have a problem.
VOGEL	It's an email from my wife. The subject line says "Our Children," but the computer won't open the attachment.
JOHANSSEN	Let's take a look. (as she works) Huh. This isn't a jpg. It's a plain ASCII text file. Looks like... I don't know what this looks like. Math equations. Does this make any sense to you?
VOGEL	"Rich Purnell Maneuver." Ja. It is a course maneuver for the Hermes...
VOGEL	Mein Gott.
LEWIS	...and the mission would conclude with Earth intercept 211 days later.
MARTINEZ	Would this really work?
LEWIS	We ran the numbers. They check out.
VOGEL	It's a brilliant course.
BECK	Why all the cloak and dagger?
LEWIS	NASA rejected the idea. They'd rather take a big risk on Watney than a small risk on all of us. Whoever snuck it in Vogel's email obviously disagreed.
MARTINEZ	So. We're talking about going directly against NASA's decision?
LEWIS	Yes. If we do the maneuver, they'll have to send the supply ship or we'll die. We have the opportunity to force their hand.
JOHANSSEN	Are we gonna do it?
LEWIS	If it were up to me, we'd already be on our way.
MARTINEZ	Isn't it? Up to you, I mean.
LEWIS	Not this time. This is something NASA expressly rejected. We're talking about mutiny. Which is not a word I use lightly. We do this together, or not at all. Before you answer, consider the consequences. If we mess up the supply rendezvous, we die. If we mess up the Earth gravity assist, we die. If we do everything perfectly, we add 533 days to our mission. 533 more days before we see our families again. 533 days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong. Something might break that we can't fix. If it's mission critical, we die.
MARTINEZ	Sign me up.
LEWIS	Easy, cowboy. You and I are military. There's a good chance we'd be court- martialed when we got home. As for the rest of you, I guarantee they'll never send you up again.
BECK	If we go for it... how would it work?
VOGEL	I plot the course and execute it.
JOHANSSEN	Remote Override. They can take over the Hermes from Mission Control.
LEWIS	Can you disable it?
JOHANSSEN	Hermes has four redundant flight computers, each connected to three redundant comm systems. We can't shut down the comms; we'd lose telemetry and guidance. We can't shut down the computers; we need to control the ship. I'd have to disable the Remote Override on each system... It's part of the OS, I'd have to jump over the code...
BECK	Johanssen used to go by the hacker handle "Lady Sorrow" in high school. Just so we're all on the same page.
JOHANSSEN	Beck is a liar. And he should keep our conversations private.	But, yeah. I can do it.
LEWIS	It has to be unanimous. If anyone says no, that's it. We go home as planned. But I vote yes.
MARTINEZ	I vote yes.
VOGEL	If we do this, it would be over nine hundred days of space. That is enough space for one life.	Yes.
BECK	Let's go get him.
LEWIS	Johanssen?
CAPCOM	Flight, CAPCOM.
BRENDAN	Go CAPCOM.
CAPCOM	Unscheduled status update from Hermes.
BRENDAN	Roger. Read it out.
CAPCOM	I...I don't get it, Flight. No real status. Just a single sentence.
BRENDAN	What's it say?
CAPCOM	Message reads: "Houston, be advised: Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man."
BRENDAN	What? Who the hell is Rich Purnell?
GUIDANCE	Flight, Guidance.
BRENDAN	Go Guidance.
GUIDANCE	Hermes is off-course.
BRENDAN	CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting. Guidance, get a correction ready --
GUIDANCE	Negative, Flight. It's not drift, they've adjusted course. Deliberate 27.812 rotation.
BRENDAN	What the hell? CAPCOM, ask them what the hell.
CAPCOM	Roger Flight. Message sent. Minimum reply time 3 minutes, 4 seconds.
BRENDAN	Telemetry, any chance this is instrumentation failure?
TELEMETRY	Negative, Flight.
BRENDAN	Oh god. Guidance, Flight.
GUIDANCE	Go Flight.
BRENDAN	Work out how long they can stay on this course before it's irreversible.
GUIDANCE	Working on that now, Flight.
BRENDAN	And somebody find out who the hell Rich Purnell is!
TEDDY	Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars.
MITCH	That seems like the smart move. Considering the circumstances.
TEDDY	You may have killed the whole crew.
MITCH	Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information. The crew made the decision on their own.
TEDDY	We're fighting the same war. Every time something goes wrong, the world forgets why we fly. I'm trying to keep us airborne. This is bigger than one person.
MITCH	No. It's not.
TEDDY	When this is over... I'll expect your resignation.
MITCH	(a beat; then) I understand.
TEDDY	(we're finished here) Bring our astronauts home.
MARK	Every Ares mission requires three years of presupplies...
MARK	...so NASA figured out it's a lot easier to ship some of this stuff ahead of time rather than bring it with us. So, as a result, the MAV for Ares-4 is already waiting at the Schiaparelli Crater. And the plan is to use it to launch me into orbit just as the Hermes is passing. And then, I guess... they catch me? In space.
MARK	Anyway, that's not really my problem right now. First, I have to get there. And it's 3,200 kilometers away. So I have 200 sols to figure out how to bring everything here that's keeping me alive -- the Atmospheric Regulator, the Oxygenator, and the Water Reclaimer -- along for the ride. Luckily, I have the brainpower of the entire planet Earth helping me with this endeavor. So far we've come up with, "Drill holes in the roof of your rover and then hit it with a rock."	We'll get there.
MARISSA	Five hundred and thirty-three days longer? And you said yes to this?
MARTINEZ	I did. He would have done the same for me. You know that.
MARISSA	And you think I'm gonna forgive you?
MARTINEZ	I do.
ROBERT	I found it at the flea market. Original. Pressing.
MITCH	All due respect to your CNSA protocol, we haven't done things that way since Apollo
9 --
MARK	I've been thinking about laws on Mars...
MARK	There's an international treaty saying no country can lay claim to anything that's not on Earth.
MARK	NASA is an American non-military organization, and it owns the Hab. So, as soon as I step outside, I'm in international waters.
MARK	Here's the cool part. I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater, where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander. Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this, and they can't until I'm aboard the Ares 4. So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission. Which, by definition, makes me a pirate.	Mark Watney, Space Pirate.	I'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet.
VINCENT	How's our boy doing?
MINDY	So far, so good. He's sticking to schedule. Drives for four hours before noon. Then sets the solar panels. And waits thirteen hours while they recharge. Sleeps somewhere in there. Then starts again.
VINCENT	How's his morale?
MINDY	He's asked us to call him "Captain Blondebeard."
VINCENT	(thinks about that... huh) Mars would be governed by maritime law, so technically --
MINDY	Yeah, he explained it to us.
BRUCE	Okay, we're gonna start by stating, for the record, that you're not gonna like this.
MITCH	The problem is the intercept velocity. The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit, or they'll never have enough fuel to make it home. The MAV is only designed to get to Low Mars Orbit. So in order for Mark to escape Mars' gravity entirely and intercept the Hermes...
VINCENT	He needs to be going fast.
BRUCE	Which means we need to make the MAV lighter. A lot lighter. Five-thousand kilograms lighter.
VINCENT	You can do that?
BRUCE	There were some gimmes right off the bat. The design presumes 500 kilograms of Martian soil and samples. Obviously, we won't do that.
MITCH	There's just one passenger instead of six. With suits and gear, that saves another 500. Then we ditch the life support. We don't need it. We'll have Watney use his EVA suit for the whole trip.
VINCENT	How will he use the controls?
MITCH	He won't. Martinez will pilot the MAV remotely from the Hermes.
VINCENT	We've never had a manned ship controlled remotely before. (off Mitch's look) But... I'm excited for the opportunities that affords.
BRUCE	If we go remote, we can lose the control panels. Then we dump the secondary and tertiary comm systems.
VINCENT	You're going to have a remote controlled ascent with no backup comms?
MITCH	He's not even to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.
VINCENT	You better skip to the bad stuff.
BRUCE	We have to remove the nose airlock, the windows, and Hull Panel 19.
VINCENT	(what?) You're taking the front of the ship off?
BRUCE	Sure. The nose airlock alone is 400 kilograms.
VINCENT	You're going to launch a man into space with a giant hole in the front of the ship?
BRUCE	Well... no. We're gonna have him cover it with Hab canvas.
BRUCE	The hull's mostly there to keep the air in. Mars' atmosphere is so thin you don't need a lot of streamlining. By the time the ship's going fast enough for air resistance to matter, it'll be high enough that there's practically no air.
VINCENT	You're sending him to space under a tarp.
BRUCE	Yes. Can I go on?
VINCENT	I'm not really sure I want you to, but okay.
MINDY	Mark says... "Are you f-word-ing kidding me?"
VINCENT	Do you think he meant it like...	"Are you kidding me?" Or more...	"Are you kidding me?"
MINDY	(doesn't want to hurt
VINCENT'S FEELINGS)	It's... possible he meant it the first way?
MARK	I know what they're doing. I know what they're doing. They keep repeating "accelerate faster than any man in the history of space travel" like this is a good thing, like this'll distract me from how insane their plan is. Oh really? I get to be the fastest man in the history of space travel? You're launching me into space in a convertible. No no, it's worse, because I don't have any controls. You're launching me into space in a tin can. And, by the way, physicists don't even use words like "fast" when describing acceleration, so they're only doing it in hopes I won't raise any objections because I like the way "fastest man in the history of space travel" sounds. Well, you know what?
MARK	(thinks about it) I do like it. I do like the way it sounds.	Okay, fine. Let's do this.
JOHANSSEN	And... you killed him.
LEWIS	Try it again.
LEWIS	Here's the plan...
LEWIS	Martinez will fly the MAV. Johanssen will sysop the ascent. Beck and Vogel, I want you in Airlock 2 with the outer door open before the MAV even launches. Once we reach intercept, it'll be Beck's job to get Watney.
BECK	He might be in bad shape. The stripped down MAV will get up to 12 g's during the launch. He could be knocked unconscious and may have internal bleeding.
LEWIS	Well, then it's a good thing you're our doctor. What's the intercept plan?
BECK	We finished attaching the tethers into one long line. It's 214 meters long. I'll have the MMU, so moving around should be easy.
LEWIS	How fast a relative velocity can you handle?
BECK	Once I get to Mark? I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second. 10 is like jumping onto a moving train. Any more than that and I might miss.
LEWIS	We've got some leeway. The launch will be 52 minutes before the intercept and it takes 12 minutes. As soon as Mark's engine cuts out we'll know our intercept point and velocity.
BECK	Good. And 214 meters isn't a hard limit, per se.
LEWIS	Yes. It is.
BECK	I take off the tether, I could get way out to --
LEWIS	Not an option. Vogel, you're Beck's backup. All goes well, you're pulling them back aboard with the tether. If things go wrong, you're going out after them.
VOGEL	Ja.
LEWIS	All right. Let's go get our boy.
ANNIE	If something goes wrong, what can Mission Control do?
VINCENT	Not a damned thing. (off her look) It's all happening twelve light-minutes away. That means it takes twenty-four minutes for them to get the answer to any question they ask. The whole launch is twelve minutes long. They're on their own.
ANNIE	Not that we have a choice, but... are we sure we want to be broadcasting this to the world? I mean, if something goes
WRONG --
VINCENT	(cutting her off) Yes.
VINCENT	We want to be broadcasting this.
LEWIS	About two minutes, Watney. How you doing down there?
MARK	It's good to hear your voice, Commander. I'm eager to get up to you.
MARK	Thank you for coming back for me.
LEWIS	We're on the case. Remember, you'll be pulling some pretty heavy G's. It's okay to pass out. You're in Martinez' hands.
MARK	Tell that asshole no barrel-rolls.
LEWIS	Copy that, MAV. CAPCOM...
JOHANSSEN	Go.
LEWIS	Remote Command...
MARTINEZ	Go.
LEWIS	Recovery...
BECK	Go.
VOGEL	Go.
LEWIS	Pilot...
MARK	Go.
MARTINEZ	Main engines start.
JOHANSSEN	8... 7... mooring clamps released...
LEWIS	About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.
MARK	See you in a few, Commander.
JOHANSSEN	Velocity 741 meters per second. Altitude 1350 meters...
LEWIS	That's too low --
MARTINEZ	I know. It's fighting me --
JOHANSSEN	Velocity 850, altitude 1843 --
LEWIS	Watney? Watney, do you read? Can you report?
JOHANSSEN	He's well below target altitude.
LEWIS	How far below?
JOHANSSEN	Working on it -- Main shutdown in 3... 2... 1... Shutdown.
MARTINEZ	Back to automatic guidance. Confirm shutdown.
LEWIS	Watney? Do you read?
LEWIS	Copy.
JOHANSSEN	I have interval pings. Intercept velocity will be 11 meters per second...
JOHANSSEN	Distance at intercept will be --	We'll be 68 kilometers apart.
BECK	Did she say 68 kilometers? Kilometers?
MARTINEZ	Oh my god...
LEWIS	Keep it together. Work the problem. Martinez, do we have any juice in the
MARTINEZ	Negative, Commander. They ditched the OMS system to make launch weight.
LEWIS	Then we have to go him. Johanssen, time to intercept?
JOHANSSEN	39 minutes, 12 seconds --
LEWIS	What if we point our attitude thrusters all the same direction?
MARTINEZ	Depends on how much fuel we want to save for attitude adjustments on the trip home.
LEWIS	How much do you need?
MARTINEZ	I could get by with maybe 20 percent of what's left.
LEWIS
JOHANSSEN --
JOHANSSEN	(already working it) Use 75.5 percent of remaining attitude adjust fuel. That'll bring the intercept range to zero.
LEWIS	Do it.
JOHANSSEN	Hang on -- that gets the range to zero, but the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second --
LEWIS	Then we have 39 minutes to figure out how to slow down. Martinez, burn the jets.
MARK	MAV to Hermes --
MARK	Affirmative, Commander.
MARK	My chest hurts. I think I broke some ribs.	How are you?
MARK	Yeah. The canvas didn't hold...
LEWIS	That's consistent with what we saw.
LEWIS	We've corrected the intercept range, but we've got a problem with the intercept velocity.
LEWIS	42 meters per second.
MARK	Well. Shit.
MARK	I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly my way to you. Since the source is on my arm, I could direct it pretty easy.
LEWIS	I can't see you having any control if you did that. You'd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control.
CONSIDER THIS:
MARK	I would get to fly around like Iron Man.
LEWIS	We should have left him on Mars.
LEWIS	Maybe it's not the worst idea.
MARTINEZ	No, it actually is. The worst idea. Ever.
LEWIS	Not his part. But using atmosphere as thrust... (springs into action) Martinez, get Vogel's station up and running...
MARTINEZ	It's up. What do you need?
LEWIS	I need to know what happens if we blow the VAL.
MARTINEZ	You want to open the Vehicular Airlock?
LEWIS	It would give us a good kick.
MARTINEZ	Yeah. And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process.
JOHANSSEN	And... all the air would leave. And we need air. To not die.
LEWIS	We'll seal the bridge and reactor room. We let everywhere else go vacuo.
MARTINEZ	But we'd still have the same problem as Watney. We can't direct the thrust.
LEWIS	We don't have to. The VAL is in the nose. We just point the ship at Mark.
MARTINEZ	(reading the numbers) A breach at the VAL would decelerate us 29 meters per second.
JOHANSSEN	Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second.
LEWIS	Beck -- you hearing this?
MARTINEZ	How do we open the airlock doors? There's no way to open them remotely, and if anyone's nearby when it blows...
LEWIS	Right... right...	Vogel?
LEWIS	Take your suit off.	I need you to come back in and make a bomb.
MARK	Did you say "bomb?" You guys are making a bomb without me?
VOGEL	Um... Again, please, Commander.
VOGEL	Probably. But... I feel obliged to mention that setting off an explosive device on a spacecraft is a terrible, terrible idea.
VOGEL	Ja.
LEWIS	Beck -- leave your suit on. Meet Johanssen at Airlock 1. We'll open the outer door. I need you to place the charge on the inner door...
BECK	Copy. On my way.
MARK	Commander, I can't let you guys do this. I'm ready to puncture the suit. Let's go with the Iron Man plan.
LEWIS	Absolutely not.
MARK	The thing is, I'm selfish. And I want the memorials back home to be just me. I don't want the rest of you losers in them.	Commander... call it off.
LEWIS	Oh. Okay. Well, if you want us to call it off, then I guess we have to oh wait... wait a minute. Yep. I'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out I'm Commander. So shut up.
MARK	Smart ass.
JOHANSSEN	Bomb?
VOGEL	Bomb. In a pure oxygen environment, 16.7 million Joules will be released for every kilogram of sugar used. Eight times more powerful than a stick of dynamite.
JOHANSSEN	How do we activate it?
VOGEL	Can you run this to one of our lighting panels?
JOHANSSEN	Make sure you're not still here when this goes off.
JOHANSSEN
WAIT --
JOHANSSEN	Be careful. Out in space.
JOHANSSEN	Don't tell anyone I did that.
BECK	Bomb is set. On my way.
MARTINEZ	Guys, I'm running the numbers -- even with optimal VAL blow, we're gonna be off on our angle.
LEWIS	What's the new intercept distance?	Johanssen.
JOHANSSEN	260 meters. Approximate.
LEWIS	That's too far...
MARTINEZ	Commander?
LEWIS	The intercept distance is gonna be too far. I'm going untethered.
BECK	Commander, I can do this --
LEWIS	It's not a debate, Beck. I'm not risking another crew member.
LEWIS	Johanssen, time to VAL blow?
LEWIS	We sure know how to cut it close.
JOHANSSEN	10 seconds...
MARTINEZ	Strap in.
JOHANSSEN	5... 4... 3...
LEWIS	Brace for deceleration.
JOHANSSEN	2... 1... Activating Panel 41.
JOHANSSEN	Bridge seal holding.
MARTINEZ	Damage?
LEWIS	Copy.
JOHANSSEN	312 meters.
MARK	You said 312? Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.
LEWIS	Mark -- you're still WAY TOO FAR -- I'm not gonna make it --
MARK	Commander. Seriously.	I got this.
MARK	(having the time of his
LIFE)	I have visual on the Commander.
LEWIS	Johanssen -- what's my relative velocity to Mark?
JOHANSSEN	5.2 meters per second...
JOHANSSEN	3.1 meters per second...
MARK	Contact.
MARK	You have terrible taste in music.
MARK	Hi guys.
JOHANSSEN	Oh, hey Mark. Haven't seen you in a while.
MARTINEZ	Yeah. What've you been up to?
MARK	Oh. You know. Same old, same old.
VOGEL	You smell horrible.
MARK	I haven't showered in a year and a half. Cut me some slack.
JOHANSSEN	You don't know what you're asking us here.
MARTINEZ	Yeah, captain, we may need to put him back.
MARK	I missed you guys.
MARK	Welcome to the Astronaut Candidate Program. Pay attention. This could save your life.	Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
MARK	Okay, let's see if I can get some of your questions out of the way up front. Yes, I did, indeed, survive on a deserted planet by farming in my own shit. It was even more disgusting than it sounds. Let's never speak of it again.
MARK	Question Two: "When you were stranded and alone up there... did you think you were gonna die?"
MARK	Yes.
MARK	And it'll happen to you, too. You should know that going in. It's space. It's filled with chance, circumstance, and bad luck. It doesn't cooperate. At some point, I promise, at some point every single thing is gonna go south on you, and you'll think: this is it. This is how I end.	And you can either accept that... or you can get to work.
MARK	That's all it is. You simply begin. Solve one problem. Then the next one, then the next.	You solve enough problems... and you get to come home.
MARK	All right. Questions?
ANNIE	...as soon as Mission Control finishes their pre-flight checks, we will begin launch procedures...
ANNIE	The Ares 5 team will rendezvous with the Hermes approximately 48 minutes after launch. From there, they've got 414 days of space travel ahead of them, arriving at Mars on March 30th. And I'll let the Director of Mars Missions, Vincent Kapoor, brief you on the particulars.
VINCENT	Good morning. Their mission is scheduled for 41 Sols. Your briefs detail the research and experiment schedules...
MINDY	Flight, CAPCOM. Ready to begin preflight check.
BRENDAN	Go ahead, CAPCOM.
WEN	Go.
