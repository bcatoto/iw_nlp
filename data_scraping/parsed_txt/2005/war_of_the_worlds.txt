War of the Worlds

NARRATOR	No one would have believed in the early  years of the21st century, that our world  was being watched by intelligences greater  than our own. That as men busied themselves  about their various concerns, they observed  and studied. Like the way a man with  a microscope might scrutinize the creatures  that swarm and multiply in a drop of  water. With infinite complacency men  went to and fro about the globe, confident  of our empire over this world. Yet,  across the gulf of space, intellects,  vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded  our plant with envious eyes. And slowly  and surely, drew their plans against  us.
SAL	Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!
SAL	I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00  I got half of Korea coming in.
RAY	No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour  blow! Call Tadesko.
SAL	Tadesko can't move 40 containers in  an hour. I need somebody who can do  double picks.
RAY	I wish I could help you Sal. God damn  union regulations.
SAL	(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position  here!
RAY	Come on, you remember the union regulations,  Sal.
SAL	(angrily) You know what your problem  is?
RAY	(joking) I can think of a couple of  women who'd be happy to tell you.
RAY	Is it 8:30? We say that?
MARY ANN	We said 8:00.
RAY	(changing subject) Hey, this is one  safe looking vehicle you got yourself  here Tim. Congratulations.
TIM	Thank You.
RAY	8 o'clock huh?
MARY ANN	Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday,  depending on the traffic.
RAY	There he is! You got a hug?
RAY	(continues) Confusing handshake? (joking)  Kick in the teeth? The door's locked.  (to Mary Ann): Still working on those  manners?
RACHEL	Hello dad.
RAY	Hello, Rachel!
ROBBIE	(during bickering, at the front door)  The door's locked.
MARY ANN	(suit case in hand) I'll just get it  in the door.
RACHEL	It's got rollers, just roll it.
MARY ANN	Well we can't roll it up the stairs  now can we?
RAY	Really, I got it from here, okay?
RAY	(to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be  out of here next week.
RAY	(trying to get her to leave) You better  get going if you want to beat the traffic,  don't you think?
MARY ANN	You're out of milk. (smells it) And  everything else.
RAY	(mad) Would you close the door please?  Now that that's my refrigerator.
TIM	I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel)  I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see  you in a few days.
RACHEL	Bye Tim.
MARY ANN	I'd better get this upstairs.
RACHEL	(trying to get her bag form Mary Ann)  Mom, Mom!
RAY	Mary Ann, let me get this.
MARY ANN	I can get it.
RAY	(rushes to close his bedroom door, as  if hiding something) Excuse me.
MARY ANN	A little old to still be sharing aren't  they?
RAY	I don't hear any complaints.
MARY ANN	No, I do.
MARY ANN	Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie  to make sure he's listening) ...on the  French occupation of Algeria due Monday  which he's yet to begin. It would be  nice if he were done by the time we  got back so we don't have to keep him  up all night on Sunday.
ROBBIE	I just got to type it up. (makes typing  motion)
MARY ANN	No, you just got to start writing it  first.
ROBBIE	(interrupts her) I love you mom!
MARY ANN	I love you. (begins walking over to  Rachel) Listen to your father.
MARY ANN	Oh, no shoes on the bed.
MARY ANN	We'll be at my parent's house in Boston  but don't call the house line, because  you know. Well the point is I've got  my cell phone. So if anything comes  up, or if you have any questions just  call.
RAY	Believe it or not, I can handle it.
MARY ANN	I'll leave the phone on.
RAY	Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for  you.
MARY ANN	You think?
RAY	Yeah.
MARY ANN	Take care of our kids.
RAY	Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about.  Listen, you tell your mother that Ray  sends his love and kisses.
MARY ANN	(laughs) She'll love that.
ROBBIE	Baseball season's over.
RAY	Five minutes. It's not going to kill  you.
RAY	There he is. (Robbie puts on his new  cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how  it is? (no response from Robbie) That's  how it's gonna be?
RAY	Careful with that throw.
ROBBIE	Whatever Ray!
RAY	Your mom says you've got a report due  on Monday, so you are going to work  on that when you're done here.
ROBBIE	Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got  to type it up.
RAY	Yeah, bullshit!
ROBBIE	Yeah, and what do you know Ray?
RAY	Everything. Haven't you heard? Between  me and my brother, we know everything.
RACHEL	What's the capital of Australia?
RAY	That's one my brother knows.
ROBBIE	Is it okay with you if I just laugh  the first 500 times you tell that one.
RAY	Just do your report. We don't send you  to school so you can flunk out.
ROBBIE	You don't pay for it, Tim does.
RAY	That's half of what I've got.
ROBBIE	You're an asshole. I hate coming here.
RAY	That why you act like such a dick?
RAY	What?
RACHEL	That's not how you're going to get through  to him. You want him to listen to you...
RAY	(interrupts her) What are you? Your  mother or mine?
RACHEL	Where are you going?
RAY	To sleep. I work for a living.
RACHEL	What are we supposed to eat?
RAY	You know, order.
RAY	What's the matter?
RACHEL	I got a splinter.
RAY	Where'd you get it. Come here.
RACHEL	On your porch railing.
RAY	What, you want me to... (beat) You want  me to take that out for you?
RACHEL	Absolutely not!
RAY	Well, come here let me see it.
RAY	It's gonna get infected.
RACHEL	No it wont.
RAY	Yes, it's gonna get infected.
RACHEL	No, it won't. When it's ready, my body  will just push it out.
RAY	Push it out?
RACHEL	I read that. (as she sits back down)  You should get TiVo. Tim got it for  my room. It's awesome. I can watch all  my shows after homework.
RAY	Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum  card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?
RAY	(with the disgusting food in his mouth)  What is that?
RACHEL	Hummus.
RAY	Hummus?
RACHEL	From the health food place. I kept one  of their menus last time we were here.
RACHEL	Uh, you said order!
RAY	(laughs) I meant order food! Where is  Robbie?
RACHEL	He went out.
RAY	Out where?
RACHEL	I don't know. He just took your car  and left.
FRIEND 1	You ever see something like that?
RAY	(scratching his chin) In the springtime  maybe. Not this time of year. Come on,  we can see better from the back yard.
RAY	That is so weird.
FRIEND 2	What?
RAY	The wind is blowing toward the storm.
FRIEND 2	That is weird.
RAY	Rachel, wanna see something cool?
RAY	It's okay.
RACHEL	I want to go inside.
RAY	It's okay.
RACHEL	I want to go inside.
RAY	Okay, you go ahead.
FRIEND 2	That's enough weather for me. (begins  walking inside)
RACHEL	I don't want to go by myself.
RAY	Kind of fun, ain't it?
RACHEL	No.
RAY	Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of  July.
RACHEL	No it's not.
RAY	It's okay. You're fine.
RACHEL	It hit right behind our house.
RAY	Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there  again because lighting doesn't strike  twice in the same place.
RAY	Oh, SHIT!
RACHEL	Where's Robbie?
RAY	I don't know.
RACHEL	Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you  okay?
RAY	Where's the thunder?
RACHEL	Why won't it stop?
RACHEL	(with hesitation) Is it over?
RACHEL	Where are you going?
RAY	Just checking things out. Just wait,  wait there.
RACHEL	Are we going to be okay?
RAY	I don't know.
RACHEL	You don't know.
RAY	No. I meant... Rachel, please, just  stop asking so many questions. Just  wait here.
FRIEND 2	You believe this Ray? Every single car.
RAY	(worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
ROBBIE	The car just stopped and...
RAY	(interrupts him) You're okay? Are you  okay?
ROBBIE	... and the lighting started hitting  about a block away over and over again.  And me and this other guy we...
RAY	(getting angry) Where the hell'd you  go?
ROBBIE	Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ...  by the church.
RAY	Did you see it? Did you... Were you  near it?
ROBBIE	Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and  over the lighting started hitting. It  opened up this hole or something...
RAY	26 times?
ROBBIE	Yeah.
RAY	Okay, well, you're okay?
ROBBIE	Yeah.
RAY	Good, because your sister is in the  house, I want you to go in that house  and I want you to stay with her. Okay?  (break, as he starts running down the  street) And the next time you take my  car with no driver's license and no  permission, I call the cops. You better  be there when I get back.
RAY	Robbie. (snaps his hands together)
RAY	Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it,  dead?
MANNY	All of them, everything, look at this...  (taps the starter motor) starter's fried.
RAY	Lightning hit it?
MANNY	Not even close. I thought if I changed  it... you got any idea what's going  on?
RAY	I'm on my way to find out. Try umm...  try changing the solenoids.
MANNY	Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right  see, I told you that, the solenoids.
COP 1	Let us through. Let us through here.
FRIEND 3	Hey, what up, Ray?
RAY	(joking) I should of known you two were  behind this.
FRIEND 3	Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor  hood
RAY	Can you blame him?
FRIEND 4	You see it?
RAY	Yep, you got power where you are?
FRIEND 3	Nope, nothing.
RAY	It's the cars though. That's the thing.
FRIEND 4	Solar Flare, that's what this guy told  me.
RAY	A solar flare?
FRIEND 4	Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma,  they turn into solar flare flashes.  It's the only thing that can kill all  of the electronic stuff.
FRIEND 3	Can I say something?
FRIEND 4	What bro?
FRIEND 3	The sun does not cause lightning, okay?
FRIEND 4	Bro, I'm just telling you what that  guy said he heard.
FRIEND 3	I know but it just sounds dumb saying  that...
COP 1	I never seen anything like this before.  That many strikes of lighting in one  spot.
RAY	Is this the only place?
FRIEND 4	Is it hot?
RAY	No. It's freezing.
COP 2	What is that?
RAY	You feel that?
FRIEND 3	Yeah, I feel that.
FRIEND 4	What is it the subway?
COP 1	There's no subway here.
FRIEND 4	PATH Train maybe?
COP 1	That can't be the water main.
COP 2	There's nothing else down there.
COP 1	The water main doesn't run through here.
COP 2	Well, there's something down there and  it's moving.
FRIEND 4	Oh my god.
FRIEND 4	Ray, no, stay man.
ROBBIE	What happened?
RACHEL	What's going on?
RACHEL	Dad, what's the matter?
ROBBIE	What's all that stuff all over you?
RACHEL	What's all the stuff?
ROBBIE	Hello? Ray?
RAY	We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.
ROBBIE	(questioning) What? Wait. I have no  idea what's going on...
RAY	(while Robbie asks) ... all the food  from the refrigerator and the cupboard,  put it in here.
ROBBIE	I think we are having a bit of a shock  here...what's going on, just tell me...
RAY	Just do it.
RAY	Rachel, sweetheart...
RACHEL	Dad, you're really scaring me.
RAY	I need you to get your suitcase...
RACHEL	Dad. (break) Dad!
RAY	The one that you brought, bring it to  me, okay?
RAY	Can you do that for me, darling?
ROBBIE	What's happening?
RAY	Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We...  We've only got about another minute.
RAY	Please, Please, Please.
RAY	Just keep it down.
ROBBIE	Ray, I'm standing right beside you.  Can you please answer me?
RAY	Just get in the front seat Robbie.
RACHEL	Who's car is this?
RAY	Just get in.
RACHEL	Who's car is this?
MANNY	Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right.  I had to change the sole... Ray?
MANNY	Hey Ray? Ray? What?
MANNY	Ray. Open up.
MANNY	Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR
MANNY	What are you...
RAY	(interrupts him) Get in.
MANNY	That's funny, you gotta get out of the  car. You can't take it.
MANNY	It's not my car. It's not your car.  Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy  kids. Guy's gonna come back...
RAY	(interrupts him) I don't have time to  expl....
MANNY	(interrupts him) You're busting my chops.  I got a shop to run. You know how many  people...
RAY	(interrupts him) Get in!
MANNY	No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...
RAY
RACHEL	What do you mean?
MANNY	All right, get out of the truck! I'm  not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR
MANNY	I'm not fooling around, I got a busy  day ahead of me...
RAY	(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!
MANNY

RACHEL	Is this the terrorists?!?!
RAY

ROBBIE	Where are we going?!?!?!

ROBBIE
RAY	We gotta go.
ROBBIE
RAY
ROBBIE
RAY	Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep  it down Rachel!
RAY	Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!
ROBBIE	(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING
RAY
ROBBIE	Okay, (slapping his arms together on  top of each other, demonstrating) Put  em' up Rache.
ROBBIE	Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows  so she holds the position. He begins  to calm her down) This space right here,  this is yours.
ROBBIE	... This belongs to you, right?
RACHEL	(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...
ROBBIE	(reassuring her) You're safe in your  space.
RACHEL	(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my  space.
ROBBIE	(reassuring her) You're safe in your  space. Nothing is going to happen to  you in your space.
RACHEL	I'm really scared.
ROBBIE	I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk  to dad...
RACHEL	No....
ROBBIE	(reassuring her) I will be two feet  away. Okay.
ROBBIE	Will you hold my hand?
RACHEL	Yes.
ROBBIE	Are you gonna be okay?
RACHEL	(relatively calm) Yes.
ROBBIE	(taking a breath to calm himself) I  want to know everything you know.
RAY	This thing, this machine, it crawled  out of the ground and started torching  everything, just killing everybody.
ROBBIE	What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?
RAY	No, this came from some place else.
ROBBIE	You mean like Europe?
RAY
RAY	That machine, it was already buried.
RAY	Maybe it came down in the lightning  storm.
ROBBIE	Wait a minute... you just said it was  buried.
RAY	No, the machine I'm talking about was  buried. But, what came down in the lighting  storm, what operates it. That's the...  that's the.... You know. The....
RACHEL	The what?
ROBBIE	Why aren't there any helicopters or  airplanes?
RAY	Hey Rache. How you doing there girl?  (to Robbie) How she doing?
ROBBIE	How you doing?
RACHEL	I'm fine.
ROBBIE	(to Ray) She's good.
RAY	Good.  Hey, what was that thing you  did with her?
ROBBIE	Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic.
RAY	Hey Rachel
RACHEL	I want mom.
RAY	I know. You feel better?
RACHEL	I want mom.
RAY	Yeah, tell me about it, you know?
RACHEL	Take me to Mom's!
RAY	Listen, I just need you to hold it together  for me, okay?
RACHEL
RAY	When you start screaming like that,  you know, I can't really...
RACHEL
RAY	I know...
RACHEL
RAY	That's where we're going right now.
RACHEL
RAY
RACHEL	Come on, hurry up Dad...
RACHEL	Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks  on it)
RACHEL	(begins, and continues once in the house)
ROBBIE	(begins, and continues once in the house)
ROBBIE	They're gone.
RACHEL	Is she dead??
RAY	She's not dead. All right? She's just  no here. Okay? They're never here.
ROBBIE	How do you know?
RAY	Because they are on their way to Boston....
RAY	... and so they just kept on going,  they're probably up to your grandma's  house by now.
ROBBIE	(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.
RACHEL	How come the lights are on here and  not at your place?
RAY	Umm.... Because nothing bad happened  here. Okay?
RAY	So, were safe here. All Right?
RAY	Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay,  you are safe in your area...
RACHEL	Dad. That's not how it goes.
RAY	Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get  you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get  something to eat.  (digs into the box)  What do we have here??
ROBBIE	.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones....  You think all the circuits are down?
RAY	(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco,  Barbeque Sauce. This is really good  Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food.  What... What the hell is this?
ROBBIE	That's all that was in your kitchen.
RAY	Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right.
RAY	Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the  bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm....  We'll just get some sandwiches.
RAY	You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal?  Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie,  two for me, (he has one extra in his  hand) ...one for the house. (laughs)
RAY	Maybe after we get done eating, I will  take you down, teach you how to play  some poker. A little five card stud...  a little blackjack...
RACHEL	I'm allergic to peanut butter.
RAY	(laughs) Since when?
RACHEL	(with a snotty look) Birth!
RAY	Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two  pieces of bread) You can eat the bread.  Okay?
RACHEL	I'm not hungry.
RAY	Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to  be eating peanut butter sandwiches.  (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?
ROBBIE	I'm not hungry either.
RAY	You're not hungry either? Well, that's  fine.
RAY	Everybody just relax, okay? Because  we are here now and we're safe, and  we're gonna stay.  And in the morning  your mom and Tim are going to be here  and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?  (no responses) Okay.
RACHEL	If everything's fine, why do we have  to sleep in the basement. We've got  perfectly good beds.
RAY	It's like a slumber party.
ROBBIE	What are you afraid is gonna happen  to us?
RAY	(walks over to the weight room corner  of the basement) Nice basement.
RACHEL	I want to sleep in my bed. I've got  back problems.
RAY	Okay. You know on the Weather Channel  when there's a tornado, and they tell  you to go to the basement for safety?  It's like that.
RACHEL	There's gonna be tornadoes?
RAY	Rachel, no more talking.
RACHEL	Could you be a little nicer to me. God!
ROBBIE	Wanna stay here?
RACHEL	Yeah. Good night, love you.
ROBBIE	Love you, Rache.
RACHEL	Is the lighting back?
RAY	No, this is something else...
ROBBIE	(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
RAY
RACHEL
RAY
RAY
RACHEL	Are we still alive?
RAY	Down here!
RAY	Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?
MAX	Hey, how you doing? Wanna help me open  this?
RAY	Are you a passenger?
NEWS REPORTER	He's deaf. The shell went off right  beside him. The camera on his shoulder  saved his life. (to Max) You hear that  Max? Your stupid camera saved your stupid  life.
RAY	Where were you?
NEWS REPORTER	Out there in the pine barrens. We were  attached to a National Guard unit, the  83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of  those things around midnight. They've  got some kind of shield around them.  We can't see it, but everything we fire  at them detonates too early before we  can get close enough to cause any damage.  When they flash that thing, everything  lights up like Hiroshima.
RAY	There's more than one?
REPORTER	You gotta be kidding me right?
REPORTER	We were feeding New York but New York  went dark. So we patched over to D.C.,  they went down, L.A., Chicago, uplink  to London. Even called the affiliates  to try and get them to catch the feed,  but nobody answered.
REPORTER	It's the same everywhere. Once the tripods  start to move, no more news comes out  of that area.
RAY	Oh, my god!
REPORTER	You ain't seen nothing yet.
RAY	I saw that storm. I was right in the  middle of one of those.
REPORTER	No, you didn't see it like this. Those  machines come up from under the ground,  right? That means they must have been  buried there a long time ago. So who's  driving the god damn things? (pointing  to the monitor) Watch the lightning.  Watch it..... Watch the lighting.....
RAY	What is that?
REPORTER	That is them. They come down in capsules,  riding the lighting into the ground  into the machines right?
DRIVER	You hear that? We're getting the hell  out of here.
DRIVER	Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!
REPORTER	Hey. Were you on that plane?
REPORTER	Oh, that's too bad, it would have been  a really great story.
RAY	Look at me. Look at me.
RAY	You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?
RAY	Don't look down, don't look around me.  I'm taking you to the car and you're  gonna want to look around. But you are  not going to, are you?
RAY	You're doing good. You're doing good.  Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right  to Boston, and we're gonna see your  mom.
RACHEL	I'm not gonna look, dad.
RAY	That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay,  listen, I want you to close your eyes.  Got them closed?
RACHEL	Um-Huh.
RAY	There you go. Keep em' closed for me.
RAY	Robbie, get in.
RAY
RACHEL	Why are you yelling?
RAY	(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get  in!
ROBBIE	Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?
RAY	Because I don't want everybody to see  we've got a working car. (going over  the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson  until we find an open bridge or ferry,  then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then  take the back roads across Connecticut  all the way to Boston.
RACHEL	Where is everybody?
RAY	I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding  in their basements.
ROBBIE	If we had any balls, we'd go back there  and find one of those things and kill  it.
RAY	Yeah, well, why don't you just let me  make the big decisions, okay?
ROBBIE	Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's  about your speed.
RACHEL	Okay, enough Robbie!
RAY	(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray  shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want  Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird  to me but you decide.
RACHEL	Dad?!?!
RAY	Yes, Rachel.
RACHEL	I have to go to the bathroom.
RAY	Really?
ROBBIE	Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which  Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!
RAY	Not so fast, not so fast, all right?  Now, there are two things we have to  watch out for, and the second is people  who might want our car.
ROBBIE	There's nobody around!
RACHEL	I gotta go.
RAY	(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's  good right there. (points to a spot  20' away)
RACHEL
RAY	All right, then just go where I can  see you!
RACHEL
RAY	I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!
RACHEL
RAY	Listen. Every time you don't listen  to me, I'm telling your mother, okay?  I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm  making a list!
RAY	I told you to stay where I could see  you!
RACHEL	I'm sorry!

RACHEL	Where's everybody going?
RAY	I don't know Rach.
RACHEL	But we do right?
RAY	Yeah, we do.
RACHEL	Why'd he do that?
RACHEL	Why is he doing that?
RAY	He wants a ride. Everybody just wants  a ride.
RACHEL	Can we give him one?
RAY	Just sit back and put on your seatbelt.  Robbie, put on your seatbelt.
RAY	Put on your seatbelt Rachel.
ROBBIE	Be careful.

RIOT MAN 3	Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take  her, yeah, yeah....
RAY	Robbie!!
RACHEL	Looks like the power's still on here.
RAY	Yeah, power's still on because nothing  bad has come up from under the ground.
WOMAN	Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative,  thank you but we already have more blood  than we can use. Again... (repeats message)
HARBOR MASTER	Please move forward calmly, the boat  can make more than one trip. Please  move forward calmly, take your time,  don't rush. (repeats)

HARLAND	Over here! OVER HERE!!!
HARLAND	Hurry!!
HARLAND	(to Rachel) You all right?
HARLAND	(to Ray) And what about you?
RAY	(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)  (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable?  I need you to close your eyes now, okay?  You need some sleep.
RACHEL	Dad?
RAY	He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna  meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.
RACHEL	(about ready to cry) What do you think  mom's doing right this minute?
RAY	Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I  know she's not sleeping 'cause she is  so worried about you. (trying to comfort  her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen,  and she's making that awful tea that  she makes. And they're all just... ...  ...there all just counting the minutes  until they see you again.
RAY	(picking up the ribbon) What is this?  What... What is this?
RACHEL	I won.
RAY	You won?
RACHEL	The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.
RACHEL	Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?
RAY	(shakes his head in displeasure because  he can't think of it) I don't remember  that one.
RACHEL	Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?
RAY	I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one  either.
RAY	(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby.  So don't put me down. Because I've got  the fastest set of wheels in the town.  Something comes up to me that don't  even try....
RAY	(continues singing) ... If I had a set  of wings, man, I know she could fly.  She's my little deuce coupe. You don't  know what I've got... just my little  deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't  know what I've got....
HARLAND	Peach schnapps.
HARLAND	Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole  case of this shit.
RAY	Thank you.
HARLAND	I'm sorry about your son.
RAY	We got separated... he's gonna meet  us in umm... in Boston.
RAY	Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did  you loose anybody?
HARLAND	All of them.
HARLAND	(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy.
RAY	(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.
HARLAND	I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks.  You're welcome to stay, both of yous.
RAY	I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep.
HARLAND	(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause)  Those machines, those tripods they got...  They buried them... right under our  feet. Since before there were even people  here. They've been planning this for  a million years. We're beat to shit.
RAY	Please, my daughter.
HARLAND	Think about it.    ...    They defeated  the greatest power in the world in a  couple days. Walked right over us.   they'll keep coming. This is not a war  any more than there's a war between  men and maggots. This is an extermination.
HARLAND	(feeling he's not grasping the reality)  Are you afraid?
RAY	Of course I am.
HARLAND	(going on) I been around death plenty.  Drive an ambulance in the city. Well,  drove and ambulance in the city. That's  all over now, huh?    ....   You know  the people who make it Ray? The ones  that don't flatline before the hospital?  It's the ones who keep their eyes open,  keep looking at you, keep thinking.  Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll  kill you.    ......     I'm dead set  on livin'.
HARLAND	Hah. Dead set on Living.
RAY	Thank you for taking us in.
HARLAND	We're not going to be exterminated.
HARLAND	(with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come  on, I wanna show you something!
HARLAND	We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta  have a weakness. Come on, take a look.
HARLAND	Somehow they killed a few of these things  in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling  me the Japanese can figure it out but  we can't?
HARLAND	We can do it. We can get 'em. We can  figure it out.
RAY	Stay right there!
RAY	I have a daughter! Why did you bring  us here?
HARLAND	To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....   underground. When the time is right,  we'll take 'em by supries, the way they  took us. We'll take 'em by surprise.
HARLAND	We're right under their feet, Ray. Right  here, under their feet.
HARLAND	You miss your mommy? I had a little  girl nearly your age. You know, if anything  happens to your daddy, I'll take care  of you.
RAY	Rachel!
RAY	(distinctly angry, but not yelling)  You don't have anything to say to her,  do you understand? If you want to talk  to somebody, or ask somebody a question,  you ask me!
HARLAND	(also angry at Ray) What exactly is  your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna  do. How about you? You gonna sit here,  wait for them to come get you? Is that  your plan?
HARLAND	Maybe you want to get caught. Couple  of days hiding in a basement too much  for you, I bet. You'll probably turn  yourself right in!
RAY	Listen. It stopped.
HARLAND	(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be  okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll  train you as their pet. You know, train  you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...
RAY	(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!
RAY	(dead silent) Give me that!
HARLAND	You and I... I don't  think we are on  the same page.
HARLAND
RAY
HARLAND	(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My  Blood!!!
RAY	Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it!  You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!
HARLAND	(with an insane expression and tone)  They drink us!
RAY	Please, they'll hear you!
HARLAND	Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!
RAY	You gotta be quiet!
HARLAND	Drink US and....
RAY	They're gonna come back down here!
HARLAND	Then they spit us out all over their  goddamn red weeds!
RAY	(no longer whispering) Do you understand  what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let  my daughter die because of you.
HARLAND	This tunnel will get us to the city.  We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready  Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!
RAY	Stop it!
HARLAND	You can hide a whole army down there!
RAY	Stop it!!
HARLAND	... We'll go underground!
RAY
HARLAND	Sneak attacks at night!
RAY
HARLAND	We're the resistance Ray! They can't  occupy this country! Occupations always  fail! History's taught us that a thousand  times. This is our land.
HARLAND	(continues) ... We eat it, we breathe  it, only we can live on it! They can't  survive here Ray. They weren't built  for it.
RACHEL	What are you doing?
RAY	Whatever you hear... don't take this  off.
RACHEL	Dad??
RAY	Rach?
RACHEL	Dad?
RAY	What was that song... that lullaby I  didn't know?
RACHEL	Hushabye Mountains
RAY	Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it.
RACHEL	(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....
RAY	Don't stop.
RACHEL	... On Hushabye Mountain...
RAY	That's my girl.
RACHEL	... For far away my baby goes...
RACHEL	... it fills the sails ...
RACHEL	... of boats that are waiting ...
RACHEL	... Waiting to sail your worries away
RACHEL	... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye  Mountain ...
RACHEL	... Wave goodbye to the cares of the  day and watch your boat, from Hushabye  Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby  Bay.
RACHEL	(screams) AHHHH!!!
RAY	Rachel???
RAY	RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god,  no!
RAY	Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs)  Rachel??
RAY	(searching) Rachel, make some noise  baby. Rachel??
RAY	Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come  on!
RAY	Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!
RAY
RAY	(screams) AHH!
RACHEL	(screams) AHHHHH!!!!
RAY

RAY	(screams in pain) AHHH!

RAY	(reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response)  Rachel.
RAY	Rachel.

SOLDIER 2	We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!

RACHEL	What happened to it?

SOLDIER 3	I don't know, something's happening  to them. Please keep moving.
RAY	Something's happening to them?
SOLDIER 4	Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir.
RAY	Excuse me, excuse me, what happened  here? You guys take it down?
SOLDIER 5	No sir, it was behaving erratically,  walking in circles then it went down  on it's own about an hour ago. (to people)  not stop! Keep moving!
RACHEL	How is it dead all by it's self?
RAY	Rachel, I'm not sure.

RACHEL	Robbie?
ROBBIE	Hey dad!
NARRATOR	From the moment the invaders arrived,  breathed our air, ate and drank, they  were doomed. They were undone, destroyed,  after all of man's weapons and devices  had failed, by the tiniest creatures  that God and his wisdom, put upon this  earth. At the toll of a billion deaths,  man had earned his immunity, is right  to survive among this planet's infinite  organisms. And that right is ours against  all challenges, for men do not live  nor die in vein.
