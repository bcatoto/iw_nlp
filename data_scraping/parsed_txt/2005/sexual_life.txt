Sexual Life

LORNA	Hmm.  Simon and Garfunkel hit.  Eight letters.  Any thoughts?
LORNA	Excuse me, whatever happened to that sign, the one that used  to hang next to the pies?
WAITRESS	What sign?
LORNA	The one that said, "Today is the first day of the rest of your  life."
WAITRESS	That thing?  We got rid of it.
LORNA	Oh.
WAITRESS	Have you decided? Before Lorna can speak, we hear--
WOMAN	She'll have the steak and egg special. Lorna turns as TERRI, her roommate, joins her at the counter.
TERRI	Look at her, she needs protein.  Lots of protein.
LORNA	(to the Waitress) White toast.  Dry. The Waitress leaves.
LORNA	Working early today, huh?
TERRI	No, I had something important to do... Terri opens her bag and pulls out a small, gift-wrapped box.
TERRI	...Miss nineteen.
LORNA	I knew you'd remember. Terri gives Lorna a kiss on the lips.
TERRI	Of course I remembered.  Go on, open it.
LORNA	No, no.  I wasn't born until ten minutes before midnight.  And  that's when I'll open it.
TERRI	You better like it.  I don't want to tell what I had to do to  pay for it.
LORNA	Ooh.  It must be good.
TERRI	So what's the plan, Stan?  Something special today?  Other than  splurging on toast.
LORNA	Yes.  There is something.
TERRI	Good.  Count me in.
LORNA	No.  Something big.  Something I've been thinking about for a  long time.
LORNA	I can't do this forever, Terri.  Look... Lorna points to the corner of her eye.
LORNA	Crow's feet!  I'm nineteen!  Crow's feet!  I know I keep talking  about it, but this time I'm going to do it.  In fact, I did it.
TERRI	Okay...
LORNA	I called them.  I told them I was out.
TERRI	You did not.
LORNA	Uh-huh.  I have one more appointment.  Then, I'm...free.
TERRI	Give me your cell phone.  I'm calling them back right now. Lorna smiles and pours the shattered remnants of her phone on  the counter.
LORNA	A bus ran over it.  Isn't that perfect?  It's a perfect sign.
WAITRESS	(to Terri) Can't do that here, Miss.
TERRI	I know, I know.  I'm not going to light the damn thing. (beat) Fuck me.
LORNA	Look, I'm good for next month's rent. This takes Terri by surprise.
TERRI	What, you're leaving too?
LORNA	Maybe.  Get out of town for a while.  I really feel good about  this.
TERRI	I wish you'd talked to me first.
LORNA	I didn't because...I knew you'd try to talk me out of it.
TERRI	That's because I'm looking out for you.  It's because there is  so much opportunity here.
LORNA	I know. (beat) Listen, I'm late. Lorna leaves some change on the counter, picks up her gift and  gives Terri a hug.
LORNA	Thanks.
TERRI	Well...Happy Birthday. As Lorna goes, the Waitress reappears.
WAITRESS	Your friend comin' back?
TERRI	Hard to say.
TODD	Seventy-five, right?  For the half-hour.
LORNA	Not including tip. She smiles.  Todd paces uneasily.
TODD	And, typically, the size of the tip is...
LORNA	Depends on how generous you feel.
TODD	Of course.
LORNA	Is...this your first appointment?
TODD	No.  I've done this before. Lorna thinks otherwise.  She pats the seat next to her.
LORNA	Come over here, you're making me nervous. He plops down next to her.
LORNA	So, how much extra do you feel like spending?
TODD	I don't know.  Another fifty dollars?
LORNA	Uh-huh. She thumbs through the wedding photos.
LORNA	So, this is what you do.  Weddings.
TODD	It pays the rent.
LORNA	These are good.  You're really a good photographer.
TODD	Well, somebody thinks so.  I get a lot of work.
LORNA	And you can only spend another fifty on me? Todd walked right into that one. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) Maybe you'll feel more generous once you get to know me. Lorna smiles.  Her face has an open, unguarded beauty.
TODD	You have a great smile, do you know that?
LORNA	Yeah, I've heard.
TODD	And I like your name.  Lorna.  Like the cookie.
LORNA	Gee, I've never hear that one before. She laughs at him.  But it's not unkind. LORNA (CONT'D) (cont'd) I have a friend who makes photos.  She's had some stuff in magazines.
TODD	Hey, I'm not afraid of sick images.  In fact, it's what I aspire  to do, create pictures that are edgy, that really assault you,  that reach out and slap you in the face.
LORNA	Why?
TODD	Well...I don't know.  Shake people out of their...complacency.
LORNA	She photographs people pissing on each other.
TODD	Uh-huh.
LORNA	Yeah...disgusting.
TODD	Maybe that's the point.
LORNA	But who would want to look at that?  I mean, bathrooms have doors  for a reason.
TODD	What do you like?
LORNA	I like things that make me happy.  Like this. Lorna holds up a photo of a beautiful, smiling bride.
LORNA	I bet she's going to have a very happy life. She lingers over the photo.
LORNA	I don't think I'm the marrying kind, though.
TODD	Me, neither.  Marriage, it's so...medieval.  Sometimes when I'm  doing a wedding I look at the bride and groom and think, "What  a couple of lemmings."
LORNA	I'm not sure people can be true, that's all.
TODD	Right.  That, too. Lorna puts down the photos.
LORNA	Well...Now that we've gotten to know each better, maybe we should  get started.
LORNA	Oh, you really have a big cock...My, you really have a big cock...God,  what a big cock you have.
LORNA	As she goes about her work, Lorna wears a vaguely puzzled expressions.
LORNA	Forty-two across...Simon & Garfunkel hit...eight letters...begins  with 'I'...I...I'm A Loser...Did they sing that?...Susie used  to play Mom's Simon & Garfunkel records all the time...I scratched  one once and she pulled my hair...I haven't spoken to her for  almost a year...Her little kid must be walking by now...Maybe  I should give Susie a call...Nah, fuck that!  She's perfectly  capable of calling me...I mean, I'm listed...I'm...I am a rock...that's  it!...I Am A Rock, that's the answer...I am a--
LORNA	(flatly) God, you really have a big cock. Like Pavlov's proverbial dog, Todd MOANS and the whole thing  is quickly over.
LORNA	Wow.  That was something.
TODD	Yeah...was it?
LORNA	Let me tell you...that was something.
TODD	Really.
LORNA	Cut the modesty.  You really know what you're doing.
LORNA	(into phone) Hey, it's Lorna...I'm clocking out for the last time...No, I'm  not done for the day, I'm done...Wait, I don't think you heard  me...Well, just give it to one of the other girls.  Give it to  Terri...I don't care if he's an important client, I told you  I'm...Well, you'll just have to cancel it, won't you?...I don't  care what it pays, it's not my fuckin'--
LORNA	(into phone) Hold on... (to Todd) What?
TODD	Nothing.  Are you alright?
LORNA	I'm fine.  The cab fare will be another twenty.
TODD	You never said anything about cab fare.
LORNA	Of course I did.  Are you calling me a liar?
TODD	No.  I swear, you didn't say a word about it. Lorna slowly brings the phone to her ear.
LORNA	(into phone) Alright.  Where is it?
TODD	You haven't told me where we're going yet.
LORNA	Make a right at the light. He does.
TODD	Can I ask you a question? (without a beat) No, forget it...it's stupid.
LORNA	Go on, ask.
TODD	Well, after we...after we did it, you didn't really mean what  you said, did you?  About me being so good.
TODD	(back-peddling) I'm only asking because I'm fascinated by this whole scene you're  in.  So, don't worry about sparing my feelings or anything.   I'm just curious.
LORNA	Pull over.
TODD	What?
LORNA	Pull over here. He does.  Up the block is a high-rise, luxury hotel.  Limos and  cabs line the driveway.  Uniformed doormen guard the entrance.
LORNA	You see that hotel?  In one of those rooms, there's a man waiting...he's  waiting for me.  I don't know what his name is or what he looks  like.  He may have bad skin.  He may be really ugly.  But no  matter how he looks, or how bad he smells, or whether he makes  weird wheezing sounds when he comes, I tell him the same thing...the  same thing I told you.
TODD	Right...Well, that's what I thought.  I mean, a guy would have  to be pretty lame to think that...
LORNA	To think what?
TODD	Nothing. Quite out of the blue, she leans over and kisses him on the cheek.
LORNA	It's Todd, right.
TODD	Yeah.
LORNA	Well, Todd, you're alright. (beat) And that I don't say that to everyone. She opens the door, starts out--
TODD	If I wanted to see you again--
LORNA	No. You can't.  You can't see me again. (beat) But thanks for asking.
TODD	Lorna!  Lorna! But Lorna is gone.
PHIL	(to the couple) Beautiful, just beautiful. (to Todd) You used a rubber, I hope.
TODD	Of course.
PHIL	And how much did this afternoon delight set you back?
TODD	Oh.  About a buck and a quarter. (to the couple) We just need to reload. As they do--
PHIL	Since when do you have a hundred and twenty-five dollars to throw  away?
TODD	I'm sure you spend just as much on porn rentals.
PHIL	There's no comparison.  Here, I'll do the math for you. Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag. PHIL (CONT'D) (cont'd) (punching in numbers) A video rents for $2.65.  That's a two-day rental.  That means  you can get off at least a couple times before it's due.  $125  divided by $2.65 equals approximately 47.  47 X 2 = 94.  I can  get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid to get  off once.  Now tell me who gets the better deal.
TODD	You're right.  I can't argue with that.
PHIL	Anyway, I stopped watching porno.
TODD	You did?  Why?
PHIL	They kinda depress me. (beat) When I want to get off now, you know what I use?
TODD	What? Phil taps his forehead.
PHIL	My imagination. (to the couple) Okay, folks.  It's magic time.
LATER.	The couple is gone.  Phil and Todd wrap some equipment. Phil (cont'd) What I don't understand is, aren't you getting enough action  from that Sarah?
TODD	What's Sarah got to do with it?
PHIL	You're seeing her, aren't you?
TODD	Sarah...that's a whole different situation.
PHIL	But you're doing it with her, right?
TODD	I like Sarah a lot.  And I don't want to blow it by pushing too  hard.
PHIL	You mean, you haven't...
TODD	Technically?  No.
PHIL	She won't put out?
TODD	No, no, no.  You don't get it.  You can't equate the two.  What  I did with Lorna--
PHIL	Lorna?
TODD	That's her name.  Lorna.  I mean, that's the name she gave me.  person is like?  What that world is like?  I was just...doing  research.  The lower depths...
PHIL	I didn't say anything.
SARAH	Shit!  Sold out! Sarah, at twenty-five, is cute, brainy, articulate, and hopelessly  insecure.
SARAH	I am so sorry.
TODD	That's alright.  I hear it's really overrated.  And long.
SARAH	I could just kill him!  This is not the first time he's done  this, either.
TODD	Done what?
SARAH	Cooked up some phony emergency, right as I'm getting on the elevator.
TODD	He's your boss.  Being an asshole is part of the job description.
SARAH	We're talking about the most self-centered man I have ever met.
TODD	Do what?
SARAH	Ruin my evening.  Our evening. (without a beat) You know, he also thinks he's God's gift to women.  I'm surprised  he hasn't been sued by now...Okay, okay.  Stop me.
TODD	Sarah.  Take a breath.
SARAH	Okay.  I'm taking a breath. And she does.
TODD	Now, take another one.
SARAH	I like you.  Have I told you that?
TODD	Not today.
SARAH	You know what I want to do?  I want to go shopping.
TODD	Shopping?  For what?
SARAH	For a house.
TODD	(completely thrown) Just what I was thinking.
SARAH	Look at the detail on that one.  Wow.  Every one of these is  a gem.  Makes the stuff I work on look pretty shabby by comparison.
SARAH	What's this? She lifts up Lorna's birthday gift -- still unwrapped.Todd reacts  -- he forgot to get rid of it -- and Sarah reacts to Todd.
SARAH	Obviously, not for me.
TODD	Something...somebody left in front the studio.  I just picked  it up.
TODD	What are you doing?
SARAH	Maybe we can find out whose it is. Inside is a silver bracelet, and a hand-written note.
SARAH	(reading) "Lorna.  Remember, I'm in your corner.  Love, Terri."  Pretty  cool bracelet.  You just found this.
TODD	Stupid of me...I should've left it.
SARAH	Lorna.  That's a name you don't hear very much.  Lorna.  Like  the cookie.
TODD	No.
SARAH	Terri and Lorna.  Sisters, maybe?  Lovers, more like it.  Or...witches.
TODD	You have a perverse mind. (beat) ...which I like, by the way.
SARAH	Or...perhaps Terri killed Lorna, and this "gift" provides her  with an alibi.
TODD	Maybe you should put it back.
SARAH	What, aren't you a little curious? Todd pulls over and stops.
TODD	Sarah...I don't know how to put this.  This is our fourth night  out, and I feel a lot of pressure...for this to work.
SARAH	I want it to work, too. (off his look) Oh.  Is this about sex?
TODD	Don't you think we're being a little...methodical about the whole  thing?  Maybe we should just...
SARAH	What?  Get it over with?
TODD	Not exactly.
SARAH	Don't you think it's better to be sure of each other first?   To have a little bit of trust?
TODD	You can trust me.
SARAH	I know, I know. (beat) But you're not sleeping with anyone else, right?
TODD	Of course not.
SARAH	It's not such a strange thing to ask.  Sometimes relationships...overlap.
TODD	I told you.  I'm not. Beat.
SARAH	You haven't asked me if I'm seeing anyone.
TODD	Is that bad?
SARAH	It's silly, I know, but it makes me feel like you couldn't imagine  anyone being interested in me.
TODD	What?  You should be flattered I don't ask.  I respect you enough  to assume you'd tell me if you're involved with someone.
SARAH	Hmm.  Ask me, anyway.
TODD	Are you serious? (off her look) Alright.  Are you seeing anyone?
SARAH	Absolutely not. Todd takes the bracelet, puts it on the dash, then leans to kiss  Sarah.
SARAH	I do want to make love tonight.
TODD	I'm just worried that all this talk is going to kill the spontaneity--
SARAH	I think spontaneity is overrated.
SARAH	Todd, the light. He switches it off.  They sit side by side and undress down to  their underwear.   They look at each other.
SARAH	Wait.  Don't say anything.
TODD	Okay. Beat.
SARAH	What were you going to say?
TODD	I wasn't going to say anything.
SARAH	Oh.
TODD	You look beautiful--
SARAH	No, don't say that.  Let's get under the covers. They climb into bed and move into each other's arms.
SARAH	Let's go slowly. They kiss, caress, shedding their inhibitions. Then--
SARAH	Oh.  Oww!
TODD	What happened?
SARAH	Dammit...my foot.  I've got one of those...what's the word?
TODD	A bunion
SARAH	Not a bunion.  A spasm.
TODD	Oh, a foot spasm.  Here let me-- He throws back the covers and massages her foot.
SARAH	Oww!  No, stop!  It hurts!  I hate this!
TODD	What can we do?
SARAH	Nothing, it's fine, it's fine.  Lemme just walk it off. She gets out of bed and hobbles into--
TODD	She has a better-looking body than I imagined...Breasts are definitely  bigger than I thought.  You can just never tell with breasts,  can you?...I don't know what to make of this foot problem...Maybe  she gets a spasm every time she has sex...I've heard of people  with problems like that...People who can't have sex without laughing,  or burping...Oh, God, what if she's one of them...
SARAH	I am so embarrassed.  Trust me, this doesn't happen all the time.
TODD	The thought never crossed my mind.
TODD	She won't look at me.  Why won't she look at me?..I'll bet she's  preoccupied with her foot.  She's praying she won't get another  spasm, another foot freak-out...She's being awfully quiet, too...Why  is she so quiet?...Maybe she needs to concentrate...Some women  need to concentrate...I read that in a magazine at the grocery  store...That blonde check-out girl who works there is really  cute...I love the way she says, "Paper or plastic?"...
SARAH	Todd!  Shhh... Todd stops.  Everything stops.
TODD	What's the matter?
SARAH	These walls, they're paper-thin.  This building is so poorly  built.  Everyone can hear you.
TODD	Is that why you're so quiet?
SARAH	Yes, the walls are...What are you saying?
TODD	It's hard for me to tell if you're enjoying this.
SARAH	Of course, I am.  I'm sorry if I'm not vocal enough for you.
TODD	That's not what I...Sarah, I just want to make sure I'm doing  something right here.
SARAH	There's no right or wrong way to do this.
TODD	I know.  I just want to make sure I'm...you know, in the ballpark.
SARAH	Todd, I don't expect you to do everything right the first time...Sorry,  that didn't come out the way I meant it...
TODD	You didn't like it.
SARAH	No, I didn't say that.  I was just...Let's be still for a while.
SARAH	Everyone expects fireworks the first time you do it.  But that's  just a myth.
TODD	A myth.  You're right.
SARAH	Let's not be too hard on ourselves.
TODD	I agree.
SARAH	Our expectations were a little high, that's all. Todd nods his agreement.
TODD	And at the end of the day, sex is only one part of the picture.
SARAH	True.  What do you mean?
TODD	I know this couple. They had nothing in common but good sex.  it lasted?  A month.  They were hot for each other...but there  was nothing else.
SARAH	Right. (beat) There's got to be something else. And they stare at the ceiling.
SARAH	Morning, Pappy.  How's she doing today?
GRANDFATHER	Don't pay her any mind, Sarah.  The things she says, they get  stranger by the day.
GRANDMOTHER	They keep telling me I'm doing fine, that I'm even improving.  protect me from?
SARAH	Maybe they know something you don't.
GRANDMOTHER	Like hell. She pulls out a pack of American Spirit cigarettes and lights  one.  Sarah reacts.
SARAH	Nan.
GRANDMOTHER	What?  One in the morning with coffee.  One at night with cocktails.
SARAH	Oh, please.
GRANDMOTHER	Your story, that's the one I want to hear.
SARAH	I wish I had a story to tell.
GRANDMOTHER	Hmm.  The last time there was talk of an admirer.
SARAH	All you want is dirt, Nan.  Admit it.
GRANDMOTHER	The world is made of dirt, Sarah.  So, please, dish.  No detail  is too small.
SARAH	I...I'm sleeping with two different men.
GRANDMOTHER	Hmm.  Continue.
SARAH	One of them is a good man.  He's good for me.
GRANDMOTHER	Like vitamins.
SARAH	Sort of.  The other one, he can be a complete ass.  A total jerk.
GRANDMOTHER	In other words...he excites you.
SARAH	He does.  And I hate it.  I hate him.  And, on top of that, I  can't have him.
GRANDMOTHER	Can you see your Pappy? Sarah looks back over her shoulder.  She catches a glimpse of  her Grandfather.  He's still on the front porch.
SARAH	He hasn't moved.
GRANDMOTHER	Good.  Keep an eye on him.
SARAH	Why?
GRANDMOTHER	Because I'm going to tell you something he shouldn't hear.  Something  no one knows.  Once, I had two lovers.  One was your grandfather.  and people would look at us and say, "Now, there goes a couple."  And I liked that.
SARAH	Don't worry.  He's not moving.
GRANDMOTHER	The other man -- he was a boy, really -- he had no prospects.  certainly had no respect for my virginity.  And I liked that,  too.
GRANDMOTHER	But I had to make a choice.  I chose your grandfather.  The day  before the wedding, I went to let the other boy down.  Met him  by a river where we used to swim.  Well, one thing led to another,  and when I returned home that night, I'd left my virginity back  in the tall grass by that river.
GRANDMOTHER	But I did bring something back.  A bite mark.  That sonuvabitch  left on my neck, the size of a peach pit.
SARAH	Did Pappy see it?
GRANDMOTHER	He did and he didn't.  On the wedding night -- in this house  -- I managed to squeak by.  It was dark.  We were shy.  He took  me in his arms and said, "I'm glad you waited for me."  In other  words, I lost my virginity twice in the same week.
SARAH	No small feat.
GRANDMOTHER	It's an accomplishment.  But the next morning, your Pappy saw  it.  He demanded an explanation.  And, Sarah, do you know how  I got out of that pickle?
SARAH	You lied.
GRANDMOTHER	Damn right.  I said, "What, you don't remember giving me this?"  He said, "No."  And I said, "Well, you were so fired up last  night, it's a wonder you can remember anything."
SARAH	And you've never been tempted to...
GRANDMOTHER	What?  Come clean with your Pappy?  Why should I tell him?  He  had nothing to do with it.
SARAH	Right.
GRANDMOTHER	It's mine.  Not his.
SARAH	I wonder what became of that boy.
GRANDMOTHER	Never saw him again.  I don't regret a thing, if that's what  you're wondering.
SARAH	I was, in fact.
GRANDMOTHER	Look what I have.  I have you. (beat) And you know what else?  I have the tall grass by that river.  really beautiful that day.
SARAH	I don't believe it.  You're actually asking my opinion.  You  really want to know what I think?
JOSH	To tell you the truth, no.  I just wanted to hear your voice.
SARAH	(shrugs) Boo.
JOSH	Alright, what do you think of it?
SARAH	You'd have to pay me to live in that neighborhood. (off his look) Hey, what do I know?  I'm just the assistant.
JOSH	What are they going to think?  That's all that matters.
SARAH	To paraphrase you, this is going to give them a major hard-on.
JOSH	You haven't met these women. Sarah laughs, catches herself and stops.
JOSH	The champagne order?
SARAH	Done.  Dom Perignon.  Fifteen cases.
JOSH	Invitations?
SARAH	A messenger is meeting us at the site with the proofs.
JOSH	Good. He reaches behind her and pats her butt.
SARAH	Stop it.
JOSH	I can't.
SARAH	Have you never heard of the phrase "impulse control"? They reach the elevators.
JOSH	I love it when you're full of contempt. She just glares.
SARAH	People are starting to notice, Josh.  I work very hard to act  completely indifferent toward you.  The least you could do is  to keep your hands to yourself.
JOSH	I've got a better idea.
SARAH	What?
JOSH	Why don't I distribute a memo, informing everyone that you and  I are not sleeping together?
SARAH	Josh, just for the sake of variety, could you take me seriously  for a moment?
JOSH	Alright, alright.  I have another idea.
SARAH	Please, don't...
JOSH	Let's just end it. Beat.
SARAH	Yes.  I think we should. Josh didn't expect this.  The elevator arrives.  He steps aboard  and holds the door for her.
JOSH	Coming?
SARAH	I'm going to take the stairs. Josh shrugs and lets the doors close. A beat.  Sarah considers the stairs, then hits the down button  again.
SARAH	I can't put my finger on it...I just don't feel it's happening  with us.
TODD	You don't want it work out, that's what you're saying.
SARAH	I do.  I mean, I did.  It's no one's fault.  It's chemistry.
TODD	You want your pickle?
SARAH	Do you want your pickle?!
TODD	You know what the problem is?  The first night we went out, we  should've just fucked.  Right away.  Without thinking.  Two dumb  bunnies.  Without any history,  any baggage.  A pair of blank  slates.  Fucking.  It could've been perfectly meaningless.  You  want chemistry?  The less you think, the better the chemistry.
SARAH	I'm sorry.  It's just not happening for me.
TODD	The least you can do is give me your goddam pickle. They look away from each other.  Todd eats in silence.  The pickle  sits between them.
SARAH	(into phone) I don't care if it costs the same, if it's not Dom Perignon tell  them we don't want it, alright?...Good.  Anybody else call?   Nobody, huh...Okay.
SARAH	Guess I'll be heading back...
JOSH	Wait. (beat) About the other day...Are you having any second thoughts?
SARAH	(shrugs) No.  None.
JOSH	You're angry I called it quits, aren't you?  You can admit it.
SARAH	No.  In fact, I want to thank you.
JOSH	For what?
SARAH	For sparing me from the most unhealthy relationship I've ever  had in my life.  For that, I thank you.
JOSH	Touch�.
SARAH	Are you having seconds thoughts?
JOSH	No.  I say, let's make a clean break.  Let's just walk away from  it.
JOSH	What are you doing?
SARAH	Let's seal the deal.  Shake. It's a little awkward, but they do.
JOSH	Alright.  Now that we've put that behind us, there's one problem  left.
SARAH	What?
JOSH	Where do we put the bed? Josh gestures to the empty room.  Sarah smiles -- it's a familiar  game.
SARAH	Oh, the bed.  Let's put it against this wall.  Away from the  morning sun.
JOSH	Wrong.  It's got to go here.  So you can see the hallway. They head out. As Josh and Sarah leave the house, they "decorate" several rooms.
SARAH	Not enough height for bunk beds.
JOSH	Why do you assume there will be two children?
SARAH	There has to be.  They need to keep each other company.
SARAH	Definitely not enough space for two people to cook.
JOSH	I prefer to eat out.
SARAH	Oh, no.  I wouldn't put the ottoman there.
JOSH	Where would you put it?
SARAH	It needs to go over... She waves her hand, accidentally brushing against Josh's chest.
SARAH	Hmmm.
JOSH	What? ...and linger.  They both know what's happening.
SARAH	We have another problem.
JOSH	And that would be...?
SARAH	What do we do with the elephant in the room?
JOSH	You're very clever. She rubs his chest.
SARAH	We shouldn't be rude to an elephant. She lets her hand drop to his crotch.
SARAH	They can get very annoyed...if you ignore them. She pulls Josh to her and kisses him.  Josh fairly attacks her,  his hands all over her body.
SARAH	Josh.  The door. It's an absurd request -- the room is completely exposed, but  Josh carries her to the front door and kicks it closed.
ON JOSH AND SARAH	With Sarah's back against the door, Josh enters her.
CLOSE ON SARAH	She looks up.  With no roof above them, she has a brilliant view  of...the clouds.  They float past as she thinks--
JOSH	I have to tell you, that was the best "break-up" sex I've ever  had.
SARAH	It was, wasn't it? (beat) Closure is important. jOSH Now you can move on.  You can meet someone who... sarah What?  Someone who's not a prick like you. Josh reacts -- slightly offended. joSH No.  Someone who's...free. sarah Oh.  Right. (beat) As if that would have made any difference in this...what is this  thing called again?  A relationship?
TODD	(into phone) No, no, no.  You don't understand.  I don't want an appointment,  I just need to get in touch with her...She left a package here  by mistake, a gift...No, I'd rather give it to her myself...Lorna,  but I assume none of you use your real names...What?  But she  was working last week?...And you don't have a forwarding number?  so--
TODD	Dammit. He dials again.  Then, a knock at the door.  Todd reacts -- he's  not expecting anyone.
SARAH	Still dressed in the clothes she wore earlier.  She holds a small  paper bag.
TODD	Sarah...
SARAH	I brought you something. She hands him the bag.  He looks inside.
TODD	Pickles.  Huh. (beat) What's in your hair? She touches her hair.
SARAH	Oh.  Sawdust.  Lots of sawdust at the job site. (beat) Can I come in? Todd puts the bag of pickles on the kitchen counter.  He sees  Lorna's bracelet...and slides it into a trash can.
GIRL	Need some help?
JOSH	Yes, I have a problem.  I need some...something to cover up a...Hell,  just take a look.
GIRL	Yeah.  You're fucked.
JOSH	I can do without the attitude, thank-you.
GIRL	Try concealer.  Aisle three.
JOSH	(impatient) But what do I do with it?
GIRL	Just put it on.  And call your lawyer. She smiles.
GWEN	Unbelievable.
JOSH	What?
GWEN	I'm reading a stupid article in a stupid magazine.
JOSH	If it's stupid, why read it?
GWEN	(ignores this) The whole issue is devoted to famous couples who are breaking  up.  Listen to this...Remember the blonde doctor on that show  you hate?
JOSH	Yeah.  She's a bore.
GWEN	She's breaking up with her husband of twenty years.  Said a friend,  "Her show's in syndication, she's thin, she's rich and she wants  to play." Josh dries his hands.
JOSH	Some poor tree gave its life so we could know that.
GWEN	It's comforting, reading about these broken marriages. Josh opens the door into the--
JOSH	Why?
GWEN	It's not enough for our marriage to succeed.  Everyone else's  must fail.
JOSH	Is this going to be one of those nights?
GWEN	What?
JOSH	One of those nights we talk.
GWEN	No.  There's no need to talk, because there's no problem. He gets into bed next to her.
JOSH	I've been under a lot of stress.
GWEN	You don't have to apologize.  There's nothing wrong with the  slump we're going through.  In fact, it's a good thing.
JOSH	How's that? He turns off the side light.  We can't see them -- the room is  completely dark.
GWEN	Too much passion can ruin a marriage.  Look at Eric and Sylvia.  at the genitals.  And, then...total burn-out.  A marriage cannot  sustain that kind of intensity.  It's good for people to grow  bored with each other.  That way, they can meet and fall in love  again.
GWEN	In case you hadn't noticed...I'm trying to seduce you.
JOSH	I can feel that.
GWEN	You're welcome to reciprocate. Josh turns on the light and sits up.
JOSH	I can't.
GWEN	It's alright.
JOSH	To seduce...to be seduced, there needs to be an element of surprise.  surprise?
GWEN	Rub my feet. He does.
GWEN	I think we should have an affair.
JOSH	What?
GWEN	With each other.
JOSH	That makes no sense.
GWEN	You pick me up at a bar...
JOSH	And, what?  Pretend I don't know you?
GWEN	(ignores him) Or we could meet at a hotel.  I'll register under my maiden name.
JOSH	THE GRADUATE is about a married woman having an affair with a  college boy.
GWEN	When I met you, you were a college boy.
JOSH	Gwen, THE GRADUATE is a story about a very unhappy woman who  has an affair out of wedlock.  As I recall, it turns out rather  badly for her.
GWEN	Alright.  Bad example. (rethe foot rub) You can stop.
JOSH	Actors pretend.  That's what they do.  I'm not an actor.  And  I love you the way you are.
GWEN	I love you, too. And he turns out the light again.
JOSH	Pretending to be strangers is not going to solve the problem.
GWEN	Who said there was a problem?
JOSH'S POV	Through the crowd he spots Sarah, entering with her date -- Todd.
GWEN	Your lovely assistant is here. (reTodd) You didn't tell me she had a new boyfriend.
JOSH	I don't ask her about her personal life. Sarah and Todd arrive.
SARAH	Hey, you two.  Todd, this is my boss Josh, and his wife Gwen.
TODD	Sarah's told me a lot about you. Josh is not sure how to take that.
GWEN	Sarah, you look great.  You've been keeping my boy on his best  behavior?
SARAH	It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.
GWEN	I know he asks to go above and beyond the call of duty.
SARAH	He can be tough.
JOSH	But fair.
GWEN	Josh, I'm trying to thank Sarah for all the extra attention she  gives you.
SARAH	You're welcome.
GWEN	We should really have you over for dinner, Sarah.  It's been  too long.  You can bring...
TODD	Todd.
GWEN	Sorry.  I'm hopeless when it comes to names.
JOSH	Especially after two glasses of champagne.
GWEN	Hey, I'm still working on the first, thank you. (to Todd) So, are you two living together?
TODD	Living together?  No. Sarah and Todd both laugh.
SARAH	We've only known each other a few weeks. Josh reacts -- he knew nothing of this.
GWEN	You two seem to fit.  It only took me a few days to know with  Josh.  In fact, I knew after the first date.
SARAH	You knew what?
GWEN	That he was the one for me.
JOSH	(to Sarah) She loves to embarrass me.
SARAH	(to Gwen) Don't stop.  I want to hear about this first date.
GWEN	Well, it was the cheapest date I've ever been on.
JOSH	I was broke.
GWEN	Do you know the Chinese place on Third?  That little hole-in-the-wall?
TODD	I know it.  Used to be a cool dive.  Now it's ultra-hip and overpriced.
GWEN	Really?  I think our first dinner cost a grand total of ten dollars.
JOSH	Gwen loves to dissect our first date.
GWEN	It was a momentous night.  Babe, we should really go back there.
JOSH	Gwen, why don't you continue your stroll down memory lane while  I drink?  Todd, you up for it?
TODD	Sure. They move away toward--
JOSH	(to bartender) Gin.  Straight up.  Olives. (Todd) What are you having?
TODD	I'm fine, thanks.
JOSH	So...Sarah's an attractive girl.
TODD	Very.
JOSH	You two serious?
TODD	(shrugs) Hard to say.
JOSH	She wants to play the field, right?
TODD	No, that's not it.
JOSH	I see.  You want to fuck around. Todd reacts.
JOSH	C'mon, we're guys.  I know the drill. Todd considers his audience, then decides to open up--
TODD	We dated a few times, and to be honest, I was on the fence about  Sarah.  I liked her, but I didn't think we were in a good groove.
JOSH	I didn't know. (beat) She didn't say a thing about it.
TODD	It wasn't unexpected, but Sarah took it really hard.  So where  did that leave me?  I was ambivalent about things, right?  But  then my ambivalence had to take a back seat.  I had to be there  for her.  Completely.  And, ready or not, our relationship became...a  real relationship.
TODD	You know, I wasn't ready to be that involved with anybody.  I  don't know...Death has a funny way of making you get outside  yourself.
JOSH'S POV	Gwen is still chatting with Sarah.  Gwen makes eye contact with  Josh and sends him a warm smile.
GWEN	You missed the on-ramp.
JOSH	I know.
GWEN	Why?
JOSH	Somewhere we need to go first.
GWEN	We don't have to do this tonight.
JOSH	Yes, we do. She peers in the window.
GWEN	We can't go in here.  Everything's different. He opens the door for her.
JOSH	That's okay.  We're different, too.
GWEN	Sarah's a very interesting girl.  Did you know she's training  for the marathon?
JOSH	I don't want to talk about Sarah.
GWEN	What do you want to talk about, then?
JOSH	I want to talk about me... A beat.
JOSH	...and what a fool I've been. Gwen is not prepared for this.
JOSH	I thought if we came here tonight we could...start again.
GWEN	(flustered) But I thought you were over this place.  And, look...There's  nothing left.  Not one remnant of our first date...anywhere.
JOSH	(brightens) The fortune cookies haven't changed. He brings over the plate.
GWEN	You're supposed to wait--
JOSH	I can't wait.  I have to know. He opens the first.
JOSH	(reading) "You are on the verge of success"...in bed. Gwen laughs, opens one herself.
GWEN	(reading) "You will have a change of plans"...in bed. Josh reacts, opens a third.
JOSH	(reading) "You are very creative"...in bed.
GWEN	Hmm.  That's what I've heard.
JOSH	The last cookie.  Go ahead.
GWEN	No.  You open it. He slowly cracks in open.
JOSH	It's blank. (checks both sides) I got a blank.
GWEN	Blank...in bed.  That's disappointing.
JOSH	No, it's perfect.  Blank...no problems, no history, nothing...in  bed.
JOSH	By the way, I didn't get your name.
GWEN	What? (off his smile) Oh, my name. She glances across the street.  A shop window sign reads, "Bail  Bonds."
GWEN	My name is Gail.  Gail Bonds.
JOSH	Well, Gail, I'm not usually this forward on a first date, may  I take you to my car and ravish you?
GWEN	Hmm.  On one condition.
JOSH	What's that?
GWEN	That you tell me your name.
JOSH	Oh, I thought everyone knew my name.  I'm Bill Gates.  Billionaire.
GWEN	Is it true what they say, Bill, about billionaires?  That all  the wealth is just a way to compensate...for size?
JOSH	People are jealous.
GWEN	I can imagine.  It must be so lonely at the top. He reaches between her knees.
GWEN	What are you doing?
JOSH	What do you think I'm doing? (beat) The fortune cookie said you're on the verge of success...in bed.
GWEN	We're not in a bed.
JOSH	You shouldn't read fortune cookies too literally. Josh swings Gwen onto his lap.  They go at each other like...a  couple of college kids.
CLOSE ON JOSH	As he makes love to his wife, he thinks--
JOSH	...Can anyone see us?...Is anyone looking?...Why should it bother  you?  You're alone...with your wife...That's the way it's supposed  to be...You know every inch of her...every smell...every sigh...every  freckle...the shape of her ass...the mole under her nipple...the  whole history of her body...And, you know that if you really  concentrate, you can succeed...in imagining...she's someone you  don't know...
GWEN	Color.  That's the problem with this room, it needs color.  Think  of...the vibrant colors of Haiti.
JOANNE	Personally, Haiti does nothing for me.  When your father and  I were there -- this was before you were born, I almost died  from a piece of lettuce, and I wouldn't want anything to remind  me of that trip.
GWEN	Alright.  I didn't say anything.
JOANNE	Because you're not sure?
GWEN	No, I'm sure.  I'm sure he's sleeping with her. (beat) And I may have to kill him.
JOANNE	Hmm.
GWEN	What?  You think I should just forget about it?
JOANNE	Yes, I do.
GWEN	Mother, don't you think honesty is essential in a marriage?
JOANNE	It depends.  It can be quite detrimental. Gwen begins to pace in exasperation.
JOANNE	Alright.  Confront him.  You know where it will get you.  Your  whole marriage will unravel, and you'll have nothing.  All the  things you take for granted -- month-long vacations in St. Lucia  -- they'll disappear.  You'll be a divorced woman in her late  30s.  Lonely.
GWEN	Why did I invite you over?  You make me feel like shit.
JOANNE	That's my job. The phone rings.
GWEN	The machine can get it.
JOANNE	I don't monitor calls.  It makes me feel like I'm hiding in my  own home.
VOICE	Gwen, this is David Warren.  Hopefully, a welcome voice from  your past.  My show's on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.
JOANNE	Pick up the phone. Gwen just stares at the machine.
VOICE	I have no idea what you're up to...I hope life is treating you  well.  I heard through a friend of a friend of a friend that  you're still married.  Congratulations.  If you want, give me  a call.  I'm crashing at my sister's.  The number is -- hold  on-- the number is 235-4511.  Hope to hear from you.
CLICK.
GWEN	Wow.
JOANNE	How long has it been?
GWEN	College.
JOANNE	Have you ever seen his show?  It's absolutely dreadful.  I never  miss it.
GWEN	If Josh isn't home, I'll watch it.
JOANNE	Hmm.  It's Kismet, then.
GWEN	What?
JOANNE	A brief liaison with an old flame.  The perfect way to deal with  your anger.
GWEN	You're insane.  You're an insane mother.
JOANNE	It'll be good for your self-esteem.
GWEN	Did it occur to you that maybe he just wants to have coffee?
DAVID'S VOICE	...on hiatus and I'm in town for the weekend.  Are you free for  coffee...or something?
JOANNE	"Coffee...or something."  He's flirting, admit it.  Coffee...or  something.
GWEN	He's stammering.  He's nervous.  He's calling out of the blue!
JOANNE	You're wrong.  I'm right, and I'm going.  But take a tip from  someone who's been there.  Opportunity is knocking, Gwen.  You  have a chance to level the playing field.
JOSH	You're right.  We could use some more color in the living room.
GWEN	Yes?
JOSH	I said you're right.
GWEN	About what?
JOSH	About more color in the living room.
GWEN	Oh.  I'm glad you think so. She leans closer to inspect a new wrinkle.
DESK CLERK	And how many nights will you be staying with us?
GWEN	One.
DESK CLERK	We do have a two-night minimum.
GWEN	Then...two. She hands him the card.
GWEN	I'd like to pay in cash.
DESK CLERK	That won't be a problem.  We just need a credit card imprint  for your incidentals...
DESK CLERK	...which we tear up when you check out. Gwen smiles.
DESK CLERK	Will you be needing more than one key?
GWEN	Two, please.
DAVID WARREN	I'm still reeling.  It was the most humbling experience of my  life.  Getting raked over the coals by a bunch of sixteen-year  old drama students!  At my own alma mater!
GWEN	I'm surprised they weren't all over you.
DAVID WARREN	They were, with knives drawn.
GWEN	What did they say?
DAVID WARREN	Basically, why am I working on a piece of shit like MALIBU NIGHTS  when I should be doing Shakespeare or Chekhov?
WAITER	Compliments from the table in the corner. The Waiter gestures.  David and Gwen turn.  In the corner three  middle-aged women are smiling.
GWEN	See?  Those women are happy you're not doing Shakespeare. Beat.
DAVID WARREN	Gwen.  You look great.  You haven't changed a bit.
GWEN	I don't think I'm MALIBU NIGHTS material.
DAVID WARREN	Those women!  Walking boob jobs.  They're appalling.
GWEN	You look like you enjoy kissing them.
DAVID WARREN	It's very simple.  I close my eyes and imagine I'm kissing someone  else.
GWEN	Hmm.  Someone else in particular?
DAVID WARREN	Yes.
GWEN	If she's as tan as you, I don't want to hear about it. David reaches for his wallet.
DAVID WARREN	Here, take a look... He hands her a photo.  In it, we see David standing with a distinguished  man in his mid-40s.  With them is a smiling boy, about eleven.
DAVID WARREN	What's wrong with this picture, huh? She smiles.
GWEN	Well...Let's start with the man, upper left.
DAVID WARREN	Andy.  My partner.  And the best thing that's ever happened to  me.
GWEN	Okay.  And the boy?
DAVID WARREN	Eric.  He's Andy's son from a marriage that -- needless to say  -- didn't work.  Andy came out when Eric was just five.  Great  kid.
GWEN	And when did you...?
DAVID WARREN	Come out?  About fifteen years ago. (off Gwen's look) Is this too much information?
GWEN	No.  But fifteen years ago...That was right after--
DAVID WARREN	You and me.
GWEN	Was I the last woman? David nods.
GWEN	Was I that bad? David laughs.
DAVID WARREN	No, you were fantastic.  I was completely confused. Gwen quickly gulps down some champagne.
DAVID WARREN	What's the matter?
GWEN	Nothing.  I'm very happy for you.  And, I have to confess, I'm  relieved.
DAVID WARREN	Why? Beat.
GWEN	Oh -- what the hell -- we're friends, right?
DAVID WARREN	I'm listening.
GWEN	I had this ridiculous idea that you wanted to get together to  have a...
DAVID WARREN	Oh.
GWEN	You know...for old time's sake.
DAVID WARREN	Uh-huh.
GWEN	And, frankly, I wasn't looking forward to turning you down.   Which I would have, of course.  Had you...asked.  Which you're  not, because you're...you're...
DAVID WARREN	Married.
GWEN	Right.
DAVID WARREN	Happily.
GWEN	Right. She slides her empty glass toward him.
GWEN	Would you pour me a little more, David?
DESK CLERK	Can I help you, ma'am? Gwen looks lost.
DESK CLERK	Are you okay?
GWEN	I'd like to check out.
DESK CLERK	Was there a problem?
GWEN	Yes.  I was stood up...by the past. Beat.
DESK CLERK	I'm sorry.  We won't charge you for the room.
GWEN	No, you don't understand.
DESK CLERK	Yes.  I do. (beat) More than you might think. Gwen stares at him.
DESK CLERK	Shall I close out the account?
GWEN	No.  I need the room after all. (beat) Will you show me the way there? The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest.
DESK CLERK	You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break.
DESK CLERK	Something from the mini-bar?
GWEN	No.
DESK CLERK	How's the air conditioning?
GWEN	Fine.
DESK CLERK	Shall I pull down the covers?
GWEN	I suppose.
DESK CLERK	Do you want to know my name?
GWEN	No. He takes her in his arms.
DESK CLERK	You're shaking.
GWEN	I'll be fine. (beat) This could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right?
DESK CLERK	I don't care.
GWEN	You don't even know me.
DESK CLERK	You're right.
GWEN	We have nothing in common. Beat.
DESK CLERK	That's where you're wrong. He begins to unbutton her blouse.  Without touching.  Without  affection.  After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt.
DESK CLERK	(to the Maid) Buenas tardes, se�ora.
GWEN	Thank you for taking care of the room.
DESK CLERK	Your welcome. And they ride in silence. In Gwen's mind--
GWEN	...And now the score is tied...Oh my God, what will I tell my  mother?  I did it with a desk clerk.  Hardly the affair to remember...Of  course, she will disapprove.  "Is English even his first language?  field?  You don't even know the boy's name--"
GWEN	What's your name?
DESK CLERK	David.
GWEN	What?  You're kidding me. Gwen laughs -- she can't help it.
DAVID	No.  What's so funny?
GWEN	Nothing, it's just-- She laughs even harder.  The elevator door opens.  David gets  out and looks at her oddly.
GWEN	Sorry, I just...I didn't think you'd be named David.
DESK CLERK #2	There's a woman waiting to see you.  She's been here for half  an hour.
DAVID	Why are you here?
ROSALIE	You weren't going to return my calls.
DAVID	Don't you have more important things to do?  Picking flowers,  honeymoon reservations...
ROSALIE	Is there somewhere we can talk? The desk phone rings.  David picks it up.
DAVID	(into phone) Front desk, David speaking...No, sir.  Tap water is very drinkable  in this city...Of course, sir.  We'll send up some bottled water  right away.
ROSALIE	Is there somewhere we can talk?
DAVID	What's wrong with here?
ROSALIE	Privately.
DAVID	But here, I won't be tempted to raise my voice or do something  rash.  That's the first lesson of hotel management.  Never lose  your cool, no matter how annoying the guest is.  Not that I plan  to go into hotel management.  I don't have ambitions in that  direction.  Or any direction, if I recall you correctly.
DAVID	(into phone) Front desk, David speaking...Yes, ma'am, the restaurant has a  smoking section...Well, I didn't make the policy...If it's any  consolation, the smokers are seated in a little corner of the  patio, and they feel very bad about themselves.
DAVID	Rosie, you'd better leave.  Before I get myself fired. She starts to protest.  Thinks better of it, and exits.
HOTEL MANAGER	Yo, fiddler on the roof. David reacts -- this is the last person he wants to deal with.
HOTEL MANAGER	(regards the violin) Wish I could play an instrument.  Chicks really dig that stuff.
DAVID	Discipline.  Always a struggle.
HOTEL MANAGER	I hear you.  For instance, it takes a certain discipline to know  that when you're working at the hotel, when you're on the clock...
DAVID	It won't happen again.
HOTEL MANAGER	Good. David marches away.
ROSALIE.	She's been waiting.
DAVID	Jesus! She simply picks up where they left off--
ROSALIE	I want you to be there on Sunday.
DAVID	No.
ROSALIE	You told me we'd always be friends.
DAVID	I lied.
ROSALIE	You're an important part of my life, David.  There's so much  history between us.  I don't want to trash it simply because--
DAVID	Because what?  Because you're getting married? Beat.
DAVID	Rosie, I want you to be happy.  I do.  And someday, we'll be  friends.  Someday, we'll all go out to dinner.  The four of us.
ROSALIE	The four of us?
DAVID	Sure.  Me, you, Jerry, and whatever pale imitation of you I can  dig up to be my date.
ROSALIE	Stop it. But he's on a roll--
DAVID	And the check will come and Jerry will pick up the tab and I'll  protest, but not too much.  Then, you'll give me a kiss on the  cheek, and some dim memory will stir in me, but not for too long.  to see you...
WEDDING PLANNER	We've  got a few more things to cover.  The photos.  There's  a courtyard behind the church.  It's a popular backdrop.  Our  photographer says the light is gorgeous.  We need twenty minutes  before the ceremony for singles.
JERRY	I know.  It is an election year.
WEDDING PLANNER	Exactly what he said.
ROSALIE	It's okay.
WEDDING PLANNER	Right.  The guest list.  We have a few more no-show's. She consults a list.
WEDDING PLANNER	Mr. and Mrs. Bennett send their regrets.  Also, Ms. Rothman will  no be attending.
ROSALIE	Oh.  David Freeman.  He's not coming. Jerry reacts.
JERRY	He's not?
ROSALIE	No.  He's not.
JERRY	After all that shit you put me through, now he's not even coming.
WEDDING PLANNER	So, if there are any last-minute--
JERRY	(ignores her) I guess that means you've been talking with him.
ROSALIE	Yes, I talked to him.  And I... (to Wedding Planner) Would you excuse us for a minute?
WEDDING PLANNER	Take your time. Rosalie gets up and leads Jerry into--
ROSALIE	I talked to David.  And...I uninvited him.
JERRY	What?
ROSALIE	I told him it wasn't right.  I told him he shouldn't be at our  wedding.
JERRY	When did you decide this?
ROSALIE	I don't know...I just realized I don't want our wedding to be  about where I've been.  I want it to be about where you and I  are going.
JERRY	What did he say?
ROSALIE	Jerry...
JERRY	I want to know.
ROSALIE	He was disappointed--
JERRY	Of course he was.  He's still in love with you.
ROSALIE	But he understands.  I drew the line, honey.
JERRY	Thank-you.
ROSALIE	I did it for us. Rosalie gives him a kiss.
DAVID	(into phone) What do you want, Rose?
ROSALIE	Were you sleeping?
DAVID	Yes.  I was.
ROSALIE	Liar.  You're practicing.  I can hear you. He moves to the window.
DAVID'S POV	Rosalie -- on her cell -- waves to him from the sidewalk, three  stories below.
ROSALIE	It's so sad.  Why do you always play sad songs?
DAVID	I don't write 'em, Rose. (beat) Is our conversation over now?
ROSALIE	Please let me in.
DAVID	No. She laughs mischievously.
ROSALIE	You don't trust me?
DAVID	No. (beat) Stay there.  I'll be right...Wait a minute.  This is insane.
ROSALIE	I'm going to wait here for one minute.  Sixty seconds.
DAVID	You do that.
ROSALIE	Then, I'm gone.  You won't see me again. She hangs up.  He hangs up.
DAVID'S POV	Rosalie sits on the front steps.  Stubborn.
DAVID	(to himself) Be my guest.  Sit there all night. David turns from the window.  He accidentally knocks his metronome  to the floor, setting it off.  Click...click...click...
DAVID	If I go down those stairs...it will only lead to one place...right  back here...the two of us...a short, brilliant moment...one more  to add to the gallery...then, empty-handed again, with nothing  to show for it but an emotional hangover...I'm not going to open  this door... Discipline... Like the man said, don't fuck the  guests...
DAVID	I've got nothing to say to you.
ROSALIE	Fine.  I'll talk... A beat.
ROSALIE	The reason I won't just leave you alone is not because I'm "confused."  that I can love Jerry and love you.  And that one love has nothing  to do with the other.  But it's true.
DAVID	Rose...
ROSALIE	What?
DAVID	This is bullshit.  I can't spell it out any more plainly.  It's  impossible!
ROSALIE	Why?
DAVID	Because I can't be this close to you...and not want to touch  you.
ROSALIE	That's it?
DAVID	That's...it. And he does touch her.  He puts his hand on her leg.
DAVID	And if I can't do that, I don't want to be your friend.  Not  now.  Not ever.
ROSALIE	Don't be so mean. David flashes an angry look.  Then, he pulls Rosalie close to  him.
DAVID	The bottom line is...If I'm with you, I have to touch you, to  kiss you.  That doesn't work for friends, does it?
DAVID	When I'm not with you -- this is more than you need to know...If  I touch myself, I can only think about one person. You.  No one  else.  Just you.
ROSALIE	What do we do?
DAVID	What do you mean "we"?  This is your problem. (beat) My only problem is how to get you out of my mind.  How to erase  you...Delete every bit of you...
ROSALIE	Stop... She kisses him.  He engulfs her in his arms.
DAVID	You have to say good-bye.
ROSALIE	I don't know how...
DAVID	Should we stop? Rosalie is too choked up to answer -- she shakes her head "no."
ROSALIE	David, will you hand me my shampoo?  It's in my purse. David opens Rosalie's purse and finds a travel-size bottle of  shampoo.
ROSALIE	Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of thy womb Jesus...Holy  Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour  of our death, Amen...Hail Mary, full of Grace, blessed be the  fruit of...
ON ROSALIE	She nudges him.  He doesn't stir.  Rosalie sits at the foot of  the bed.  She grabs the remote and "un-mutes" the sound.
EXPERT	...And the change is not just physical.  You'll be amazed how  quickly your whole outlook will--
JERRY	Hey...
ROSALIE	Hey...
JERRY	What time is it?
ROSALIE	Late. He looks at the time.
JERRY	It is late.  What happened?
ROSALIE	Oh.  The girls.  Wedding talk.  We could've gone on all night.
ROSALIE	Jerry...
JERRY	What?
ROSALIE	We need to make love now.
JERRY	Okay...why now?
ROSALIE	I can't explain it.  We just need to make love now. He nods.  He kisses her neck, her breasts. Suddenly she stops him, taking his face in her hands.
JERRY	What's the matter?
ROSALIE	I just need to fix this moment in my mind. A long beat.  She studies his face.
ROSALIE	I love you.  Totally.  Completely.  I don't want to spend another  minute of my life without you.
JERRY	You're forgetting something.
ROSALIE	No, I'm not. He laughs uncomfortably.
JERRY	Don't you think...
ROSALIE	No, I don't.  Let's not use it tonight. (beat) I'm ready. A beat.
JERRY	If you're ready, so am I. She straddles him, rocking back and forth.  With grim determination.
ROSALIE	Jerry?
JERRY	What?
ROSALIE	Talk to me...
FLASH!	rOSALIE I know. (beat) But I also know you would've enjoyed it more if I hadn't...
FLASH...FLASH!	rOSALIE I won't.  I promise. cUT TO:
PRIEST	A lot of young couples prefer "husband and wife" to the traditional  "man and wife."  Personally, I don't feel the phrase "man and  wife" gives the woman a diminutive status.  But I leave the choice  in your hands.  Do you have a--
ROSALIE	Husband and wife.  Definitely. Jerry simply nods.
PRIEST	Good. (to Jerry) After the blessing, I'll instruct you to kiss the bride.  Keep  it simple.  No slobbering.
ROSALIE	That could be tough.  For him. The Priest feigns amusement.
PRIEST	Remember, this is God's house.  And there will be prominent people  here as well.  Not to mention the press.  So, let's keep things  on the up-and-up.
FATHER	Here we are.  Bahia Gold.  Two hundred a box.
JERRY	You don't have to do this, Dad.
FATHER	If I can't come to the bachelor party, I want to be there in  spirit.
JERRY	Thank-you.
FATHER	I remember my bachelor night.  Frankly, I wish I didn't.  Not  a night I'm particularly proud of...I'll leave it at that.
JERRY	Why are you sharing this?
FATHER	Reminiscing.  That's all.
JERRY	Or warning me.
FATHER	Nonsense.  I know you.  You won't make an ass out of yourself.
JERRY	What's this?
FATHER	It's a key. (smiles) There's a new housing development, just west of here.  I've been  giving the developer a lot of breaks, and...now he's giving me  one in return.  I'm almost embarrassed to say how little this  cost me.
JERRY	I can't accept this.
FATHER	Yes, you can. (beat) C'mon.  Make your old man happy. Jerry says nothing.
FATHER	Uh-huh.  I get it.  This is Rosalie's domain.  She should have  a say in where you two settle down.  But don't worry, you won't  be forcing her hand.  Know why?  Because she's going to love  it.
FATHER	Let's ring these babies up.
BEST FRIEND	Alright, my man.  You ready?
JERRY	Do I have a choice?
BEST FRIEND	No.
JERRY	Then, I'm ready.
BEST FRIEND	The guys pitched in for this... He pats Jerry on the back.
BEST FRIEND	So go up there and get our money's worth. Jerry starts up--
JERRY	Why am I stopping?...There's a hot girl waiting on the other  side of the door...Why worry?  Everyone cuts you slack for this  kind of thing...This is supposed to happen...It's a tradition,  a time-honored ritual...Losing your tooth, losing your virginity,  losing the championship...If I walk through this door, what am  I losing?  Nothing...My father was here, and his father was here,  and his father's father was here, hand on the door...What am  I waiting for...
LORNA	Sitting on the bed in a tank-top and a short skirt.  As fetching  as ever.
LORNA	You must be the groom. Jerry laughs.
LORNA	The guys were right.  You're a looker.
JERRY	Did they also tell you I don't usually do this kind of thing.
LORNA	All the better.  I like challenges. She crosses to face him.
LORNA	Getting married tomorrow, huh?
JERRY	Yes, I am.
LORNA	Love, honor, and obey.  That's the drill, isn't it?
JERRY	Yes.  Tomorrow, I take the vows. Without much ceremony, she starts massaging his crotch.
LORNA	Tomorrow...So, technically, this doesn't count.
JERRY	How's that?
LORNA	You can't break a vow you haven't taken, can you?
JERRY	You sound like my lawyer. Lorna kneels down before him.  She unzips his pants.
LORNA	I've done my share of lawyers.  They spend most of the hour negotiating  the tip.
JERRY	I got it. She pulls down his pants, looks up at him.
LORNA	Something bothering you?
JERRY	I don't know if I should be doing this. She starts to stroke him.
LORNA	Want my philosophy?  If we don't make mistakes now and then,  how are we ever going to learn from them?
JERRY	Now you sound like my priest.
LORNA	I've done a few of them, too.
JERRY	Priests?
LORNA	Lousy tippers.  They spend most of the hour feeling bad about  what they're doing.  But they do it anyway.  Then, they shortchange  you on the tip.  One of them absolved me once, before he left.
JERRY	Who are the best tippers?
LORNA	The guys who can least afford it.  Guys with families.
JERRY	And the worst?
LORNA	Hands-down.  Politicians. Jerry reacts.
JERRY	Politicians?
LORNA	Sure.  Both parties.  I don't discriminate.  Besides, a penis  doesn't know from politics.  A penis is the most politically  incorrect part of the body.  It has a simple agenda.
JERRY	Stop it.  I can't do it.
LORNA	Don't worry about it.
JERRY	I can't...I'm sorry. Lorna instinctively puts a little distance between herself and  Jerry.
LORNA	Hey, it's no sweat.  I get paid either way.
JERRY	No, you don't understand.  I can't fucking go through with it!
JERRY	Jesus! Adrenaline pumping, he doesn't even notice the blood on his hand.
ON LORNA	She shakes her head --  she's completely nonplussed.
LORNA	That was smart.   Now, you're bleeding.  Here... She takes him by the arm into--
LORNA	Better?
JERRY	Yeah...
LORNA	Do you love her?
JERRY	I don't know.
LORNA	C'mon.  Let's sit down. They return to--
JERRY	She wants to have a baby.  That's the way it's supposed to be,  right?
LORNA	I wouldn't know.
JERRY	My parents approve of her.  Her parents approve of me.  Everybody  approves...
LORNA	What's wrong with a little approval? Jerry gives her a hard look.
JERRY	That's my whole life.  My whole goddam carrot-and-stick-life.  or that person's approval.  Playing one role, then another.   Then another!  The good student.  The good son.  The industrious  boy.  Good grades.  High ambitions.  Pats on the back.  Handshakes  from people who matter!  The good boyfriend, getting on his knees  and proposing to the good girlfriend.  The dutiful bachelor,  receiving the traditional blow-job from a...
LORNA	(lets him off the hook) Professional.
JERRY	I've lost count of all the roles, there's so many of them. (beat) I have no idea who I'm playing now.
LORNA	Huh. A beat.
LORNA	I don't see what the big deal is.  I play roles all the time.
JERRY	And you want to do that your entire life?  You can't...you...
LORNA	Lorna.  And I'll do whatever the hell I want.
JERRY	Well, I can't live somebody else's version of my life anymore.
LORNA	Sure.  I do. She gets up and crosses to the window.  Lifts it up.
LORNA	Here's your chance.
JERRY	What?
LORNA	It's not too far a drop to the lawn.  You have gas in your car?
HIS POV	The suburbs at night.  Cozy, warm-lit.
JERRY	I'm going to do it. He smiles at Lorna.  Then, he climbs out the window.
LORNA'S POV	She watches him hit the ground, hobble across the lawn, and get  into his car.  And he's gone.
LORNA	See?  Easy. She sits on the bed, takes in the room.  It seems ordinary and  strange, all at once.
LORNA'S POV	Behind the counter lies a crumpled newspaper.
LORNA	(to Waitress) Mind if I have that?
WAITRESS	It's yesterday's.  Morning paper should be here any minute.
LORNA	I just want the crossword puzzle. The Waitress puts the paper in front of her.  It falls open to  the Metro section, where Lorna sees a photo of Jerry and Rosalie  -- the one Todd shot.
LORNA	Oh my... The Waitress cranes her neck to see.
WAITRESS	There's a catch, alright.
TERRI	Hello...It's the oldest condition known to man.  Cold feet.
LORNA	You're wrong.  I'm telling you he's two states away by now.
TERRI	If you're wrong, you're paying for drinks tonight.
TERRI	Well, what do you know... Lorna can't believe it -- she almost feels betrayed.
TERRI	Told you we should've dressed up.
LORNA	C'mon...we're going inside.
TERRI	What for?  Wait... But Lorna is bounding toward the cathedral.
TERRI	Lorna, we shouldn't be here. Hearing her name Todd looks up.  Then, he gathers his gear and  starts inside.
LORNA	Excuse me, could you tell me who's getting married in... (beat) Hey, I know you.  The wedding guy.
TODD	I'm sorry. Have we met?
LORNA	Yeah.  You don't remember me?
TODD	You must be thinking of somebody else. Lorna reacts.  Stops herself.
LORNA	Right.  I must be thinking of someone else.  Sorry.
TODD	Excuse me... And he disappears into the church.
TERRI	What was that all about?
LORNA	Nothing.
TERRI	Nothing, my ass.
LORNA	Alright, alright.  I slipped.
TERRI	Slipped?  You broke the cardinal rule of the trade. (pedantic) Never acknowledge a client in public.
LORNA	What is this?  Hooking For Dummies?  C'mon... Lorna grabs Terri by the wrist and slips into--
LORNA'S POV	The front pews are packed, all eyes focussed on the wedding party  at the altar.  Jerry and Rosalie face the priest, who blesses  the ring.
PRIEST	The wedding ring is a powerful symbol.  It is a circle, with  no beginning and no end.  It is also the circle that encloses  your love for each other--
TERRI	I'll bet that dress is Vera Wang.
LORNA	Shhh... Jerry and Rosalie turn to face each other.
PRIEST	Do you, Rosalie, take this man, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part?
ROSALIE	I do.
PRIEST	And do you, Jerry, take this woman, to have and to hold, in sickness  and in health, till death do you part?
JERRY	I do.
PRIEST	Then, by the power invested in me by Christ, Our Lord, I now  pronounce you husband and wife.
TERRI	You're crying, I can't believe it.
LORNA	No, I'm not. (beat) Weddings make me cry. The congregation applauds.  Jerry shakes hands with the best  man -- his Father.  He gives his son an approving pat on the  back.
SECURITY GUARD	Ladies, this event is strictly for invited guests.
TERRI	We're with the groom's party.
SECURITY GUARD	Ma'am...Let's not do this.  You're not with the groom. Terri points to Lorna.
TERRI	She had his cock in her mouth last night.  Doesn't that count?
LORNA	I don't know why he came back. (beat) It wasn't love.
TERRI	Guess you'll never know for sure. They start down the sidewalk--
TERRI	Remember the guy I told you about -- the writer?
LORNA	Yeah.  He said he wanted to immortalize you.  What a line.
TERRI	He's been steady work.  Every Tuesday for the past month.  Well,  get this.  Yesterday, he called and asked me out.
LORNA	On a date?
TERRI	Yeah.  A date.
LORNA	A non-paying date.
TERRI	No money will be exchanged.  You want to hear the weird part?
LORNA	You're right.  That is weird.
TERRI	You gotta keep an open mind, Lorna. (beat) You never know with people. They wait at the crosswalk.  Lorna idly glances at the window  of a brownstone apartment.
WHAT LORNA SEES	A Man finishing a cigarette.  He catches Lorna looking his way.  The Man gives Lorna a last look before pulling the curtains closed.
TERRI	C'mon, what are you waiting for?
ON LORNA	She lingers at the curb for a moment, pondering her next move.
