Crazy, Stupid, Love

CAL	Well, I'm full. You were right, hon. I shouldn't have eaten all that bread. Want to just share a dessert? Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
CAL	You okay, babe? You seem out of it.
TRACY	Yeah, I'm just thinking about what I want.
CAL	Me too. Okay, let's say it at the same time. One. Two. Three...
TRACY CAL	I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.
JESSICA	I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna  getcha! She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with  delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the nearby console. Jessica picks it up:
JESSICA	It's okay, my fault. Alright, kiddo, it's getting late, let's get you to bed before your parents get home. Don't give me the puppy eyes, you little maniac. Go brush your teeth! Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.
HANNAH	I don't care. I love him and given the opportunity, I'd have his babies. Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.
LIZ	Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd do Conan O'Brien?
HANNAH	I'm just saying, Richard's a lot  of things: successful, smart...
LIZ	Boring, workaholic, sexually  repressed...
HANNAH	But he's not very funny, that's  all.
LIZ	Yeah, well, you want funny, go watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a good lay, go get yourself some of... that. She motions off to the side.
HANNAH	What?
LIZ	The hot piece that's been checking you out for the last hour. THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The  smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He tilts his glass at them, toasting.
TRACY	Aren't you going to say anything? Nothing.
TRACY	Almost twenty-five years of marriage, you have nothing to say? She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward. It's silent. Devastating.
JESSICA	Hey, your sister's asleep, just checking you're alive -- She SCREAMS as --
ANOTHER ANGLE	ROBBIE WEAVER (13), quickly covers himself up. He was  masturbating.
ROBBIE	Close the door!
JESSICA	I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see  anything, I swear.
LIZ	I don't know, Hannah. Your life is just so... PG-13.  Hannah's mouth drops open.
HANNAH	My life is not PG-13!
LIZ	It so is. You've never left LA.  You pass the bar you're gonna be, what, a patent lawyer, probably married to that snooze-fest Richard. I just worry about you is all. Hell, you've resorted to fantasizing about Conan `Ginger-  Dick' O'Brien.
HANNAH	He's funny.
LIZ	He looks like a carrot, honey. Hannah LAUGHS.
LIZ	Hi.
JACOB	Hi. Who looks like a carrot?
LIZ	Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah thinks he's sexy.
JACOB	I think your friend Hannah is sexy. Hannah LAUGHS.
HANNAH	You didn't really just say that.
JACOB	Pretty sure I did.
HANNAH	How old are you?
JACOB	Thirty-three next month.
HANNAH	Then you should know by now that cheesy pick-up lines don't work. Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.
JACOB	I find you incredibly sexy. It's a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.
JACOB	There are many attractive women in this bar -- including your friend here -- and I've been unable to take my eyes off you, only you, for the past two hours. Again: not a cheesy pick-up line, just a fact. Answer this quickly, without thinking about your answer: do you find me attractive? Hannah doesn't flinch.
HANNAH	I don't.
JACOB	Yes you do.
LIZ	Yes, she does.
JACOB	I'm an accomplished lover. If you come home with me, I am confident you will leave satisfied.  Multiple times.
HANNAH	You've got to be kiddi--
JACOB	We'll make love and it will be amazing. You'll laugh afterwards and say `I never do this kind of thing.' Then you'll do it again.
HANNAH	Is that so?
JACOB	It is. So now I'm going to ask if I can buy you another drink. If you say yes, we'll have one more cocktail each -- just enough to start losing inhibitions, not enough to get sloppy, after all: I promised to satisfy you.
LIZ	Multiple times.
JACOB	That's right. So, here we go, Hannah: can I buy you a drink? Hannah and Liz share a look.
HANNAH	What do you expect me to say to that?
JACOB	Margarita, rocks, salt.
HANNAH	Wow. She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand.
HANNAH	Okay, time to go. Liz doesn't move.
LIZ	I'll go home with you, you can call me Hannah, I don't give a
CRAP --
HANNAH	Liz!
LIZ	(whispering to him) Another time, maybe. GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar.
TRACY	I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not to be. We've been married so long, somewhere we became... stagnant, you know? He keeps staring straight ahead.
TRACY	Okay, you're not talking and you  know that only makes me talk more.  Maybe that's good, maybe that's  good. Okay...
TRACY
	There's this person.  No response.
TRACY	We've been spending time together.  Lunches, meetings, that kind of  stuff...  Silence. She closes her eyes tightly.
TRACY	I slept with him. Kind of.  Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing.
TRACY	No, no kind of. I can't believe I  said kind of. That's just not  something you do in a kind of way.  I slept with someone. There. I  said it. I slept with someone.  Oh God. It's the worst thing I've  ever done but it feels so good to  say out loud. I slept with  someone. I SLEPT with someone. I  slept with SOMEONE. I slept with  ... please stop me, please say  something.  No reaction.
TRACY	David Jacobowitz. From work. You met him at the Christmas party.  You remember that party? They had  the giant paper-machï¿½ wreath? I  kept asking the decorator how he  made it? You wore that sweater --  Finally, Cal speaks --
CAL	Please stop.
TRACY	The last person in the world I'd ever want to hurt was you, Cal --
CAL	If you keep talking, I'm going to get out of the car.
TRACY	But the fact that I did, that it  could happen at all, I think it  just shows how broken we are and --
CAL	Okay. Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and, simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying. She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her rearview mirror.
TRACY	Are you out of your mind!? He looks up at her, pleading.
CAL	I'll leave tonight, I'll sign whatever you want me to sign, if you'll just stop talking about it. She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's still something here.
TRACY	Okay.
CAL	Okay. He stands, limps back to the car.
ROBBIE	I'm sorry that you had to see that. She keeps staring straight ahead.
JESSICA	I should have knocked.
ROBBIE	For the record: I think about you while I do it --
JESSICA	Robbie!
ROBBIE	I have a picture of you and I look at it the whole time --
JESSICA	Stop it!
ROBBIE	I love you, Jessica. And I know you're seventeen, and I know I just turned thirteen, which is the  same age as your little brother,  and you're technically my baby- sitter, but someday soon our age difference will be inconsequential which is good because...
JESSICA
ROBBIE --
ROBBIE	I'm pretty sure you're my soulmate. She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.
JESSICA	Listen, Robbie --
ROBBIE	Shit. Jessica jumps off the couch.
JESSICA	Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was dinner... Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're bleeding. Why are you bleeding?
CAL	Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a divorce so I jumped out of the car. Hope the kids behaved. Come on, I'll drive you home. Robbie steps INTO FRAME.
ROBBIE	Dad?
CAL	Oh. I didn't know you were here.
ROBBIE	You're getting divorced?
CAL	Yes.
TRACY	Cal!
ROBBIE	And you jumped out of a car?
CAL	A moving car, yes.
TRACY	Cal!
CAL	I'm sorry you found out this way.
ROBBIE	I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.
CAL	Thanks. Jessica, you got your coat?
JESSICA	Uh-huh.
CAL	We'll talk to the kids tomorrow. Tell them we're separating. Just separating. We'll do it together. He thinks.
CAL	I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch, she's gonna be crushed. But not right now. She's got enough to worry about... He trails off. Another long beat of silence, then he remembers his company and turns toward Jessica.
CAL	So, I hear Stanford early  admission, huh. I know your dad is so proud.
JESSICA	Yeah. You're bleeding real bad, Mr. Weaver. She goes to touch his eye. Out of nowhere... he starts BANGING THE SHIT out of his steering wheel.
CAL	David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!
CAL	Sorry about that.
JESSICA	It's okay. Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a deep breath, adorable.
JESSICA	Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know me very well, but I've been baby- sitting for your family for three years. You're the nicest dad of any of the families I baby-sit for, by a country mile.
JESSICA	You're funny, and you're always really generous, and you're the only dad who's excited -- genuinely excited -- to check on his kids when he gets home from dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I like her a lot, but if she wants to divorce you, well... then I think she's batshit crazy. Cal smiles, distracted but grateful.
JESSICA	In fact -- and, I hope this doesn't make you uncomfortable -- I think I've even developed a
LITTLE CRUS--
CAL	Hey: do me a favor -- can you not mention what's going on between Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents? It's probably better they hear it from us. Okay?
JESSICA	Uh-huh.
CAL	That's my girl. Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.
CAL	Hey, Jessica? Thanks for listening. She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees... He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.
CAL	You put this to that fake ID you'll need up at Stanford.  And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.
BARTENDER	Another vodka cranberry?
CAL	Yes. Just... yes. A GIRL (30s) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder, a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen.
CAL	Guess what?
GIRL	What?
CAL	My wife is having intercourse with someone who isn't me.
GIRL	I'm sorry to hear that.
CAL	That's very nice of you to say. She just told me tonight, obviously it came as a bit of a shock and you're not listening anymore. The Girl has turned back to a group of friends.
CAL	I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I were David Jacobowitz. My wife doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz. (to no one)  She screws him.  Something catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO...
JACOB PALMER	wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO  BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table.  Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the  bartender, and decides:
CAL
	Gay.
WOMAN	So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2  is a lot like unit 1 except you're  downstairs so... the ground is  closer. Which is nice.
CAL	I guess the price is right.
WOMAN	Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys  here. You'll fit right in.  Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.
CAL	I'll take it.
WOMAN	Ooh, the gym has an elliptical  machine... I assume you want to  get back in shape?  Cal looks down, embarrassed.
CAL	I guess.
WOMAN	Great! I'll let you know when  they fix it.
BOSS	Cal, I just got the weekly sales  report, good good good! You  really killed this quarter!
BOSS	Keep it up you're going to be  sitting in my seat by year's end.  Really great, Cal. Seriously.
CAL	Who told you Tracy and I were  getting a divorce?
BOSS
	Divorce! That's it. Amy heard  you crying in the bathroom. We  all thought it was cancer. Thank  God.
CAL	I have to go buy furniture now.  Cal stands, EXITS.
BOSS	Go for it!  (then, calling after)  It could have been cancer, buddy!
SALESMAN	Can I help you, sir?
CAL	My wife is sleeping with David  Jacobowitz. I need a couch.
SALESMAN	Ooh, I understand. Can I give you  a word of advice, one divorced man  to another? If you don't mind?
CAL	Sure.
SALESMAN	Get the matching chaise, killer  deal.  He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.
CAL	I want it in beige.
SALESMAN	I'll write you up.
CAL	Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for  a friend.
GUY	You've been holding the seat for  an hour.
CAL
	Yeah, well, my wife is screwing  David Jacobowitz so eat me.  The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts  a napkin on his drink, and stands.
CAL	Can't help but notice that you're  always surrounded by women.  Multiple women.  Jacob doesn't even turn.
CAL	I'm getting divorced. Or, in the  process. Gonna be single again.  Nothing.
CAL	Any advice?
JACOB	Yeah.
JACOB	Don't start conversations with  people while they're pissing.  He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS. A beat, then:
CAL
	So gay.
BERNIE	Sorry I'm late, I had to pick  something up from Macy's.
CAL	Don't worry about it, here, sit,  I've been guarding this stool with  my life.  Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable.
CAL	It's good to see you, man. I've  called you a few times. It's been  a rough couple of days, obviously.  Nothing I could use more than my  old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey,  we should play racquetball, when's  the last time we played  racquetball?
BERNIE	Claire won't let me be friends  with you anymore.  Cal takes this in.
CAL	I'm sorry, what?
BERNIE	She said we had to choose between  you and Tracy. I chose you. She  said no.
BERNIE	It's cologne.
CAL	Are you breaking up with me?
BERNIE	Claire's waiting in the car.  Um... there's a gift receipt in  there. Sorry.  Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder,  lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS.  Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender.
CAL	Do you have anything with a worm  in it? Because I'd like a gallon  of that now.
ON JACOB	Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get  dumped this whole time.  He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting, untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair. Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something  to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods,  gets up and walks away.
CAL	This is my youngest, Molly. Her two favorite things are High School Musical and her mother. I hate both of her two favorite things. A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob. Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob makes is practiced, perfectly cool.
JACOB	Jacob Palmer.
CAL
CAL WEA--
JACOB	I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL	I already have a drink.
JACOB	Let me buy you a drink, Cal.
CAL	Okay. Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS.
CAL	My wife is cheating on me with --
JACOB	David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've heard. We've all heard. For the last two nights, I've watched you  batter every poor soul in this bar with your sad-sack loser sob story. Cal takes this in. He STANDS.
CAL	You know what, I don't need this
CRAP --
JACOB	Sit down, Cal.
CAL	Okay. Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.
JACOB	Cal, I'm going to make you an offer, it's probably the best offer you're ever going to get, and you're extremely drunk, so it's wildly important that you don't answer until I've finished and you've taken a few moments to process what I'm saying. Do you understand? Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:
JACOB	As I said, I've been watching you for two days now and I can say,  without hesitation, that you are the sorriest man I've ever seen in my life -- don't interrupt, Cal, it's the truth, and you need to hear it. You're sitting there with your Supercut haircut, getting drunk on watered down vodka-cranberries like a fourteen- year-old girl, wearing a 41R jacket when you should be wearing a 40L -- I don't know if I want to help you or euthanize you -- stop drinking out of the goddamn straw, Cal.  Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw.
JACOB	You asked me for advice before,  Cal, so I'm going to help you. I  don't know why. Maybe I'm just bored. Maybe all my friends have abandoned me for wives and children and labradoodle puppies, who cares why? Why doesn't matter. The point is, you've got a good face, and a good head of hair, and I'm bored as hell and need a project. So if you want, I'm going to help you rediscover your manhood. Do you remember when it was that you lost it?  Cal shakes "no."
JACOB	Doesn't matter, we'll find it. And when we do, when I'm through with you, that wife of yours is going to rue the day she decided to give up on you too early. That's my offer. What do you say? Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.
CAL	Yeah, okay.
JACOB	Mall food court, Thursday, six o'clock.
CAL	I'm sorry, what? Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby).
JACOB	You ready to go?  She nods, subservient, and follows him out. Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.
HIS BACKYARD	A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can  tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball  equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son  catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.  You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this  backyard. You like this family a lot from seeing this  backyard.
TRACY	I just wanted to say that...  Her voice cracks. She turns away.
TRACY	Shit.  She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells  him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops  himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and  complicated about the reality of it all.  Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to  lighten things.
TRACY	Do you want me to back that thing  out of the driveway for you?
CAL	I'll be fine.
TRACY	You have trouble in reverse is  all.
CAL	It was two times --
TRACY	Three if you count my father's  foot.
CAL	I did that on purpose.
TRACY	I knew it.  They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize,  stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.
CAL	Once I'm settled, I'll get the  kids so they can see the place.  He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.
TRACY	I think I'm have a mid-life crisis  maybe. Can women have mid-life  crisis?
CAL
	Make sure the lawn gets enough  water.
TRACY	In the movies it's always men  having them and buying ridiculous  yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man  and I really don't want a yellow
PORSCHE --
CAL	You have to fertilize once a  month. Not twice a month, not  once every two months.  She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.
TRACY	We got married so young, Cal. And  I'm forty-one. And that's so much  older than I thought I'd be.
CAL	The sprinklers turn off behind  you.
TRACY	And I got really upset with an  umpire at Molly's t-ball game last  month -- like really upset, like I  screamed at him and wished he  would die -- and I started feeling  like the person I promised I  wouldn't turn into, you know?
CAL	If it rains a lot, you need to  shut off the automatic setting.
TRACY	And we haven't been us, not for a  long time. And I don't know when  you and I stopped being `us'  but... I mean, do you?  Cal finally turns and looks at her.
CAL	I think it was when you screwed  David Jacobowitz.  Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods:  she also understands it.
CAL	Make sure my azaleas get enough  sun.  Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out...  And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.
CAL	Okay, well, this is it. What do you think? Didn't have a lot of time to house-hunt, but... They look around his depressing, beige apartment. A  pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner.
CAL	There's a second bedroom with twin beds so you two can stay over whenever you want! Anytime!
ROBBIE	So... you're like, actually going  to live here? Molly looks like she's going to cry.
CAL	Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll visit all the time. Every weekend. It won't be that bad.
MOLLY	Don't you love us anymore? Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.
CAL	Listen, baby. What's happening with your mommy and I... it's not what either of us wanted, not what either of us planned.
CAL	But you need to understand that you kids have done nothing wron--
MOLLY	TROY!
ROBBIE	Don't take it personally. That show's like crack to her. Cal NODS.
ROBBIE	You okay?
CAL	You? Robbie shrugs.
ROBBIE	Can I say something with a curse? One time?
CAL	Yeah. Why not? Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.
ROBBIE	Love is fucked.  Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.
CAL	Is that so? You in love, buddy?
ROBBIE	Well, if you must know --
ROBBIE	What is she doing here?
CAL	Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for
COMING --
CAL	(back to Robbie) I have to run out really quickly, just for a few hours, and your mother wants you to stay here while she's out hooking --
ROBBIE	What?
CAL	Huh?
JESSICA	The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver.
CAL	Yes, well, that's a generous adjective, thank you. Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye on you guys for a few.
ROBBIE	But I don't need a babysitter! She's only four years older than me! You need to know that! She needs to know that!
CAL	I know, buddy. Cal musses Robbie's hair.
CAL	My little boy's growing up, Jess. He's in love already, can you believe it? Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying.
CAL	Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?  No response, she's glued to the television.
ROBBIE	Wait, where are you going?
CAL	I'm, uh... I decided to take a class.
JESSICA	That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a  difficult time for you, it's important that you find new interests, try new things, maybe things you'd never have considered trying before... Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder. It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.
CAL	Okay, well... Molly, last chance!?  But Molly is still locked on Efron.
CAL	That's my angel. Back in a few.
ROBBIE	But, Dad --
CAL	Nope. The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica, awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.
ROBBIE	I don't need a baby-sitter.
JESSICA	I know, Robbie. An awkward beat, then.
ROBBIE	I love you so much --
JESSICA	Jesus Christ.
CAL	What am I doing?
CAL	What the hell am I doing? He walks past a CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Inside is...  Hannah (girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up).
RICHARD	I think you're wrong. I think that's Tucker.
WHITE MAN	No, no, no. Chris Rock is the stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker is the actor.
WHITE WOMAN	Is it racist that I can't tell them apart? Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a LAUGH. Liz stands.
LIZ	Well, Richard: thank you for inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye' party. The conversation has been riveting, like stepping back in  time. Before I go, a toast. She holds up her glass, toasting.
LIZ	Sweetie: go into your hole and  study your cute little ass off for that bar exam. We'll see you when you emerge.
RICHARD	She's gonna kick that bar's butt! All the dorks CHEER. Liz SHRUGS.
LIZ	Yeah, okay.
HANNAH	I'll walk you out. Before they clear...
RICHARD	Hey, Liz? When my girl passes, we're gonna have another little celebration, right here. Hope you can make it. It's going to be a special night.
LIZ	Richard, you just give me a heads- up so I can get really drunk before-hand, okay?
RICHARD	You know it! Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:
HANNAH	Did you hear that? `It's going to be a special night.' You think he's going to propose?
LIZ	At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh God, I hope not. Why? Do you really want him to? Hannah SHRUGS.
HANNAH	He's nice.
LIZ	Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?  (with a shrug) Okay. Not my life, I love you, call me if you need anything.  Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her  table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES.  She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.
JACOB	You're late. (then, offering) Sbarro's?
CAL	No thanks. So what exactly are
WE --
JACOB	How much money can you afford to spend on clothes today?
CAL	I dunno. Five hundred?
JACOB	Three thousand.
CAL	Okay.
JACOB	We'll start with shoes. Let me see those sneakers you're wearing. Cal holds up his foot.
JACOB	Take them off. Cal bends down, takes one off.
JACOB	Other one too, please? Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes. Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.
CAL	What the hell!?
JACOB	Are you in a fraternity, Cal?
CAL	Those were my favorite shoes.
JACOB	ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?
CAL	No.
JACOB	Are you Steve Jobs?
CAL	What?
JACOB	ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF
CAL	No. I'm not Steve Jobs.
JACOB	Then you don't need to walk around in New Balance Sneaker, ever. Let's go.
CAL	I think this whole thing might have been a bad idea. Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.
JACOB	Any man can rebuild his entire wardrobe with sixteen simple items.
CAL	Ha! I think I read that in GQ.
JACOB	You did. I wrote it.
CAL	Really? Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what the chuckle symbolizes.
JACOB	Numbers one and two: pair of dress shoes, pair of loafers.
CAL	I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you really write for GQ? Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.
JACOB	Your credit card please?
JACOB	Take it in there... and there.
CAL	These are two hundred and thirty dollars. Can't we just go to the Gap? He looks up. Jacob is gone.
CAL	I'm sorry! Don't leave!
JACOB	No, Cal. We can't just go to the Gap.
CAL	What's wrong with the Gap?
JACOB	In Hell, every store is the Gap, that's what's wrong with the Gap, Cal. It's lowest common denominator. Be better than the fucking Gap, Cal.
CAL	I'm very warm.
JACOB	You rub this in around your eyes every night and every morning.
CAL	What does it do?
JACOB	It gives you x-ray vision, Cal. It tightens things up. The skin around your eyes looks like Milton Berle's ballsack. Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror.
CAL	Oh my God, it does.
CAL	I like to use a number four on the sides and the back, go longer on the top.
JACOB	Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor  cut, tight on sides, get him some texture up top, take off about... He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.
CAL	Eww.
JACOB	... inch off the top.
TIFFANY	Yes, sir.
CAL
BUT --	Tiffany starts chopping.
JACOB	What are you putting on?
JACOB	Perfect. (then, to Tiffany) You smell great by the way.
TIFFANY	Thanks.
JACOB	What are you doing tonight?
TIFFANY	I don't know.
JACOB	That's okay, I do. She GIGGLES. Cal calls out.
JACOB	Yes, Cal, just like that.
JACOB TIFFANY	Yes. Yes. Okay, I feel kind of stupid but... The DRESSING ROOM DOOR opens. We TILT UP... FROM expensive shoes, TO pants, TO fitted sweater over a fitted shirt and bright tie. The new haircut... A new man. He looks... unbelievable.
TIFFANY	Wow.
JACOB	Yep.
CAL	Can I blouse out the shirt a little? I like to blouse out my shirts a little.
JACOB	Shut up, Cal. You'd fuck him, right?
CAL	Jesus!
TIFFANY	Yeah, probably.
CAL	Tiffany! (then, realizing) You would!? Tiffany SHRUGS.
JACOB	You see that, Cal? The simple act of opening your mouth instantly causes Tiffany to lose interest in sleeping with you. Your personality is actually your weakest link. Cal takes this in.
CAL	Well, that's the meanest thing anyone's ever said to me.
JACOB	No, Cal. The meanest thing anyone's ever said to you is this: your wife cheated on you because you lost sight of what it took to keep her content at home -- as a man, as a husband, and probably as a lover. Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.
CAL	Yeah, okay, that was meaner.
CAL	I notice you only button your shirts up, like, halfway. I can't pull that off, right?
JACOB	No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be  calling women over to our table shortly. Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.
CAL	We should have some background on each other, no? I'm in insurance, more on the corporate side. My kids are --
JACOB	Cal, the only thing I care less about than corporate insurance are your kids. Here's the only thing  I need to know: how many women have you been with?
CAL	Sexually?
JACOB	Yes.
CAL	In my entire life?
JACOB	No, synchronized swimming. Yes,  Cal. Sexually.  Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on one hand.
CAL	One. Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.
JACOB	Wow, okay... wow. (then, checking)  Not at a time? Total?
CAL	What? I married young. We met in high school. He smiles, remembering.
CAL	Tracy was so damn beautiful. You know those women, the ones who can be wildly sexy and unbelievably cute all at once? I never knew how she did that. I still don't know how she does it. Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup our senior year but we made it --
JACOB	Cal, I literally stopped listening at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.
CAL	(a bit emotional) I miss my wife.
JACOB	Shut up, Cal. A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.
YOUNG WOMAN	Hi.
JACOB	Hi. Jacob Palmer.
YOUNG WOMAN	Amy Johnson. Cal extends his hand.
CAL
CAL --
JACOB	Don't. He pulls it back.
CAL	-- Weaver.
JACOB	Can I get you a drink, Amy?
JACOB	Tell me about yourself. What do you do?
NEW GIRL	Does it really matter?
JACOB	It does to me. She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats:
JACOB	It does to me. She smiles. PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.
NEWER GIRL	And that's when I started writing the column for LA Weekly. God,  how long have I been talking? Jacob takes her hand.
JACOB	Listen, I'm going to be honest: it's getting late and I think you're interesting. I also think you're one of those rare women who manages to be both wildly sexy and incredibly cute all at once.
ON CAL	Mouth agape. That was his line!
ON JACOB
JACOB	Let's get out of here. I know it's forward of me but just... I think we should get out of here. She thinks, then NODS.
NEWER GIRL	Okay.
JACOB	I think we should get out of here.
NEW GIRL	Okay.
JACOB	I think we should get out of here.
FIRST GIRL	Okay.
INTERCUT WITH:
ROBBIE	You want to talk about The Scarlet Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you go: the `A' they're both wearing -- I think it stands for ASSHOLE. Wanna know why? Because they're in love, and love is for stupid ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing this book, Mrs. Thompson, because this is what I need right now: to  read a boring, confusing book about a bunch of stupid assholes who fell in love, like assholes, and then had to die, like assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	You have a second?
TRACY	Oh, David. I'm just a little  swamped right now so...  He closes the door behind him.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	You've been avoiding me.
TRACY	No, I haven't.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	You ran away in the other  direction when you saw me coming  down the hall yesterday.
	You're very fast by the way.  She SIGHS, gives up.
TRACY	I ran track in high school.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	That must be it.  He turns serious.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	I'm sorry about you and Cal.
TRACY	Thank you.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	I'm also not sorry, if I'm being  completely honest.
	I want to make sure you know how  much I like you.
TRACY	No, I do --
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	A lot. Just to clarify. I like  you a lot. I had no intention of  falling for a married woman. I  just wanted someone to go to lunch  with who didn't make me want to  shoot myself in the face. But we  started having lunch, and talking,  and suddenly I was an accountant  who was popping out of bed in the  morning, excited to get to work.  That doesn't happen to  accountants. Ever. I've checked  with other accountants.  She smiles.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	So when the time is right for you  to get back out there again,  officially, I just... I'd like to  throw my hat in the ring.  Officially. That sounded weird.  Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward.
TRACY	David, you've been a great friend  to me. And you were the first man  in a very long time to make me  feel... noticed, I guess? What  happened between us that night...  it meant something to me. You  weren't the only one excited to  come to work lately.  David smiles.
TRACY	But now, when I see you, all I see  is his face. All I see when I  look at you is what I did to my  marriage.  She's losing it, wipes her eyes.
TRACY	You see this? I'm saving you from  disaster, David, `cause you're  asking to pre-board the Titanic.  Honestly, do you really want any  part of this?  Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.
TRACY
	Right, okay. No, I understand.  Of course, right away.  She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply:  "Yes." Tracy looks up, but David is gone.
TRACY	(calling back in) Yes, of course. Absolutely, Principal Sapienza, it won't happen again. She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.
TRACY	Seriously?
ROBBIE	Sorry. She SIGHS.
TRACY	It's been a rough couple of weeks, you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I have to get back to work. They walk out together.
TRACY	They still make kids read The Scarlet Letter, huh? Robbie NODS.
TRACY	You'd really think someone would have written something better by now. Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit.
TRACY	Guess I should take it down, huh?
ROBBIE	I guess.
TRACY	How is he? I've spoken to him but only about bills, or you kids, but... how is he, really? Robbie hesitates.
TRACY	Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me, I'm almost done here. She turns back to her work. After a beat:
ROBBIE	He's dressing a lot better. Going out a lot.
TRACY	Oh. Well, good. That's... really good. (then, covering) We'll get take-out for dinner tonight, okay? Think about what you're in the mood for. Robbie hesitates, then adds:
ROBBIE	He's sad. He looks better, but... sadder, too, I think. You know?
TRACY	Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad, too.
ROBBIE	I know.
TRACY	You do?
ROBBIE	I heard you crying the other night  and... I didn't know what to do.  I'm thirteen years old and... can  you just tell me what I'm supposed  to do in that situation? I didn't  want to Google it.  She smiles, shakes her head.
TRACY	Oh God, baby, you're so much like  me it's scary. You wound up with  all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so  sorry.
ROBBIE	I'm okay with being like you, Mom.  I like you.  She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.
TRACY	It's my fault, what happened with  your father. It's grown-up stuff  that I can't talk about but... it's my fault. Not his. So just... be good to him, okay?
ROBBIE	It'll be okay, Mom.
TRACY	You promise? He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever.
TRACY	David, this is my son, Robbie. Robbie, this is David. We work together. Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand.
TRACY	I'll be right back, okay, honey?
ROBBIE DAVID	Okay. Okay. Awkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something, thinks better of it, and EXITS. David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	So, Robbie... I hear you're quite the soccer player.
ROBBIE	So, David... I hear you broke up my parents' marriage. He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.
ROBBIE	You are David Jacobowitz, right? From accounting?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	Um, yes I am --
ROBBIE	Here's the thing, David: in the end, she winds up back with my dad. He's better than you, in every category except probably  math. And she still loves him.  Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	Listen, Robbie --
ROBBIE	Now I know what you're thinking: `he's just in 8th grade, what does he know about love?' I know a lot more than you think, David. Just today, I had a meltdown, almost gave up on the love of my life. My dad's having his meltdown now,  but long-term? He won't stop fighting for my mom any more than I won't stop sending Jessica texts that make her uncomfortable. And you need to know that. Tracy RE-ENTERS.
TRACY	You ready to go?
ROBBIE
	Mommy, can we do Chinese for  dinner tonight?
ON CAL	Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back  in order. As he takes it all in...  A LIGHT pops on.  Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.
JACOB	I think you're ready, Cal.
CAL	For what?
JACOB	To talk to a woman, take a woman home.
CAL	Oh, no. No, I'm not.
JACOB	You've been watching me do it for two weeks.
CAL	Yeah, well, I've been watching LeBron James for years, doesn't mean I can suddenly dunk a basketball.
JACOB	Cal, do you remember the part in Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps having the kid wax the car and the  kid gets all bent out of shape because he doesn't see the point, but the movements were actually  building blocks for throwing and blocking punches?
CAL	Oh God. Are you going to make me fight someone? Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:
JACOB	Cal, what's the first thing I do when a woman sits down?
CAL	You ask if you can buy her a drink.
JACOB	And what if she says no?
CAL	You order her a drink anyway, let it sit there.
JACOB	When she asks me a question about myself?
CAL	You deflect it back to her. You never answer questions about yourself.
JACOB	And what happens?
CAL	They talk about themselves. A lot.
JACOB	And what do I do?
CAL	You act really interested. You nod a lot.
JACOB	And at the end of the night?
CAL	You compliment them, then you ask if they'd like to come back to your place.
JACOB	Do I ask?
CAL	No. You confidently tell them you'd like them to come back to your place. Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me! Jacob BOWS to Cal, Japanese style. A PRETTY WOMAN stands near their table. Jacob stands, smiles.
JACOB	Oh, and no talking about your job,  your children, your pathetic sexual history, or David Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...
CAL	What, no, I'm not ready for -- (then, to woman) Hi! Jacob has pulled her over. She's attractive, mid-  thirties.
JACOB	Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal. Jacob NODS at Cal ("you've got this") and leaves them.  Kate SITS. Cal smiles at Kate, nervous. She smiles back. Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.
CAL	Can I buy you a drink, Kate?
CAL	I'm buying you a drink anyway, Kate, so you might as well tell me what you want.
KATE	Really, thank you but it's okay.
CAL	I'm guessing you're a vodka girl, am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty martini? No, no, no: a Grey Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon,  one drink! Picture those ice cubes clinking together. Mmmm. Can't you taste it? She smiles.
KATE	Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five years sober so... Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches.
WAITRESS	What can I get --
CAL	Nothing. We don't want anything. Don't come back here ever. The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around, uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.
KATE	So... what do you do, Cal?
CAL	What do you do, Kate?
KATE	I asked you first.
CAL	I asked you second. She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.
KATE	Seriously, what do you do?
CAL	Seriously, what do you do? Now it's getting a little weird.
KATE	I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what do you do? Cal NODS, exaggerated.
CAL	Teacher. Interesting. I'm very interested in teaching.
KATE	I'm sorry, are you not going to tell me what you do? He's still nodding, as if fascinated.
CAL	A teacher with an alcohol dependency no less, I bet that's actually more common than people realize...
KATE	I should get back to my friends --  Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.
CAL	I'm sorry! I'm supposed to deflect your questions... oh screw it: I'm in corporate insurance. And I have children. Plural. More than one. The only thing I have ONE of, is sexual partners, that would be the woman I recently separated from because she was cheating on me with David Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed to tell you about either.
KATE	What were you supposed to tell me?
CAL	I don't know: that you're a perfect combination of sexy and cute -- it was something I said about my wife that's since been corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm at least fifteen years older than you, and this sweater is called slim fitting but it's really just uncomfortable and itchy.
KATE	You think I'm a perfect combination of sexy and cute? Cal looks up.
CAL	That's what you took away from that? She smiles, sits back down.
KATE	Wow, an actual honest man. I don't know what to do with that. It's kind of... rare around here. It's nice, actually.
CAL	It is?
KATE	You have no idea. I'm kind of a magnet for these jerk-offs. They charm me, and I fall for it, and at some point they just... never call me again.
CAL	I don't understand. Look at you. Who wouldn't call you again? She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!
KATE	So... what were you `supposed' to do next?
CAL	Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to ask you if you want to get out of here. Actually no, I'm supposed to tell you, confidently, that you should come home with me.
KATE	Why don't you give it a shot, see what happens? Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then:
CAL	You're very pretty, Kate. And I can't tell if you're being serious, but I think you should come home with me.
KATE	Ask me again. Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident.
CAL	I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm telling you: you should come home with me. Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on. CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake.
CAL	(gasping for breath) This is my dumpy apartment that I had to move into when I left my wife.
KATE
	I love that you're being so honest. It's so different, so hot.
CAL	I've never been with a woman besides my ex-wife.
KATE	More, tell me more.
CAL	I'm worried you have AIDS. She stops.
CAL	Only a little. She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off. She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing.
KATE	What do you want to do with me?
CAL	Show you off to my wife to make her jealous. She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:
MEANWHILE --	1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2) JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him Notice You." 3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4) ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard. But we're mainly with CAL...
JACOB	... it would work!
CAL	You're out of your mind.
JACOB	What do college guys hate? Doing  laundry. What do they love?  Strippers. It's a strip club  where they can do their laundry.
CAL	It's ridiculous.
JACOB	And yours isn't? A candy store  that only sells red candy.
CAL	Everyone loves the cherry. Look,  I'm not rejecting the psuedo-  cherry flavors like raspberry or  strawberry, anything in the -erry  family is allowed. But let's be  real here: no one wants the  lemon. No one likes the grape.
JACOB	I like grape.
CAL	Well then you can't come to my  store.
CLAIRE	Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some good gossip at the nail salon.
BERNIE	For God's sake, Claire.
CLAIRE	It's about Cal.
BERNIE	Leave the poor bastard alone, would you? I gave him the cologne  like you told me to. We don't  have to dance on his grave.
CLAIRE	Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become quite a man-about-town if you get my drift.
JESSICA	What?
CLAIRE	Lots of young women coming in and  out of his apartment lately.
BERNIE	Claire, would you cut it out?
CLAIRE	It's good for Jess to know. She still baby-sits for him after all.
BERNIE	Oh, c'mon! Enough.
CLAIRE	Well, it's good gossip at the least. Ooh, guess what else I heard... As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON Jessica. Thinking.
JESSICA	Madison! Madison, wait! Madison stops walking, but not texting.
JESSICA	Hey, I had a question -- Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles.
MADISON	Hey, Jessica, whassup?
JESSICA	I had a question for you, Madison. It's kind of on the personal side so...
MADISON	My lips are... Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.
MADISON	Seals. My lips are seals.
JESSICA	Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the thing... I don't mean to be blunt or insulting but, let's call it what it is: you're always sleeping with older guys, right?
MADISON	Always.
JESSICA	Lots of college guys, I've heard.
MADISON	Lots of them.
JESSICA	Even rumors about a few teachers.
MADISON	Totally.
JESSICA	So my question is: how do you do that? I mean, how do you get them not to see you as... well, a kid in high school?
MADISON	Oh, well first off, I have a huge  rack.
JESSICA	You do, yes.
MADISON	So that helps.
JESSICA	Yes, I'm sure it does.
MADISON	You don't have a huge rack.
JESSICA	No, I don't unfortunately.
MADISON	So that's not gonna work.
JESSICA	Nope. Madison SIGHS.
MADISON	Okay, here's what you do. Wait, how old is he?
JESSICA	Old.
MADISON	Like really old?
JESSICA	Like parent old.
MADISON	Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.
JESSICA	Thank you, Madison.
MADISON	Alright, you have to hook him. Force his hand. Make him unable to stop himself from doing what he knows to be wrong.
JESSICA	How?
MADISON	Do what I do. Send him a postcard  from downtown.
JESSICA	Huh?
MADISON	Go TMZ on his ass.
JESSICA	I'm not following you, Madis--
MADISON	The full gyno.  Off Jessica's blank look.
MADISON	A crotch shot? A nip slip?
	A dirty picture! You can even  Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but  with nipple. Yeah, that's what  you should do: make it artistic.  Black and white. Make this face.  She makes a raw sexual face.
JESSICA	Jesus, Madison!
MADISON	Well, you came to me for advice, that's my advice. You put those across his radar, he won't see you as a little girl anymore, that's for sure. Madison walks off, calls back.
MADISON	Don't send it to him as a jpeg, though. He'll put it up on his fantasy football web-site. And  then your brother sees it, tells  your mom, and suddenly you're not  allowed to use Facebook for a  month. Thanks, Kevin!  She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice.
ROBBIE	There she is!
ON JESSICA	Oh shit.
ROBBIE	Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The Scarlet Letter: `No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.' Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.
ROBBIE	I am not bewildered! Jessica Riley is my soulmate. She's the  one! I know it to be true, and so  now do the multitude.
	Multitudes? (then, deciding) No, multitude.
JESSICA	Robbie, get down!
ROBBIE	I have marked myself with this Scarlet J, Jessica! For you. Because your name starts with a J. It's just tape and construction paper but one day I will get a permanent tattoo when I'm old enough that my parents won't freak out on me.
JESSICA	Robbie Weaver! I am your baby- sitter and I'm telling you to GET
JESSICA	What the hell are you thinking?
ROBBIE	You like the scaffold? It has wheels. Took four weeks to build it. Oh, those are my friends, they helped me wheel it down. Wave hello.
JESSICA	This has to stop, Robbie. Seriously.
ROBBIE	You'll learn to love me. I promise.
JESSICA	I won't.
ROBBIE	Just because I'm four years younger than you?
JESSICA	BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!!
JESSICA	I've been spending time with him for a while. Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
ROBBIE	No. You can't. I've checked. No boyfriend since ninth grade. No date for Spring Formal last
MONTH --
JESSICA	He's older. I don't want my parents to know. And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the cutest thing you've ever seen.
ROBBIE	Who is he?
JESSICA	It doesn't matter.
ROBBIE	Do I know him? Is he from town?
JESSICA	I don't know. Yes, kind of.
ROBBIE	I'll kill him if he hurts you. Jessica tries not to smile.
JESSICA	I know. But this all has to stop now, Robbie. The speeches, the texts, all of it. It's very sweet, but it has to stop. He just sits there, lost.
JESSICA	I'll see you around, okay? She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass. Devastated. His three friends approach.
ROBBIE'S FRIEND	We should probably get the scaffold back on the road before dark.
ROBBIE	Yeah.
CAL	Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been forever. Have you been getting out at all? I'll bring you some of that deli you like one night, okay? The kids? They're fine. (to other room) Kids, say hi to Nanna.
CAL	Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made  a new buddy, I've been spending time with him. Yeah, I'm going to  see her tomorrow night. Of course  I miss her. You don't know how much I miss...
ROBBIE	So you're seeing Mom tomorrow, huh? At my parent-teacher thing?
CAL	Yeah.
ROBBIE	First time in a while.
CAL	Yeah, but no biggie. Cal tosses him back the ball.
CAL	Hey, what's with the moping?
ROBBIE	Nothing. It's just... there's  this girl. Cal smiles.
CAL	Oh yeah? You like her?
ROBBIE	I like Pringles. This girl's my  soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid,  in love with her. And she wants  someone else.
CAL	But she's your soulmate?
ROBBIE	Yeah.
CAL	Well you can't just give up.
ROBBIE	Why not? (then, quietly) You did. Cal freezes.
ROBBIE	Mom was yours, right?
CAL	I didn't give up.
ROBBIE	Listen, Dad. I love you. I have your back, always. But let's be honest here: the woman told you she wanted a divorce and you jumped out of a car.
CAL	It was slightly more complicated than that. And I'm a different guy now.
ROBBIE	You're the same guy. You just have different clothes. Do you  still love her?
CAL	How old ARE you?
ROBBIE	Do you still love Mom? Cal doesn't say anything. His silence speaks volumes.
CAL	Weren't we talking about you?
ROBBIE	We are. Your son is in desperate need of some romantic inspiration. So set an example for your boy.  Don't give up. It's complicated? Uncomplicate it. She says no? Change her mind. Look at you, you're the man right now, Dad. Get her back. Get back my mom.
TRACY	You look great, Cal.
CAL	Oh, well turns out I've been buying the wrong size suit for twenty years so...
TRACY	Well you look great. Really. Cal smiles.
CAL	Thank you. You always look great, so... Awkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the  seat next to him.
CAL	I talked to Nanna yesterday.
TRACY	Me, too. She sound okay to you?
CAL	She sounded like... Nanna. She  worries about us.
CAL	I feel like I'm about to get detention. Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.
CAL	Which teacher is this?
TRACY	Mrs. Thompson. This is the one he pulled The Scarlet Letter Asshole routine on. Cal smiles.
CAL	He's a really weird kid, isn't he?
TRACY	Yeah. I kind of like him, though.
CAL	I do, too. I'm so glad we switched the babies at the hospital.
TRACY	Me, too. They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away. An awkward beat, then:
CAL	So, how are things with... (a beat, then) How's it going with David?  She looks down.
TRACY	Oh... it's not.
	It wasn't about him, if that means  anything.
CAL	No, I know.
TRACY	You seeing anyone?
CAL	Who, me? No. You know me. No, not really.
TRACY	Oh. Because you hear things, you know.
CAL	Yeah, well... Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes a breath, and turns toward Tracy.
CAL	I miss you, T. Tracy looks up surprised.
CAL	I got complacent, I think. You find your soulmate in high  school... you've got the game  sewed up in the first quarter, you know? She smiles.
CAL	I put in an effort when we were younger, didn't I? I'd do anything to make you happy: take you miniature golfing, dancing -- you were such a good dancer.
TRACY	I had to be. You were such a good miniature golfer. He smiles, emboldened.
CAL	All I ever wanted to do was make you love me. And then you did, really early on. And we got married so young. And I guess... I got lazy. I got boring. And I'm furious at you for what you did. But I don't totally blame you, if that makes any sense?
CAL	I shouldn't have jumped out of the car. I should have fought for you. You fight for your soulmate. At least that's what our thirteen- year-old tells me. Tracy's eyes well up with tears.
TRACY	He's a very strange boy, isn't he?
CAL	I'll be honest: he scares the shit out of me. She LAUGHS through her tears.
TRACY	I missed you, too. Cal takes her hand, kisses it.
AT DOORWAY	It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson... better known to us as: KATE (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with). Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.
CAL	Oh God.
KATE	Cal? What are you doing here?
CAL	(looking to the sky) Really?
TRACY	You two know each other?
CAL	Um, yes... we've met before.
KATE	We've met before? Seriously?
CAL	Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife. Tracy.
KATE	Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?
CAL	Why don't we head inside?
KATE	YES, WHY DON'T WE!?
TRACY	I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up: how do you two know each other?
KATE	Maybe your husband should tell you. Cal hesitates.
CAL	We have a mutual friend.
KATE	Ha!
CAL	You know, maybe we should focus on Robbie?
KATE	Yes, let's do that. Let's focus on Robbie. Kate goes to her blackboard.
KATE	As you know, Robbie's shining moment this year was when he set a school record for cursing in an eighth grade English class. She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it.
KATE	Asshole. Are you familiar with this word, Mrs. Weaver?
CAL	She's heard it, yes. So in terms of Robbie's progress --
KATE	Asshole: as in, someone who tells a woman that he'll call, and never does.
CAL	We were a little concerned about Robbie's grade on his oral book
REPORT --
KATE	Asshole: as in, someone who uses `honesty' to get a woman into bed with him, but is actually full of shit like the rest of them.
CAL	Because usually he's a very strong public speaker --
KATE	Asshole: as in, someone who allows a woman to go down on him for forty-five minutes because he's `nervous' --
CAL	OKAY! ENOUGH!!!
CAL	I can explain. Tracy rushes out of the room. Cal calls after her.
CAL	She's an alcoholic! You can't trust what she says!
CAL	Tracy, wait!
TRACY	Leave me alone, Cal!
KATE	I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you
ON SPECTATORS	TEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents), stepping out into the hallway and following them outside.
CAL	Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.
TRACY	(fumbling for keys) I know, and I cheated, so it doesn't make any sense for me to be mad at you.
CAL	Okay, so --
TRACY	I can't do this now, Cal.
CAL	Tracy, I love you.
KATE	Tell her she's the perfect combination of sexy and cute,
CAL	It's a funny story, actually --
TRACY	I'm going home. She opens the car door.
CAL	Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with her! I slept with our son's eighth grade teacher! GASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a picture with her cell phone.
CAL	But all it did was confirm what I already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
CAL	Before, you were the only woman I'd ever been with or wanted to be with. And now, even after I've been with eleven women, you're
CAL	... the only woman I want to be with.
TRACY	I don't even know who you are. Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.
CAL	(weakly, to himself) I'm your soulmate. Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met...  By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF.
CAL	HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK
CAL	REALLY!!!???
RICHARD	Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!? The room goes quiet.
RICHARD	Now, if we could get our guest of honor over here... I forget what she looks like, anyone remember?  POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink, and walks over to Richard. Is this it?
RICHARD	I'm so proud of you, baby. I had my doubts, of course... More CHEESY LAUGHTER.
RICHARD	Now I did tell you that it'd be a special night when you passed the bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know I never lie... More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders another drink, barely able to take it.
RICHARD	So, Hannah, I'd like to formally ask you, in front of all our friends and colleagues...
RICHARD	... if you'd like to become a permanent lawyer at the firm of Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!? CHEERS. Hannah steps back, breathless. Richard reacts.
RICHARD	You don't have a better offer already, do you? Everyone LAUGHS.
HANNAH	No, that's great. I just... (then, privately) I'm sorry, I thought... I thought you were about to propose. The room goes quiet, trying to hear.
RICHARD	What?
HANNAH	No, I just... it's fine. I'm sorry, I just got thrown is all. Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
RICHARD	Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.
HANNAH	No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
RICHARD	It's definitely a possibility, down the road. I think I just need a little more time. I'm still figuring out how I feel about us, you know: long-term.
HANNAH	No, I know... Wait -- you're figuring out how you feel about us? She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.
RICHARD	Honey? She's really laughing now.
HANNAH	You know what the best part is: I would have said yes! To YOU! And I didn't even want you to propose! Just now, I swear to God: I was hoping you wouldn't propose. And I still would have said YES! That's how pathetic I am! She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT. She grabs Richard's cheeks.
HANNAH	I will consider your job offer, thank you so much, Richard. Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes, Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.
WOMAN	And you know what she said?
ON JACOB	Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest smile. They melt. We've seen this before. SLAM! The door to the bar busts open, revealing:
HANNAH	Do you remember me?
JACOB	Yes.
HANNAH	Do you still think I'm attractive?
JACOB	Yes.
HANNAH	Do you still want to take me home?
JACOB	Yes. Hannah NODS, takes his hand.
HANNAH	Let's go. She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN Jacob had just been introducing himself to.
WOMAN #1	Slut.
HANNAH	This place looks like something out of a men's magazine.
JACOB	Is that a compliment?
HANNAH	I'm not sure. Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.
HANNAH	I like this song.
JACOB	I thought you would. Drink?
HANNAH	Yes, please. Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings them (and the bottle) over towards the couch. He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.
JACOB	Cheers.
HANNAH	Cheers. They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She  holds out her glass for a refill. Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes choking...
HANNAH	So is this how it normally works?
JACOB	What?
HANNAH	How you woo a woman? You take them back to your granite- countered bachelor pad, put on the perfect song, and make them a drink?
JACOB	Yes. That's how it normally works. Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.
HANNAH	And then you sleep with them?
JACOB	Yes.
HANNAH	So that's what happens next? We sleep together?
JACOB	At some point, yes, I was under the impression that was your plan. She takes a deep breath, admits:
HANNAH	I'm very nervous.
JACOB	I'm getting that.
HANNAH	I know at the bar I seemed confident, but I was more just soaking wet and cold and trying to be dramatic. Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.
JACOB	You're adorable. Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
HANNAH	No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated sexy! Because I know what happens next in the PG-13 version of tonight: I get really drunk, and I pass out, and you cover me with a blanket, and kiss my forehead, and nothing happens... but that's not why I'm here! I'm here to bang the hot guy from the bar who hit on me.
JACOB	I don't think people say `bang' anymore.
HANNAH	I do. We're going to bang. I'm finally going to do something exciting and dangerous and Liz can blow me! Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
HANNAH	Okay, okay, this is happening. Take off your shirt.
JACOB	What?
HANNAH	I need to stop thinking. Take off your shirt. Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it off. He's ripped.
HANNAH	Holy crap. She pokes a finger at his abs.
HANNAH	It's like you're photo-shopped.
JACOB	Now take off yours.
HANNAH	No way! Not with all that happening... She motions casually at his abs.
HANNAH	So... do you prefer to do it here or in the bedroom?
JACOB	In the bedroom is preferable. Hannah stands, a girl on a mission.
HANNAH	Good. Let's go there.
HANNAH	This pillow is amazing. It forms perfectly to the shape of my head.
JACOB	I'm glad you like it. They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.
HANNAH	Wait, are these those foam pillows from Brookstone? Off his look...
HANNAH	They are, aren't they!? I always wondered who actually buys them! You do! The hot guy from the bar buys them! Of course! She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
HANNAH	Sorry, let's proceed. Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.
HANNAH	You don't have one of those ridiculous massage chairs, do you?
JACOB	No.
HANNAH	Oh. My. God! You totally do!
JACOB	I do. She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious.
HANNAH	How much did it cost?
JACOB	Five thousand doll--  That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is different for him. He likes her. We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it. We watch him look at Hannah.
ON HANNAH	Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing. And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:
JACOB	Do me a favor. Ask me a question about myself.
HANNAH	What? No! I don't want to know anything about you.
JACOB	C'mon, one question.
HANNAH	Okay, fine, but then we bang.
JACOB	Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll answer anything. You can ask me about my job, or past
GIRLFRIENDS --
HANNAH	What's your mom like?
JACOB	Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but cold. Very cold.
HANNAH	And your father?
JACOB	He died, long time ago. Left us a lot of money, which is how I have... He motions at his PILLOW.
JACOB	Stuff like this. She motions at his abs.
HANNAH	And time for stuff like that? He LAUGHS.
JACOB	My dad was the opposite of my mom, actually... We PULL BACK as they continue chatting. TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then another. Body language shifts. -- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on their sides, face-to-face, talking some more. -- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on the forehead, and begins falling in love with him. CUE MUSIC as we begin a...
JACOB	staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks  terrified.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I  was wondering if --
TRACY	David, stop. Look, I had a nice  time, which is a substantial  upgrade from the rest of the...  times I've been having lately.  So, I don't think I'm ready to  start dating but my ex clearly is  and there's a yogurt shop where  they make this eight calorie ice  cream that tastes like a laxative,  so if you'd like to take me there  sometime I guess I wouldn't say  no.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	Wow. You know, that's exactly  what I was thinking. It's almost  uncanny.  They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry.  Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then...  THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.
JESSICA	Hello.
TRACY	Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry.  Jessica, this is my work-friend.
TRACY	He's an accountant named David.  David, this is my baby-sitter,  Jessica. Okay, David, well  everything sounds great.  Spreadsheets.  David smiles knowingly.
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	I'll see you at work.  He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward.
JESSICA	So... How was dinner?
TRACY	It was just for work.
JESSICA
	It's a pretty dress.
TRACY	Oh, thanks.  Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.
TRACY	So how much do I owe yo--
JESSICA	Did you know your kids are the  only ones I baby-sit for who  always want to stay awake so they  can see their dad when he gets  home. I mean, they fight with  everything they have to keep their  eyes open so they can hear what  Dad had for dinner, or how he  liked the movie. Lot of kids want  to stay awake for Mom -- and your  kids always want to see you, don't  get me wrong -- but not a lot wait  up for Dad. Maybe it's because  he's good, and he's kind, and he's  decent.
TRACY	What are you talking abo--
JESSICA	Batshit crazy.  She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.
TRACY	Jessica?  Jessica turns, explodes?
JESSICA	I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY!
TRACY	Jessica!  But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that")  and CLOSES the door.
ON ROBBIE	at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers.
ENVELOPE READING:	"Cal Weaver." With a heart. She stares at the envelope  for a beat.  Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS.  Jessica jumps, started. She quickly puts the envelope in  a drawer and heads for the door.
CAL	Hello?
TRACY	Hi, Cal.  Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea.
TRACY	So... I'm in the basement. I'm  trying to get the water heater  working `cause the pilot's out and  I don't know how to relight it.  Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.
TRACY	I'm sorry to bother you, I just...  what do I do?  Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then:
CAL	It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad  you called. Here: I'll walk you  through it.
	Do you see the little grey door?
TRACY	Yeah.
CAL	Pull it down.  She pantomimes this in the kitchen.
TRACY	Okay, it's down.
CAL	Now, you see the red button? I  wrote `push' on it?
TRACY	I got it.
CAL	Push. Now turn that to the right  and stick the match in.
TRACY	Oh, there it goes!
CAL	Good. Now just close the door and  you're good to go.  Silence. The charade is over. Now what?
TRACY	Well, thanks, Cal. I...  appreciate your help.
CAL	No, anytime. Call anytime with  stuff like that.
	Talk to you later?
TRACY	Yeah. And... thanks again.  Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife  as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him.
CAL	Nanna's coming over tonight. You guys haven't seen her in a while. Wanna stay for dinner?
ROBBIE	Sure.
CAL	Your mom's working till five,  we'll have to tell her. (off their silence)  What do you guys want to do today?
MOLLY	(not looking up) High School Musical.
CAL	Well, there's a shocker. She goes back into her trance.
ROBBIE	She still won't talk to you?
CAL	Not if that show's on.
ROBBIE	No, I mean, Mom.
CAL	Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes when we pass you guys off.
ROBBIE	What happened?
CAL	Beyond your pay-grade, buddy. Cal looks pained.
CAL	I will say this though: I got close. We were laughing. Talking about old times, all the things we used to do... His eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE  from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on.
CAL
	Hey. Get your coat. Robbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in hand.
CAL	Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off the show.
MOLLY	No!
CAL	I have to --
MOLLY	NOOOO!
CAL	I'm turning it off --
MOLLY	NOOOOOOOOOOO!
MOLLY	(free at last) Thank you. Cal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch.
BERNIE	Oh, hey, Cal.
CAL	Bernie.
BERNIE	So how've you --
CAL	Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but  I'm doing something at the old  house tonight and I'm in a bit of  a rush so... yeah. Thanks again  for the cologne.  Cal takes off.
CAL	Hello?
JACOB	Hey, Cal.
CAL	Oh. My. God. It's alive.
JACOB	I'm sorry. I know I've been out  of circulation.
CAL	You abandoned me at my time of  need.
JACOB	I've been a little... things have  gotten a bit... I met a woman.
CAL	I bet you did.
JACOB	No, I mean, I've been spending a lot of time with her. This woman. One woman.
CAL	Okay, whatever.
JACOB	Actually, tonight... I'm going to  meet her mother.
CAL	Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do realize you might actually have to answer a question or two about yourself?
JACOB	Yes, I realize that, asshole. Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car. Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her.
JACOB	Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?
CAL	You've got my number. Hey. Good for you, by the way.
JACOB	Thanks.  Cal HANGS up, LAUGHS to himself, and gets back to work.
JESSICA	No!!!! She jumps, but it's too late.
ON BERNIE	Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the point: it's a father's worst nightmare. Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the envelope. He looks at the envelope again.
ON ENVELOPE	Cal's name. A heart.
JESSICA	Daddy? Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.
ON JESSICA	Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys.
TRACY	Baby! What are you wearing!?
ROBBIE	Dad's here.  Tracy's face drops.
ROBBIE	I have to blindfold you.
TRACY	What is this? What is he doing?
ROBBIE	Relax, Mom. He's your husband, not Al Queda. You'll make it out alive. She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind. He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER!
ROBBIE	Okay, we're good, let's do this.
CAL	Hi, T.
TRACY	Can I take these off, please?
CAL	Almost. Kids?
CAL
	Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver  saw Tracy Boyle for the first  time, walking the halls of  Woodside Middle School --
TRACY	Cal: are you seriously doing this  in front of the kids?
ROBBIE
	If it goes bad I'm supposed to  take Molly upstairs and put the TV  on loud.  Tracy SIGHS, giving up.
TRACY	Well, might as well wait for your  daughter.
CAL	She's right next to you, T.
TRACY	No, your other daughter.  Huh? Just then:
CAL	Nanna!
HANNAH	Hi, Daddy. WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of  wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.
JACOB	Cal?
CAL	What the hell are you doing here?
JACOB	What the hell are you doing here?
HANNAH	Wait, you two know each other?
TRACY	Hi, Nanna.
CAL	Wait, what's going on?
ROBBIE	Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH	Hey, Robbie.
MOLLY	Hey, Nanna.
HANNAH	Hey, cutie.
JACOB	WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?
HANNAH	It's me, I couldn't pronounce Hannah when I was little -- wait, so how do you know my dad?
JACOB	Oh, God.
CAL	I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING
HANNAH	Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.
CAL	No. No. No. No.
TRACY	I want to see the boyfriend!
(STRUGGLING WITH
SCARVES)	Can someone please take this off?
JACOB	HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR-
CAL	I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR
JACOB	WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?
CAL	YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY
HANNAH	So you two, like, really know each other?
CAL	No way -- you and her... no way. End it, now.
HANNAH	Daddy!!!
JACOB	Well, that's not going to happen.
CAL	Well, then I'm going to murder you.
HANNAH	DAD!
TRACY	(down to two scarves) Will someone please take this goddamn thing off me!
CAL	Robbie, take the goddamn thing off your mother! (then, looking up)  Bernie?
JESSICA	Daddy, no!
ROBBIE	Is that Jessica? BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw.
HANNAH	Daddy!
JESSICA	Daddy!
TRACY
(YANKING ON
BLINDFOLD)	What's happening? Bernie is pummeling Cal.
BERNIE	I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU
HANNAH	Jacob!
CAL	Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
JESSICA	Daddy, stop! This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates.
JESSICA	He didn't do anything. He doesn't even know.
ROBBIE	Know what?
CAL	Know what?
TRACY	Robbie, please get this off me!
ROBBIE	(struggling with it) I'm TRYING!
JESSICA	He doesn't even know that I'm in love with him! Robbie stops, turns.
ROBBIE	With who?
JESSICA	(pointing at Cal) With him.
CAL	Are you pointing at me?
ROBBIE	Are you pointing at him?
TRACY	Who is she pointing at!?
ROBBIE	Wait: my dad is the older guy you've been seeing?
BERNIE	I knew it. He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him.
JESSICA	He doesn't even know about the dirty pictures I made for him.
ROBBIE	You made him dirty pictures? Oh God.
ROBBIE
	You're the one? You're the one  she...  (then, furious)  You stole my soulmate.
CAL	Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	You left your sweater in my car  the other night.
HANNAH	Who are you?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	David Jacobowitz.
JACOB	David Jacobowitz!
CAL	David Jacobowitz!?
DAVID JACOBOWITZ	Is this a bad time --  WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right  hook.
HANNAH	Jacob!
JACOB	You know how much misery you've put this poor bastard through!? Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob.
CAL	Stay the hell away from my daughter.
POLICE OFFICER #1	Well, okay. That should about do it. (to his partner)  What do you think?  The other cop SHRUGS. The first cop, thinks, then:
POLICE OFFICER #1	Look, I'm just gonna write domestic disturbance reported but all clear, okay? `Cause honestly, I don't even know what to put down here.
TRACY	Thank you, Officer.  He nods, walks to the door. Stops there.
POLICE OFFICER #1	Just... simmer down, okay? We all have arguments, but if you're gonna fight -- just do it inside.  Keep it in the family, okay? Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him.
CAL	I'll kill you. The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.
BERNIE	Let's go. Now.  She NODS. Looks back at Cal.
JESSICA	I'm so sorry --
BERNIE	NOW!
CAL	Don't.
JACOB
CAL --	Cal turns to Hannah.
CAL	This man is a lowlife and a
WOMANIZER --
TRACY	(under her breath)  Oh, that's ironic.  Cal whips around.
CAL	I'm sorry, what?  Tracy doesn't push it. Cal turns back to Hannah.
CAL	You may not be able to see it, but  I have. Over and over again. You are not to see him any more.
HANNAH	Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop seeing him. Cal turns away.
CAL	Well then I don't have anything  else to say to you.
HANNAH
DAD --
CAL	GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!
ON HANNAH	shocked.
TRACY	Cal, stop being unreasona--
CAL	I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY
TRACY	IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL!
CAL	AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT
JACOB	(one last try) Cal, c'mon -- But Cal won't even look at him.
MOLLY	Goodbye, Nanna.
HANNAH	Goodbye, cutie. They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.
CAL	She's all yours, David.  Ouch.
TRACY	Nice.  Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie.
CAL	Go big or go home, right, buddy?  Robbie looks up at him, cold.
ROBBIE	Go home, Dad.  Cal NODS, EXITS.
WAITRESS	Can I get you another?
CAL	What time is it?
WAITRESS	2:30. In the afternoon.
CAL	2:30 would have been sufficient but I appreciate the judgment, Cocktail Waitress. Yes, another drink would be grand. She EXITS. Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches:
CAL	That was uncalled for. Sorry for being a dick.
ON JACOB	Standing there. As always, he looks perfectly put together. He takes in Cal.
JACOB	It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.
CAL	What do you want?
JACOB	Can I sit?
CAL	I don't know, can you?
JACOB	Okay, are we going to be mature about this, or act like children?
CAL
	`Are we going to be mature or act like children?'
JACOB	Okay, so like children then. Move over. Jacob SLIDES in.
JACOB	I'd like to talk.
CAL	You still seeing my daughter?
JACOB	Yes.
CAL	Then I have nothing to say to you.
JACOB	Cal. Cal, look at me. Cal looks. Jacob still has that power over him.
JACOB	You been hanging out here a lot?
CAL	Sometimes.
JACOB	Must be missing a lot of work.
CAL	I have a lot of vacation days.
JACOB	Some vacation.
CAL	I hate the beach... you've got a  lot of nerve coming here -- Just then, the WAITRESS re-approaches. Delivers Cal's drink. They wait her out. She EXITS.
JACOB	You want a sip?
CAL	No, she probably spit in it. Jacob NODS as Cal pushes the drink away.
JACOB	Your kids miss you.
CAL	You're hanging out with my kids, fantastic! You can teach Robbie how to objectify women, he'll love that.
JACOB	His eighth grade graduation is  next week. You coming?
CAL	Of course I'm coming.
JACOB	Well you haven't exactly been around for him, Cal.
CAL	He's not my biggest fan right now.
JACOB	Oh, that's a good excuse --
CAL	Alright, man-whore, if your lecture on parental responsibility is almost done --
JACOB	I love her, Cal.  Cal looks up.
JACOB	I've never been in love before.  Honestly, I've never even been in  `like' before.
	I never got it. I saw people in  love -- I saw weakness. I heard them say the things they said, and do the things they do, it all just seemed so... so pathetic.
JACOB	She's my perfect combination of everything, Cal. Cal looks up at Jacob. He smiles, gently.
CAL	I know you. I know what you are.  You are not good enough for my  daughter. And you will never have  my permission nor my approval.  Jacob stands.
JACOB	I'll see you at graduation.  He EXITS. Once more, Cal is alone. Just as he wants it.
ON STAGE	We WATCH the ceremony for a moment. The PRINCIPAL labors  through her introduction...
KATE	Our next speaker is not only the class salutatorian, but he's also one of the most... Spirited... young men, I've ever had the pleasure of teaching. Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie Weaver. Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same  kid we've come to love. There's something different in  his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA.
ROBBIE	(a bit monotone)  Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.  Welcome, Class of 2011.
	I wasn't really sure what I wanted  to talk about today. Mrs.  Thompson said it might be good to  talk about growing up and getting  older and stuff. So I guess I'll  talk about that.  Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son?
ROBBIE	I grew up a lot this year, I  think. I used to think that  growing up meant really growing.  Like getting taller and bigger.  But now I think that growing up  just makes you smaller. Your  dreams get smaller, and what you  want gets smaller...  (beat, then)  I grew an inch and a half this  year, but I feel a lot smaller.  Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.
ROBBIE	I was in love. And I know that  makes parents laugh because I'm  only thirteen but whatever, I was.
ROBBIE	I believed that there was one true  love for everyone, and if you  fought for that person, your one  true love would always work out.  But that's not how it works. It  sounded good when I was younger,  but... it's just not how it works.  There's no such thing as one true  love for everyo--
ROBBIE	Dad?
CAL	Hi.  (awkward, to crowd)  Hi, everyone.  Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly  really uncomfortable.
CAL	May I have a word with my son?  It'll just take a second.  Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps  over people, squeezes by people, almost trips.  Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his  dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.  Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.
ROBBIE
	What are you doing?
CAL	I don't know. What are you doing?  Robbie's eyes well up with tears.
ROBBIE	I was wrong, Dad. There's no such  thing as --  Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:
CAL	My son's graduation speech sucks.  GASPS from the crowd.
ON CAL	Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an  entire eighth grade graduation ceremony.  He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS.  THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.
CAL	In fairness, I don't know where he  was going but I think we can all  agree it was heading in a pretty  depressing direction. And I  basically wrote it for him. I  mean, I didn't literally write it  but I sure as hell influenced it,  and the kid's already a spitting  image of his mother and I'll be  damned if this is what he's going  to get from me.  People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck.
CAL	My son -- not him, my actual son --  he believes in grand romantic  gestures. He believes that people  have soulmates. And we always  want to tell our thirteen-year-  olds that they're wrong, that `one  day you'll understand, young man.'  But maybe it should be the other  way around.  He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.
CAL	I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. Our first  date, we went for ice cream.  After, my dad started teasing me  about my `first date' the way dads  do. And I told him: `stop making  a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go  on lots of dates with plenty of  girls.' That was the first time I  ever lied to my father.

CAL	I met my soulmate when I was  fifteen years old. And I have  loved her with everything I have  for every minute, of every day,  ever since she let me buy her that  first mint chip ice cream. I have  loved her through the birth of our  three perfect children, and I have  loved her even as I've hated her --  only married couples can truly  understand that one. And I don't  know what will wind up happening  with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm  sorry I can't give you that -- but  I promise you this: I will never  stop trying. When you find `the  one' you never give up trying...  and I love you, my amazing boy,  for reminding me of that.  Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses  his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.  Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:
ROBBIE	I still love you, Jessica! I've  loved you since the first time you  changed my sister's diaper! I've  loved you since...  The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie  continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back.
CAL	Hi, Nanna.
HANNAH	Daddy.  He smiles at her, adoring.
CAL	My perfect girl.  He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.
CAL	I already ordered a gun. I'm not  kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on  a shady internet site, I can show  you the receipt. If you hurt her,  I am prepared to shoot you in the  face.
JACOB	Cal, I'm not going to --
CAL	Shut up, Jacob.  Jacob shuts up.
CAL	Wow. I like that.  Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:
CAL	Is that a new shirt?
JACOB	Hannah took me to the Gap. It's  actually not as bad as I thought.
CAL	Seriously?
JACOB	Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.  I got this at Nordstrom's.  And like that... order is restored in the universe.
ROBBIE	It was nice of you to come.
JESSICA	I wouldn't have missed it. Awkward.
ROBBIE	So, how are things with your dad?
JESSICA	Strained. I took a summer internship up at Stanford, gonna  head up there early. Figure it can't hurt to get out of his line of sight for a while.
ROBBIE	Yeah, probably a good idea. You were a good baby-sitter, Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable. He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
JESSICA	Wait: I thought you weren't  giving up.
ROBBIE	I'm not. But I figure: you like  my dad, and one day I'll look like my dad, so I'll just come for you then. Jessica smiles.
JESSICA	It's a good plan. She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.
JESSICA	Until then: a little graduation gift. To help get you through high school. She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of envelope she once used for... Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses him, sweetly, on the cheek.
JESSICA	You take care, Robbie. Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps  up next to his son.
CAL	You okay, buddy?
ROBBIE
	I am now, Dad. I am now.  Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles.
CAL	We might have to lock him up.  Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.
TRACY	You gave a good eighth grade  graduation speech.
CAL	I've been working on it for thirty  years, so...  She LAUGHS, then... quiet.
TRACY	Do you think we can ever come back  from all this, Cal?
CAL	I don't know. I'd like to try  though. I know I'd like to try.  She nods, thinking.
TRACY	Things are just so messed up. And  it's been such a strange year.  I've been in such a strange place.  And we have all these problems, so  many problems I've lost count, but  at the end of the day, I mean, the  only thing I know --  She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:
TRACY	I am just so glad you took me for  that ice cream.  Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:
TRACY	It was rocky road by the way.
CAL	No!  As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream  was, we PULL BACK.  Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and  watches them enjoy one another's company.  He smiles.
