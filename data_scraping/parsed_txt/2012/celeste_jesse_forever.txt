Celeste & Jesse Forever

JESSE	I'm a Love Rhino...
CELESTE JESSE	Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've got a enough love for got enough love, for the two the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please... oh shit, I gotta take this. Turn it down.
CELESTE	Jess, turn it down, seriously! She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.
JESSE	Maybe. I may have an important call coming in too, so... They both know he has no important call coming in.
CELESTE	(on the phone) Okay. Ready? This year all trends point towards simplicity and comfort. Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of them.
JESSE	What the shit??
CELESTE	(she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone call.(back to her call) That's enough of a blurb, right?
JESSE	Does this tooth look dark?
CELESTE	Okay. Call me back if they need more.
JESSE	Like a little darker than the rest?
CELESTE	Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't you just sit still for two minutes? And we talked about this, no more smoking!
JESSE	I wasn't smoking, I just found it.
CELESTE	Come on. They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street lamps. Celeste sneers.
JESSE	I think it's beautiful. A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.
CELESTE	What are you doing? Why are you stopping?
JESSE	Well, your appointment is not until noon and this is that place with the deadstock vintage Italian fabric. I thought it would be good for the guest room windows. Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.
CELESTE	Oh wow...you are so thoughtful. Jesse smiles, proud of himself.
JESSE	Whassup, muthafucka?? Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at fabric.
CELESTE	Jess, that place is insane. They have tassels that were manufactured for Mussolini's mistress...
JESSE	(covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on the phone. It's important.
CELESTE	Okay then.
JESSE	Really? I just...don't know what to say. Thank you so much for calling me.
CELESTE	(whispers) Did you get the job??
JESSE	Well, sometimes things are just meant to work out.
CELESTE	Was that the job? Did you get the book job?
JESSE	No, but Celeste...
CELESTE	What the fuck are you talking about?

JESSE
CELESTE	Yeah. Take me home, it's fine.
CELESTE	Be back by six so you can shower.
JESSE	Why shower?
CELESTE	Dinner with Beth and Tucker.
JESSE	Right, right.
CELESTE	Have fun shredding your glassy peel.
JESSE	Aw, so wrong.
CELESTE	Love you.
JESSE	Love you too. He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature "C and J" hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.
TUCKER	Did you end up going to see that band at Spaceland last week?
JESSE	Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. They are real. You know what? They should be your wedding band.
JESSE	They're loud but they're affordable.
CELESTE	They opened for Darcy Fudged His Knickers. Now, they're amazing. You'd be lucky to book them for your wedding. Or you should see if Emergency Breakthrough is available. The horn section is tight.
BETH	It's already done. We got the best swing band in New England. Sugarfoot and The Swingin' Scrod.
TUCKER	I told you, I'm not doing it. Swing is so late 90's, honey.
BETH	I love you. We'll talk about this later.
CELESTE	So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet zalad and zeh bolognese, riiiiiiight?
JESSE	Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring.
CELESTE	I don't vant dessert. I vill joost have bite oof yorrrs.
JESSE	Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh we doooooo!
CELESTE	Yawh!!!!
BETH	I can't do this. I just can't.
CELESTE	Are you okay? Oh no...
BETH	It's just not right. I can't hold my tongue. We can't do this anymore.
CELESTE	Honey, weddings are stressful, I know all about it. But you guys we'll be fine!
BETH	NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are YOU TWO doing??
CELESTE	What do you mean?
JESSE	Yeah, what do you mean?
BETH	What do I mean?? You guys are not together anymore! This is not normal! You've been separated for SIX MONTHS and you hang out every day like nothing's wrong! It's fucking weird!
TUCKER	Beth...
BETH	No, Tucker, you think it's weird too. Speak up for yourself.
TUCKER	It's weird. Let's not play charades anymore.
CELESTE	No charades. We are separated and we're friends. You guys should be happy, all we did was fight before.
JESSE	Yeah, you guys should be thrilled about this. You'll never have to pick sides.
CELESTE	Yeah, everyone's cool.
BETH	Everyone is not cool! This is not cool! It's just not working for me, I'm sorry. Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and stare at Tucker in silence.
JESSE	Bett iz zo angry.
CELESTE	Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.
TUCKER	Yeah, you guys are weird. I can't do this. It's fucked up. Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave and sip their wine quietly.
JESSE	C, look...uhhhh! Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.
CELESTE	Ahhhhh! Oh god! They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the thousandth time they've done this stupid joke, it will always be funny. To them.
JESSE	Crazy.
CELESTE	It's not weird that we hang out. Do you think it's weird we hang out?
JESSE	No, of course not. You're my best friend.
CELESTE	Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not hang out. The last time we didn't talk for longer than a week was in 10th grade when you went to Space Camp Canada.
JESSE	Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. I mean, the anti-gravity training was insane but I missed you.
CELESTE	Well, I'm exhausted.
JESSE	Me too. Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he is living in her guest house.
CELESTE	Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight, how's the heat in there?
JESSE	Oh, it's fine. I'm fine. He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.
CELESTE	Jesse, please, you can stay here as long as you like. It's your studio. It's actually really nice to have you here.
JESSE	For me too.
CELESTE	Oh, don't forget, the contractor needs to get in there for measurements in the morning. So make sure your thingys, your sculptures, whatever...are out of the way.
JESSE	Got it.
CELESTE	Night.
JESSE	Night. Love you.
CELESTE	Love you too.
BUSINESS MAN	Large coffee, please.
CELESTE	Excuse me, sir?
BUSINESS MAN	Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.
CELESTE	Did you not?
BUSINESS MAN	I'm in a rush.
CELESTE	So you did know. And everyone's in a rush, so...
BUSINESS MAN	Well, she was looking at the pastries, I didn't think she was ready to order.
CELESTE	Well, it's not just her. It's everyone behind her too. So, if you want to ask all these people if it's okay to cut in front of them because you are late, be my guest. Just don't assume that your time is more important than everyone else's.
BUSINESS MAN	Have a nice day.
CELESTE	(sotto) Prick.
CELESTE	American culture is dying. We have an unrelenting appetite for processed junk food, talentless pop stars like Riley Banks and recycled movie franchises like Transformers. The more we consume crap, the more we want crap.
RACHEL MADDOW	Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there an upshot?
CELESTE	I think there will be a groundswell movement towards simplicity. People will start to listen to their most rudimentary needs-- they will crave mental, spiritual and physical nourishment. It's back to basics.
RACHEL MADDOW	Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks for being with us today. You're great, come back any time. For more on this gloomy but interesting subject, look out for trend forecaster, Celeste Martin's new book "Shitegeist," on bookshelves Monday.
CELESTE	Thanks so much, Rachel.
CELESTE	So I had dinner with the drama club last night.
SCOTT	Who's that?
CELESTE	Tucker and Beth. They're such dicks. They left in protest because they think Jesse and I are being "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're fine.
SCOTT	You're only done when you're done.
CELESTE	Spare me the spiritual platitudes, Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions to Scott) no one would even question us being friends!
SCOTT	You and Jesse are clearly not ready to let each other go. And there's nothing wrong with that.
CELESTE	Yeah there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, what do you think?
SCOTT	Well, to be honest... Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.
CELESTE	Wait, we're signing Riley Banks?? When were you going to tell me?? I just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. Great.
SCOTT	Yeah, that's why I wanted you to come in. It's a huge account..
CELESTE	Scott, you and I built this company so we wouldn't have to take an account like Riley Banks.
SCOTT	Well, you and I may not have a company if we don't take Riley Banks. Recession, remember?
CELESTE	She's like a...soul-less hologram.
SCOTT	She is releasing a new album. She wants us to do the branding and merchandising. We need to take this account.
CELESTE	Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.
SCOTT	If you are looking for my opinion, I do think you should start dating.
CELESTE	I don't do dating. The right guy will show up. And I'm still on track for my 25 year plan.
SCOTT	No one has a 25 year plan. Except for my mortgage company.
CELESTE	First child at 33. Second at 35. Which means I will only be 56 at my eldest's college graduation. The bad news is that I may not be at my 4th grandchild's high school graduation. But that's okay, I guess.
SCOTT	I'm fascinated with the mentally ill.
CELESTE	I've got time. I'm not worried.
SCOTT	Well, do me a favor and get your fuck on before you meet the next guy. Celeste looks at Scott in shock.
CELESTE	What are you doing?
SCOTT	Sorry, I was trying to be your saucy gay friend. It didn't feel good.
CELESTE	Yeah don't.
SKILLZ	The economic climate is real bad, man. And I think my business is taking the hardest hit of all. It's brutal. And no one's talking about it.
JESSE	You sell pot.
SKILLZ	Not for long, dude. Have you been to those weed pharmacies? They're killing me. I gotta branch out. Maybe start working in methamphetamines? Or maybe teach pre-school. I always wanted to do that. I love kids. Skillz is distracted by something.
JESSE	I don't think it's over.
SKILLZ	What? Her butt? No, it will never be over. It goes on forever. It's like space. So great.
JESSE	No, Celeste and I. I think she's just confused and overwhelmed right now about everything. But she'll come around. She always does.
SKILLZ	Uh oh. It's been a while now. I think it's over, bro. It may be time to accept that and move on. Call that dime Veronica.
JESSE	That was a one time thing, a couple months after Celeste and I broke up. Celeste does not know about that. And we will keep it that way.
SKILLZ	Didn't know that was a hit and run. Sounded like you liked her.
JESSE	Well, she's not Celeste. It's always been Celeste. I'm not ready to give up.
SKILLZ	Okay, but remember, you can't re- heat a souffle.
JESSE	Huh?
SKILLZ	Also, there's Bettys everywhere. It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind Celeste that you can pull wool. Make her sweat a little bit.
JESSE	It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go out with somebody. They reach the front of the line.
YOGURT GIRL	Do you know what you want?
JESSE	Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I don't want to start all over again. I want everything that I believed to have been true to be true. I also want a goji berry/green tea swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity Pebbles. Please.
SKILLZ	(to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go out on a date with my friend here.
YOGURT GIRL	Um, wait, where's your wife? You guys are here like everyday together.
JESSE	Well...we're separated.
YOGURT GIRL	Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. I'll go.
BETH	It's so...grotesque.
CELESTE	But kind of beautiful. In a grotesque way.
BETH	Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many feelings.
CELESTE	Beth, the reality is I love Jesse dearly but he doesn't have a checking account. Or dress shoes. The father of my children will have a car. But...Jesse will always be my best friend.
BETH	Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's your life. But I definitely don't think he should be living in your guest house. I think you're kind of breaking his heart. Slowly.
CELESTE	Jesse is fine.
BETH	Can I show you something?
CELESTE	Sure.
BETH	Okay. Look.
CELESTE	What am I looking at?
BETH	It's a hair. On my NECK.
CELESTE	Ewww. Will you get that thing lasered off, please? What the fuck?
BETH	I can't because it will pop up somewhere else where I can't keep my eye on it.
CELESTE	Are you serious? That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. It's not a turnip.
BETH	Trust me, I know my body. It's a cruel land mine.
CELESTE	Okay, well at least pluck it for Chrissake.
BETH	I should, at least before my wedding, right?
CELESTE	What is wrong with you?
BETH	(in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!
CELESTE	Sorry sir, my friend has a really strong emotional reaction to modern art.
BETH	That was fucking rude.
CELESTE	Had to be done.
CELESTE	Hey...you're not working? Are you watching the Olympics? Again? And crying? Again? Jesse blows his nose.
JESSE	Yeah.
CELESTE	God, you really love that, don't you?
JESSE	Matthias' wife died in a car accident last year.
CELESTE	Well, three years ago now but...
JESSE	And he dedicated his gold medal to her. The human spirit is...unbreakable. Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.
CELESTE	Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that artwork for the Pop Form website?
JESSE	Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm working on it. I think you'll really like it.
CELESTE	I'll like it more when I have it because I needed it yesterday, so...
JESSE	Celeste, can you sit down for a minute? I have something really important to tell you.
CELESTE	Oh. Okay. Does it have something to do with the work you owe me?
JESSE	I don't know how to tell you this but...I have a date tonight. I'm gonna start dating. People.
CELESTE	A date? Really? That is so great.
JESSE	It is? You don't...
CELESTE	Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you, Jess.
JESSE	That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay. Well, it's actually the Yogurt Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
CELESTE	Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's cute! But so young, right?
JESSE	Super young. Her body is all-time.
CELESTE	Okay, no need for that. But this is good! You gotta crawl before you walk. I mean she's definitely not gonna be wifey number two, right? Ha.
JESSE	Well, it's just a date.
CELESTE	Big move. I'm proud of you.
JESSE	Thanks?
CELESTE	Can I get up now?
JESSE	Huh? Yeah, sure.
CELESTE	No, nothing. Are you gonna wear your hair like that?
JESSE	What? Oh. I don't know, is it weird?
CELESTE	Not weird, just different from how it looks best.
JESSE	Anyway, this is what we're doing right? We're getting divorced and we're friends and we're also dating people? That's what we're doing?
CELESTE	There. Better. You'll be great. You don't even need to be great. Just be you. Take her somewhere nice.
JESSE	Okay mom.
CELESTE	Call me after?
YOGURT GIRL	So I was in school but then I dropped out because I really wanted to work in fashion but it's really hard to find a paid internship? So I went back to school and now I work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm really looking to make money doing something I love? But I'm sure the universe is looking out for me and when the time is right, the right thing will come along, you know?
CELESTE	Where is it? They told me it would be in new releases...
BETH	Well you probably shouldn't steal it. Even if it is yours.
CELESTE	There.
BETH	But you don't have the "O" on your cover, you can't do that!
CELESTE	Yes I can.
JESSE	There you guys are...you're on Oprah's Book List?? That's so great!
CELESTE	Some people are browsing my book. Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...
JESSE	Veronica?
VERONICA	Yeah, hey. How are you?
JESSE	Good, good. You look great.
VERONICA	Thanks, you too. How's your clothes pin collage going?
JESSE	Slowly, but it's going.
VERONICA	Well, don't give up. Your work is really unique. And beautiful. I hope that doesn't sound...
JESSE	No, that's means a lot, thank you.
VERONICA	I had a lot of fun too.
JESSE	Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth and Tucker and Celeste.
VERONICA	Oh, this is your book? I read an excerpt online, it's really compelling.
CELESTE	Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
VERONICA	Well, nice to see you.
JESSE	Oh you too. Take care.
CELESTE	What is that?
JESSE	That was uh...Veronica.
CELESTE	Story?
JESSE	No story. Just this girl I met a while ago.
CELESTE	Huh. She's pretty. Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for other shoppers to hear.
SKILLZ	Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I neeeeeed...
JESSE	And you say he's just a friend, and you say he's just a friend....
JESSE SKILLZ	Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu.... Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes up.
SKILLZ	No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
JESSE	Uh, I just need to...(picks up) Hey.
SKILLZ	(whispering) Nooooo!
JESSE	(talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay. Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up) Uh, I'm gonna go home.
SKILLS	Come on, after the show it's the after party.
JESSE	There's an Ikea dresser that she needs me to "build." Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.
SKILLZ	Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you guys...
JESSE	I told you pal, I know what I'm know I'm doing. She just needed time.
CELESTE	I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!
JESSE	Oh baby youuuuu....
CELESTE	It was definitely easier to build the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
JESSE	Well, how hard can it be? It's a dresser, right?
JESSE	Fuck me!!! Do you think they intentionally pick a random piece of furniture to make totally unbuildable, just to fuck with you??!
CELESTE	Thank you!
JESSE	Wait. I got it.
CELESTE	Perfect.
JESSE	Fucking lay-up. We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They laugh; they are pretty drunk.
CELESTE	Ruscha meets Basquiat...
JESSE	...meets Serra meets Corky from "Life Goes On."
CELESTE	Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
JESSE	Cherish. That is so cute. They share a laugh.
CELESTE	You're cute. Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets hotter. They fall back.
CELESTE	Hey. What are you doing?
JESSE	I love you. Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.
CELESTE	Okay...
JESSE	We should talk about this.
CELESTE	Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a bad idea. I'm sorry.
JESSE	Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I love you.
CELESTE	Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were drunk, and the dresser and I thought...you're dating other people!
JESSE	Only to...god, I'm so stupid. He realizes how pathetic it sounds.
CELESTE	Oh no, I thought...
JESSE	You thought what?
CELESTE	Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or I wouldn't have let it happen. Come on Jess, we're not getting back together, you didn't think... Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up and leaves. He turns.
JESSE	You know, there's a guy that you can call, from Ikea, that will build you're dresser. You should call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
CELESTE	Jess! No, I didn't..Jess! Celeste collapses back in the bed.
PAUL	Hello.
CELESTE	What?
PAUL	I said hello.
CELESTE	Oh. Hi. Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome, tries to keep up with her.
PAUL	(a little too loud) How was your practice?
CELESTE	My practice?? It was...wait, what?...it was fine. (who is this guy?)
PAUL	I see you in class a lot. You have a great warrior two. Are you single?
CELESTE	Are you really doing this right now? You're really doing this right now.
PAUL	Yeah, I can't believe it either. I don't do this, it's just happening, I can't stop...it...what do you do?
CELESTE	Just gonna jump right in there. Wow, Captain Conversation.
PAUL	Paul. Here's my card.
CELESTE	You bring cards to yoga??
PAUL	Look, you're really pretty. I'm not good at this. Help.
CELESTE	(she looks at the card.) A financial analyst. Cool.
PAUL	Not really. It's not cool. Did you ever tell me what you did for a living?
CELESTE	No, no I didn't.
PAUL	Well, will you? I'd love to know.
CELESTE	I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast trends. Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.
PAUL	Trend forecaster. Really? Huh. They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with purpose.
CELESTE	You traded in your Porsche for an Audi because the economy is tanking and you're afraid you'll lose your job soon. You bought a Samsung cell phone because you think it makes you seem more "business-oriented," unlike the iPhone which is for teenage girls. You go to yoga because you went to a sub Ivy League college, spent the last ten years working long weeks and drinking all weekend and you feel like it's time to do something "spiritual." Nice to meet you, (looks at the card) Paul. Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.
CELESTE	No, just make sure the San Fran focus group has a little more diversity than last time. It was like a rave. Without drugs. Okay. She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.
VERONICA	I'm glad you called. Jesse smiles big.
CELESTE	Hey. It's me. Again. I miss you. Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye. She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:
JESSE	(on the phone) Hey. You're back. I want to talk to you.
CELESTE	Yeah, I want to talk to you too. Where have you been?? It's been like two weeks. So much to lay down...like, did you know that pay- per-view porn is available in Cantonese?
JESSE	Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? Wait, actually, I'm really close to your house right now. Can I come by for a minute? It's....important.
JESSE	Okay. I have to tell you something.
CELESTE	Me too. Wait, you first. Are you gay?
JESSE	No, not gay. He takes a really deep breath.
CELESTE	(playfully) Oh no, did you go on another date?
JESSE	I'm having a baby.
CELESTE	I don't understand.
JESSE	I'm having a baby.
CELESTE	What do you mean?
JESSE	I am having a baby.
CELESTE	With another person?
JESSE	Yes. With another person.
CELESTE	Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused. Wait, what? What the fuck? With whom?
JESSE	With Veronica.
CELESTE	Veronica?? What's a Veronica?
JESSE	You actually met her. That day at the book store.
CELESTE	Huh. But that's not even physically possible, that was two weeks ago.
JESSE	Well, the truth is, I slept with Veronica three months ago. It was just a one night thing. But she's pregnant.
CELESTE	Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about that. But that's not important right now. This is not good. Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna deal with this. We will, we'll just have to. What do you need me to do?
JESSE	No, you don't have to do anything.
CELESTE	But you don't even know this person, right?
JESSE	Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm getting to know her. And I really want to make it work with her.
CELESTE	Make it work?? You slept with her once! What are you talking about?
JESSE	I've actually been seeing her, well, a lot, recently. And I think I really like her.
CELESTE	So what you're saying is you got a girl pregnant and now you think you like her because she's pregnant? Or...I'm really confused.
JESSE	The universe is fucking weird, Celeste. I slept with her months ago and never called her after.
JESSE	But we started hanging recently and she told me she was pregnant with my child. I know it's crazy, but it just feels...right. It was like this really weird retroactive gift. I don't know...
CELESTE	Can you excuse me for a second? Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this really happening?
CELESTE	Sorry about that. I had something in my eye.
JESSE	Right. Look, I know this is so sudden. And so weird. I've been holding on to us, this idea of us, for so long. And I know you've wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry. You were right, we're friends. We will always be friends. And I need that now.
CELESTE	Of course.
JESSE	Thank you. Love you. Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.
CELESTE	It was nothing. She forces a smile.
SCOTT	Hello?
CELESTE	Hey. Celeste lets out a guffaw.
SCOTT	What are you doing?
CELESTE	I'm just following Diddy Twitty.
SCOTT	I don't...know what that means.
CELESTE	It's Sean Comb's Twitter page. There's also a singing competition on television. It's called American Idol? Keep up.
SCOTT	Okay saucy. You don't have to be so saucy.
CELESTE	Well, just part of our job, so...ready for breaking news? Jesse is having a baby with some girl. Crazy.
SCOTT	Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was seeing someone?
CELESTE	It's this girl he slept with once a couple of months ago.
CELESTE	And now he's "making it work" with her. Plane crash.
SCOTT	I don't know what to say. I am so sorry, Celeste.
CELESTE	No need, Scott, I'm totally fine.
SCOTT	Are you?
CELESTE	Look, I wasn't going to have his baby. So, good for him.
SCOTT	Well, it's great that you're so resolved about this but it's also okay for you to have feelings. It's very sudden.
CELESTE	Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, nope, I'm fine. I promise. Not in love with him anymore. It kind of makes it easier.
SCOTT	Um...that's great. Who's the guy?
CELESTE	The yahoo who did Pop Form's taxes last quarter. He's been asking me out forever. Not the one, but it'll be nice to be admired.
SCOTT	I agree, go be admired. Who knows, you may actually even simulate human emotion.
CELESTE	Thank you. She hands the menu back to the waiter.
MAX	Well, actually I... Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.
CELESTE	OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, oh no, we just made eye contact. Maybe he didn't see me. Wait, he did. He's coming over. Oh god, this is so awkward.(to Max) You should probably leave.
MAX	Wait, what? I don't think...really?
CELESTE	Yeah, just go. Jesse is at the table.
JESSE	I just wanted to say hi. I'm Jesse.
CELESTE	Oh, this is Matt.
MAX	Max.
CELESTE	Mack.
MAX	Max.
JESSE	Nice to meet you, Max.
CELESTE	We're just here. Just eating. It's a date. I'm dating.
JESSE	Cool. The puttanesca special is the thing to get.
MAX	Good to know. I ordered that.
CELESTE	Who are you here with?
JESSE	Oh, just here alone. Watching the Lakers.
MAX	Kobe-LeBron tonight, right?
JESSE	Yes. Epic.
MAX	So psyched I tivo'ed it.
JESSE	Nice to meet you, man. Good to see you, C.
MAX CELESTE
MAX	He's cool.
CELESTE	Uh huh. Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just arrived. She's quiet.
MAX	How was that? Are you okay?
CELESTE	I'm fine! Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar.
MAX	What?
CELESTE	Nothing. Do you like bread?
MAX	Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread.
CELESTE	Cool, cool. Silence, once again.
CELESTE	This was great! I'm free next Wednesday? Sushi?
MAX	Um, I don't think we should.
CELESTE	Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I think that's a myth. I go to this acupuncturist that...
MAX	No, I think you may need some time. To get over, you know, your divorce. It took me a long time to start dating after mine.
CELESTE	Thank you for your concern but I'm just fine. I guess you're just not a match for me.
MAX	Well, have a good night. Good luck. Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there, confused and alone. She shakes him off.
CELESTE	(sotto) Whatever.
CELESTE	Hi honey!
BETH	Hi, wow, you are really out of breath. Did you fucking run here?? From West Hollywood??
CELESTE	Yeah I ran. Just started. It's really fun.
BETH	You're soaking wet. Isn't that like 12 miles??
CELESTE	13.5 actually. I was just clearing my head, you know, keeping the endorphins up.
BETH	Do you...want to sit down?
CELESTE	Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? It's so nice. Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman approaches.
SALESWOMAN	I'm so sorry but that's a one-of-a- kind piece that was handwoven by a tribe of Afghani women. So if you could maybe just sit over there? The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable looking chair.
CELESTE	Right. Sorry. Totally.
BETH	Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.
CELESTE	You should get it. It's really pretty. Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celeste's entire body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.
BETH	Uh boy.
CELESTE	Don't worry. I know people who can get that out. Easily.
BETH	Okay. I guess I'm getting it.
CELESTE	The Riley account is a handful. I've been sooooo swamped.
BETH	It's great you're staying busy...
CELESTE	(about the couch) If it doesn't come out, I can have it reupholstered.
BETH	Thanks. How's dating?
SALESWOMAN	Sorry, can I get your card?
BETH	Here you go.
CELESTE	Great. Dating's really great.
BETH	Have you talked to Jesse?
CELESTE	No, but I actually ran into him last night. I think he's getting a little fat.
BETH	I think he's been looking pretty fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can I get a rush delivery on that?
CELESTE	So you've seen Jesse?
BETH	...Yeah, I have.
CELESTE	Huh. Have you hung out with...
BETH	Veronica?
CELESTE	Yeah.
BETH	Yes. I have.
SALESWOMAN	So, my first available delivery is Monday afternoon. Does that work for you?
BETH	Yeah, that's fine. If you can you just call my cell...
CELESTE	She's dumb, right?
BETH	Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple.
CELESTE	Simple means dumb.
BETH	No, actually, simple in a really elegant way.
CELESTE	Elegant??
SALESWOMAN	Okay, so you're all set then.
CELESTE	Elegant??
BETH	Thanks a lot. (to Celeste)
CELESTE	I am, I just didn't realize that Monica was "elegant."
BETH	Veronica. And you know what? You would probably really like her.
CELESTE	Not one.
BETH	Please let me drive you home. I'm afraid you'll drown.
CELESTE	Sure. I have a date tonight so I should probably shower before then. Beth looks at a sopping Celeste.
BETH	Yes. Shower. Who's the date?
CELESTE	Rupert Bates.
BETH	Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my god, he's so hot but he's like 15.
CELESTE	22. Skillz set me up. He's about to be a huge star. He's filming "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to
BETH	Fuck, I LOVED that movie.
SALESWOMAN	I loved that movie too! It really spoke to me.
CELESTE	That was so...good.
RUPERT	I wrote that for my mum.
CELESTE	Lucky lady. So how do you know Skillz?
RUPERT	He provides me with the happy smoky green treats.
CELESTE	(sotto) Ew. Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.
RUPERT	Hello, Special One.
CELESTE	Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no, no, no I gotta go.
RILEY	Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks like straw. Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.
SAVANNAH	Here. Do you want an Adderall?
RILEY	No, that shit makes me feel like a robot. Speaking of robot, who the hell designed this place? It's like Spock and his eyebrows are about to walk around the corner.
CELESTE	Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a partner at Pop Form.
RILEY	Hey. Wow, you're pretty.
SAVANNAH	Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?
RILEY	Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.
CELESTE	Um...it's actually regimen?
RILEY	Sorry?
CELESTE	Regime is a system of government. It's a "skin regimen."
RILEY	Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.
CELESTE	Charming.
SCOTT	Celeste has some ideas for the logo which are looking really great. He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley catches her and looks away uncomfortably.
CELESTE	Right. Yes. Sorry. So we are going for an industrial feel with the artwork...
SCOTT	Hello, Special One.
CELESTE	Uh, you got my IM.
SCOTT	Sounds so awful.
CELESTE	Where are the guys who don't wear makeup for a living? And maybe a little intellect? A little intellect wouldn't hurt anybody. Scott has an idea.
SCOTT	Wait, wait. You've never met Nick, right? Nick Moran?
CELESTE	The photographer? You know him?
SCOTT	Yeah, we went to school together. This could be perfect.
CELESTE	(she sings, like she's in a musical) I'm uncomfortable with daaaaaating. I don't like any of iiiiiit.
SCOTT	(he sings back) Trust meeeee. You will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love cooo-ooock.
CELESTE	You really got to try a little harder to integrate the gayness, Scott.
CELESTE	So you pissed in your pants?
NICK	I waited seven hours. Three of them soaking in my own pee. But I finally got the shot of Ahmadinejad. He hands her a photograph.
CELESTE	Wow. That is incredible. I think he's smiling, maybe.
NICK	He is. I think the piss stain running down my jeans made him laugh.
CELESTE	Well, the world will think you're brilliant. No one will ever know but me.
NICK	I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I didn't win.
CELESTE	Well, the guy who won shit his pants, so... They laugh. They are connecting.
NICK	(looking at his watch) Oh my god, we missed our reservation. It was at 8:30. Should I call down and see if they can still take us?
CELESTE	How about room service?
NICK	Perfect.
CELESTE	That was really, really nice.
NICK	Um, yeah. So, what are you doing for the rest of your life?
CELESTE	Making out with you. They start to kiss again.
NICK	(whisper)What do you think I'm doing?
CELESTE	(whisper) Why are you doing that? Don't do that..It was going so well.
NICK	Shhhhh. Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps going. Eyes closed.
CELESTE	Almost where?? No! Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of dodge.
NICK	Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize she's gone.
CELESTE	Vegan Vittles.
CELESTE	No, I don't want to do a video chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she hangs up, now on the Blackberry) Sorry, one second, I just have to send this e-mail. Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to finish her e-mail.
JESSE	Hi. What's up?
CELESTE	A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some coffee?
WAITRESS	We have yerba matte?
CELESTE	Um, green tea?
WAITRESS	We have decaf green tea.
CELESTE	Water's fine.
WAITRESS	K. Anything for you?
JESSE	I'll get the veganchilada with the cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh can I look at the seaweed menu? She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper.
CELESTE	Wow.
JESSE	How are you? You look great.
CELESTE	Thanks.
JESSE	Oh yeah, they're vegan.
CELESTE	You look good too.
JESSE	A lot of pilates.
CELESTE	Huh, I didn't know you did pilates.
JESSE	Yeah, well, Veronica's a dancer and has equipment at our house, so...
CELESTE	Um...work is great.
JESSE	Good.
CELESTE	My book is getting great reviews. Riley Banks is a new client which is huge. Things are going really well.
JESSE	Great.
CELESTE	It's only weird if you think it's weird.
JESSE	Celeste, I never wanted to hurt you.
CELESTE	Thank you. You didn't. Glad we cleared that up.
JESSE	Look, I actually wanted to see you because...apparently there's some kind of hold up on your side with the divorce papers and Veronica's actually not a citizen so..
CELESTE	What? Where's she from?
JESSE	Uh, Belgium.
CELESTE	(sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.
JESSE	What?
CELESTE	Nothing.
JESSE	Point is, we need to...get married. I'm sorry. I really need you to sign those papers.
CELESTE	Well, Jesse, I've been busy with work. Because some people work for a living. So I haven't really been focused on what I can do to help you get on with your new life.
JESSE	I'm sorry. I know.
CELESTE	What makes you think you are even suitable to be a dad?? You don't even know how to read the electric bill. How are you going to support yourself? Have you even thought this through?
JESSE	I guess I'll have to figure it out. Veronica is really supportive of my work.
CELESTE	Really? Really Jesse? I paid the rent for ten years. If that's not supportive, I don't know what is.
JESSE	That's true. And thank you.
CELESTE	We never even talked about kids.
JESSE	You had reservations about having kids.
CELESTE	I had reservations about having kids with YOU.
JESSE	Well, ditto. I think Veronica will be a really good mother.
CELESTE	Low blow.
RESTAURANT GUY	Um, yeah. I do.
CELESTE	Exactly. Get a real job. Celeste exits.
CELESTE	Jesse's a fucking vegan??
BETH	A vegan who's soon to have his work shown. At the Gagosian.
CELESTE	The Gagosian?? You're kidding. What, the fucking clothespin thing? When??
CELESTE	Don't tell me actually...how did anybody even know about his art, he doesn't...I don't actually want to know...god, he's on fire right now. Breaking up with me was the best thing that ever happened to Jesse. I should break up with me.
BETH	Now, now. Someone else's success is not your demise, C.
CELESTE	Shut up. Unless it's Jesse's. Who are dressed as again?
BETH	Beiber.
CELESTE	Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.
BETH	Really? Fuck. When??
CELESTE	A couple hours ago. It was on Perez.
BETH	That's so sad. His hair was everything.
CELESTE	I need to fucking drink.
PETER PAN	We're doing Car Bombs in the kitchen. Wanna come?
BETH	Noooo.
CELESTE	YES.
SNOW WHITE	What are you?
CELESTE	What? Oh, White trash. Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.
SNOW WHITE	(doesn't get it) Huh. Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and wasted.
PAUL	Celeste?
CELESTE	Yoga?
PAUL	Yeah, I haven't seen you there for a while.
CELESTE	I've been running a lot. Keeps you in better shape.
PAUL	I can see that's important to you. (referring to the Car Bomb in her
FACE)	Celeste is now drunk.
CELESTE	How's your practice? (waving her finger in his face, laughing)
PAUL	White trash?
CELESTE	Uh huh. What are you?
PAUL	Um, a cereal killer, obviously.
CELESTE	You're "punny."
PAUL	By the way, you were right.
CELESTE	About what?
PAUL	About me. All of it, the car, the phone, the yoga. Except that I did go to an Ivy League school. Cornell.
CELESTE	Barely an Ivy.
PAUL	I know.
CELESTE	Do you smoke?
PAUL	At parties.
CELESTE	Me too. Let's go.
PAUL	(Playful) Sorry about that day at the gym. I feel really open after yoga...
CELESTE	Shhhh. Don't say open. Your costume's great. Don't ruin it.
PAUL	I'm kidding. I only go to yoga to meet girls. Speaking of, what's the deal with you and me? Is this happening? Or...
CELESTE	My husband of six years wants a divorce so he can marry the woman who's carrying his child. That's the deal with you and me.
PAUL	I'm sorry, that sounds tough.
CELESTE	He's having a baby with a girl he barely knows. He's so lost. He's just going about it all...wrong.
PAUL	And you're right. Now what?
CELESTE	What do you mean?
PAUL	Well do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?
CELESTE	Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be right, I AM right. People will let you down. I've accepted that fact, but unfortunately, most of the time, knowing that does keep you from being happy. But at least it's real.
PAUL	No one has ever given a more self- righteous monologue wearing only a trash bag. Except for maybe the homeless guy outside my dry cleaners.
BETH	Time to go, drunky.
PAUL	(yells to Celeste) Call me!
CELESTE	Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I still have a bunch of your stuff in the office. You should probably grab it at some point. Okay. She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to Jesse.
BEAT:
VERONICA	You're going to be a really good dad.
JESSE	What? Why did you say that? Veronica studies Jesse's face.
VERONICA	I don't know, I just know it.
JESSE	No one's ever said that to me.
CELESTE	At least they recycle.
JESSE	This is...so weird but I just realized...what's your middle name? I don't even know it. They laugh a little.
VERONICA	It's um...Godelieve.
JESSE	Goldleaf?
VERONICA	No, Goldelieve. It means loved by the Gods. It's Dutch.
JESSE	Sweet. Mine's Mordechai.
VERONICA	What does it mean?
JESSE	Means I'm really Jewish. Veronica giggles. They're getting to know each other. It's awkward...but sweet.
CELESTE	Guitar Hero?? That's quite an extravagant purchase for a freelance writer and his "elegant" Belgian bride.
JESSE	Celeste?
CELESTE	Hey!
JESSE	What...are you doing?
CELESTE	I just...
JESSE	But why were you in the trash can?
CELESTE	I lost something.
JESSE	In the trash can?
CELESTE	My bracelet. It was a whole thing. It's over now.
JESSE	You've met Veronica, right?
CELESTE	Yes! Hi! Wow, you're so pregnant, right! I love your sweater.
VERONICA	Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you bleeding?
CELESTE	What? Oh (she touches her cheek), yeah, I guess I am.
VERONICA	Let me get you something for that.
CELESTE	NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a little cut.
VERONICA	Are you sure? I'm so sorry about this.
CELESTE	No, I'm sorry. So sorry. Well, I'm late for things. Have a good afternight.
VERONICA	You sure you don't want to come in for a drink?
CELESTE	Nooooo, no. That's very nice but no. Great to see you guys! Okay.
JESSE	Is that mine?
CELESTE	Waht? Oh, yeah, that's weird. I don't know how...here you go. She laughs nervously and hands him his journal. Celeste walks to her car.
BETH	You told her you liked her sweater? What are you, twelve?
CELESTE	It was a disaster. But you should have seen the sweater. So great. Beth, am I losing my mind?
BETH	Maybe. No. Please no more trash- diving. Let's focus on you now.
CELESTE	This guys Paul keeps calling me but I don't know...
BETH	C, you never know. Just go out with him. It doesn't have to be perfect...
CELESTE	I met him at the gym. I'm not meeting my husband at the gym.
BETH	Just go. Nothing to lose.
CELESTE	So where do you live? We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about to get thai massages.
PAUL	Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.
CELESTE	Cool.
PAUL	You are gonna love this place. You've never felt so relaxed in your life. Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work. Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her head, not the most comfortable position.
CELESTE	Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) Wow, this is a unique place to take a date.
PAUL	Yeah, I take all my dates here.
CELESTE	I feel special.
PAUL	You are. They all are. Celeste giggles. Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her elbow into his shoulderblade.
CELESTE	Not...that well. I've been on a real winning streak, so I thought I'd call you.
PAUL	You know what? I'm happy you did. At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it looks like she may have broken her back.
CELESTE	AHHHH! I don't know what your definition of relaxing is but...
PAUL	Just wait. Trust me, you need this right now.
CELESTE	Why would you take me to a place where Asian people beat you up? That was absolute torture.
PAUL	But how do you feel? Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.
CELESTE	I feel great, actually.
PAUL	So shut up then.
CELESTE	Where are we going now?
PAUL	Don't try to control me. You need to let go. In yoga, we call it vairyaga. He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.
CELESTE	Oh my god, don't, with the yoga.
CELESTE	This place is...really cool.
PAUL	You sound surprised.
CELESTE	I am, Westwood condo.
PAUL	I'll get us beers. Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it, trying to look a little better.
CELESTE	Ohh!! Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul quickly, to his surprise.
PAUL	What was that for?
CELESTE	Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not everything has to have a reason.
ECU OF	Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly.
SKILLZ	Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming up...degree of difficulty 9. Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, Becky!!! Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at "Veronica and Jesse Baby Registry"
JESSE	What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?
SKILLZ	It's a very, very tiny Swedish man.
TUCKER	It's a baby carrier that allows your child to benefit from parental intimacy without the confinement of a stroller. Duh.
JESSE	Why do you know that.
TUCKER	Beth. We go to a lot of baby showers.
SKILLZ	I put a lot of babies in the ladies. A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse is still going through the registry list.
JESSE	Birthing towels, breast pump, Diaper genie? Fuck, I'm definitely having a baby. (beat) How's Celeste?
SKILLZ	She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her cannibus levels right now, just trying to find the right balance.
JESSE	Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
SKILLZ	She does now. She loves it.
TUCKER	How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
JESSE	Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's probably just hormones.
TUCKER	But are you into it?
JESSE	Yeah, I really like her. She seems great. For someone that I don't really know that's having my baby.
SKILLZ	MY JAM!
TUCKER	Are you scared?
JESSE	A little. Yes.
TUCKER	That's great. You should be. Just keep saying "yes." I'm really proud of you.
SKILLZ	She's like my top client now.
SKILLZ	Step out of the shadows and into the light. Are you crying?
CELESTE	I don't know what I'm doing. Dating is stupid and all of a sudden, my ex-husband bakes cakes? It's probably fucking gluten-free.
SKILLZ	What?
CELESTE	Nothing. Can you just roll a joint please? Skillz rolls a tight joint.
SKILLZ	Day by day, C. You need not trip. Celeste takes a drag.
CELESTE	What are they like together?
SKILLZ	Who? Jesse and Veronica?
CELESTE	Yeah.
SKILLZ	You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is trying. It's not all rainbows and unicorns but...
CELESTE	So he's not happy.
SKILLZ	I didn't say that.
RILEY	I really like the logo.
CELESTE	Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's perfect.
RILEY	The I.M. Pei influence is pretty cool.
CELESTE	Wow, yeah, there is a little of that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
RILEY	Are you mocking me?
CELESTE	No, I'm just impressed that you know anything about architecture.
RILEY	Why, because I'm a pop star? You know what your thing is? Contempt prior to investigation.
CELESTE	I'm sorry?
RILEY	You're convinced you're smarter than everyone and THAT is your dark little prison.
CELESTE	Are you...?? How dare you... Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.
CELESTE	Dark little prison?? Bitch, what does she know. You know what's a dark little prison?? Having to wear midriffs for a living. What does she... Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse, sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette.
JESSE	I started smoking again.
CELESTE	I can see that. That must go well with your pilates. Jesse looks sad and confused.
JESSE	I don't know what the rules are and I'm sure I'm breaking them but...god, I really miss you. Celeste tries to digest this.
CELESTE	You want to come in?
JESSE	Veronica is friends with the assistant gallerist there and he just really loved my stuff. I don't know, we'll see...
CELESTE	Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy for you.
JESSE	Yeah, yeah. It's great. Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the drink.
CELESTE	Yeah. It's really nice to see you. He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one second, very tenderly. She pulls away.
JESSE	Can we just...lay here for a bit? Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence.
CELESTE	Yeah.
SCOTT	We have a massive problem on our hands. I need you in the office. Now.
CELESTE	I don't see anything.
SCOTT	(referring to the logo) It's a penis. And a butt.
CELESTE	What? Really? I don't see it.
SCOTT	You can't be serious. (points to the logo) There's the penis. And there's the penis going into the butt.
CELESTE	I think it's a stretch.
SCOTT	Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste. Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips comes on.
NEWSCASTER	...teenagers were hoping to get a little bit of the teen star's fashion magic but instead, they have been suprised by what they saw.
PARENT	There's homosexual butt sex in the logo. Does Riley think we're that stupid?? I will never support gay marriage.
NEWSCASTER	Neither Riley nor a representative from Pop Form-the marketing company responsible-could be reached for comment. Scott turns it off.
SCOTT	Celeste, what did you do. How could be so careless? Celeste picks up the magnified logo again.
CELESTE	Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. Hahahahaaha. Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest thing she's ever seen.
SCOTT	(fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.
CELESTE	Scott, come on...
SCOTT	No, this is not a joke. Our company's in serious danger.
CELESTE	You're being dramatic.
SCOTT	Get out. I can't, with you, right now. I have to deal with this. I'll call you soon. Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.
CELESTE	No...okay.
JESSE	Hey.
CELESTE	Hey.
JESSE	We gotta talk.
CELESTE	I know. That's why I called.
JESSE	Celeste...
CELESTE	Wait, let me say something. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what's happening with your other situation. But I need to say this. For the record, I fucked up. I was cavalier about you. I took us for granted. And I know this may sound crazy but I'd be remiss if I didn't...if you were open to it...I think that I could do better. With you. With us. If there's a chance still...I'd like to know. Jesse can't even look at her.
JESSE	I'm sorry. I can't. Jesse gets up and leaves.
CELESTE	Hey! Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.
JESSE	I don't know.
CELESTE	Oh no, I think you do.
JESSE	I made a mistake.
CELESTE	And?
JESSE	I shouldn't have come.
CELESTE	You're a fucking coward.
JESSE	I'm just trying to do the right thing with Veronica. I'm trying to change.
CELESTE	Well, you never changed for me. Jesse pauses.
JESSE	To be honest, you didn't really let me.
CELESTE	Wow. All I did was wait for you to grow up! I rooted for you, I fucking paid for everything, I did everything for you!
JESSE	Yeah, and I was never your equal. And you know what? I think you preferred it that way.
CELESTE	Right. Well, I know my success was never easy for you.
JESSE	And how do you define success, Celeste? Because you don't look very successful right now.
CELESTE	And you are? Pretending to be a father? Pretending to be an adult?
JESSE	What do you want?
CELESTE	I just want you to admit that you're wrong!
JESSE	Wrong? Wrong about what? What did you want me to do? Wait for you to meet someone first? Is that how you saw it happening?
CELESTE	You know what, Jesse? You definitely will blow it.
JESSE	I feel really sorry for you. You might be alone forever.
CELESTE	Don't ever call me.
JESSE	Don't worry about it. Jesse walks away.
CELESTE	She's so sad.
SKILLZ	Is she? I don't think so.
CELESTE	No, she's sad. I can tell. I went to dance camp. We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.
SKILLZ	Shit'll get better.
CELESTE	Will it? You don't know that. Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.
SKILLZ	J-Thunder? He's not doing anything to you. You wanted a divorce.
CELESTE	But I didn't want it like this.
SKILLZ	When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.
CELESTE	Huh?
SKILLZ	Oh. It's Victor Frankl.
CELESTE	Huh.
SKILLZ	I gotta go before Petco closes.
CELESTE	You have a pet?
SKILLZ	No, but I gotta get a toy for this girl's cat, you know, so she'll give up the kitty.
CELESTE	Can I come?
SKILLZ	No.
CELESTE	Will you bring me some Panda Express?
SKILLZ	No.
CELESTE	Do you think the Obamas are really in love?
SKILLZ	Yes. Enough questions. I'll pick you up at noon.
CELESTE	Noon?
SKILLZ	Beth and Tucker's pre-wedding BBQ?
CELESTE	Right, right.
SKILLZ	Hey, easy on the herb until then. That shit is powerful.
BETH	Hi honey, you remember Eileen from...
CELESTE	Do you have any more of that ranch dressing? It's the fucking booooooomb. Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60, very large, a big sloppy hug.
BETH	Let's get you a soda. They get to the bar.
CELESTE	Do you guys have any tequila?
BARTENDER	We only have Mimosas and Shandys.
CELESTE	I'll have both please. Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the house and plops her down on the couch.
BETH	I'm going to recommend some quiet time for you right now.
CELESTE	Can I smoke?
BETH	No. Celeste starts weeping.
CELESTE	I don't want to be alone forever.
BETH	Not forever, honey. Just until you sober up. You'll be fine.
CELESTE	Okay then, I'll just go to the other side of the pool. I promise I won't make you look bad.
BETH	At least she's quiet now.
SKILLZ	I'm gonna get her out of here.
CELESTE	(on the phone) Hey Riley, it's Celeste. I just want to talk to you about this "error" in your logo. I'm so, so sorry, I will fix this...call me.
BETH	I just think it's corny to wear white two nights in a row. I want to rock a pattern, or maybe something in pastel...
CELESTE	What the fuck does Riley Banks know.
BETH	Um...nothing. She's a tart.
CELESTE	Yeah dude! She's fucking moderately talented, blessed with a good face and has maybe 5 more years left of stardom. Who is she to tell ME what...
RILEY	I need to talk to you. Come to my house. Now.
CELESTE	Oh boy.
CELESTE	The thing is, I have been having a really hard time in my life, everything is sort of falling apart and when you said that thing about contempt and investigation, it just sort of hit a nerve and...
RILEY	Just, shut up for a minute. Riley is in tears.
CELESTE	Oh. God, I'm sorry. I didn't even know you had a boyfriend.
RILEY	Nobody knew. He didn't want anybody to know. Fucking ass hole. And now, my career might be over because you put a penis in my logo. Thank you for that. Riley is clearly destroyed.
CELESTE	So you called the smartest person you know. Riley smiles through her tears.
RILEY	Are you crying? Celeste turns off the television.
CELESTE	Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of someone.
RILEY	A guy?
CELESTE	Yeah. A guy.
RILEY	You miss him?
CELESTE	Yeah, I do.
RILEY	They all fucking suck.
CELESTE	Kind of.
RILEY	So it never gets better?
CELESTE	No, it doesn't. But you do. You're gonna be fine.
CELESTE	Hi...I know I won't...no I'm on the road already! Near...Bakersfield? Of course I'll be there...love you too. She hangs up and was clearly lying. She must do something. Something she does not want to do. She looks at the stoic woman in front of her.
PRIEST	I now pronounce you husband and wife. Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see Celeste in the audience, clapping. She looks beat down and tired.
GIRL #1	She pursued her love of Spanish men, but missed her Tucker, more than just as a friend.
GIRL #2	And our princess returned home to her loving prince, and they've been together ever since.
GIRL #2	And now we're gonna hear from Celeste, Beth's best friend in the world.
CELESTE	Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, that was so...wow. There are no words. Well, this is gonna sound bad but I actually forgot that I was speaking tonight.
JESSE	I know this may not the best time to talk about this...but...at some point, we will have to talk about Tucker's dance moves. INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.
CELESTE	He is so special. Not as special as that poem. That those girls did?
JESSE CELESTE	Wow. Wow.
JESSE	Your speech was really...beautiful. Thank you.
CELESTE	I meant it.
JESSE	I know.
CELESTE	You know what else is beautiful?
JESSE	Aw yeah! Fuck!
VERONICA	Jesse?
JESSE	Hey.
VERONICA	What are you doing?
JESSE	What? Nothing. We're just...
CELESTE	Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where we find the littlest thing that resembles a penis and we just, you know...
VERONICA	I don't get it. Celeste and Jesse stop.
CELESTE	It's stupid. Veronica is looking at Celete's food.
VERONICA	Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See you on the dance floor? Watch out for Tucker though. They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into the carrot.
PAUL	(keeping score on a notepad) So, that's 38 points plus 50 bonus points for using all my tiles so...
CELESTE	Wait, wait, wait. I think I may have to challenge. Zooecia?? That's not a word, that's my hoochie cousin's name!
PAUL	Are you challenging or not?
CELESTE	Yes, I definitely am.
PAUL	Well, I will tell you that Zooecia is a sac secreted by a compound organism but here you go. (he hands her the Scrabble dictionary) Look for yourself. Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently accepts defeat.
CELESTE	I've never lost a game of Scrabble in my life.
PAUL	Well, nothing lasts forever.
PAUL	I'm so sorry I beat you in Scrabble.
CELESTE	No you're not.
PAUL	You're right, I'm not. The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.
CELESTE	Will you get a condom?
PAUL	Uh...I don't think we should...
CELESTE	No, you're using a condom.
PAUL	No, I don't think we should sleep together. Celeste pulls away from him.
CELESTE	What?
PAUL	I just...I don't know.
CELESTE	Are you not into it?
PAUL	No, no believe me, I'm into it.
CELESTE	Then, what's the deal?
PAUL	I really like you.
CELESTE	Right, I'm confused...why not sleep with me then?
PAUL	Because I think I might really like you.
CELESTE	Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. Well, I like you too. Celeste looks distant.
RILEY	THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST
CELESTE	ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY
RILEY	WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN.
CELESTE	THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY,
RILEY	WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
CELESTE	THIS IS A GAY CLUB.
RILEY	IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T
CELESTE	RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.
GAY MAN	Excuse me, can you please tell your friend Riley that we worship her??
GAY MAN #2	OMG, she's so pretty!
CELESTE	Sure...
GAY MAN #2	A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!
GAY MAN	It's amazing. All of our friends are rocking it. It's like the gay Izod.
CELESTE	Wow, so, what, you just buy the biggest size they make?
GAY MAN	How dare you, I'm a size 10 in tween. I have a slight frame. They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is being adored by gay men.
RILEY	I LOVE IT HERE!!
CELESTE	Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market.
SCOTT	Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around.
CELESTE	We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously.
SALESMAN	So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble.
CELESTE	Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up.
SALESMAN	Lemme go ask my manager.
CELESTE	Thanks, dude. Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.
VERONICA	Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing?
CELESTE	Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?
VERONICA	Oh, you know getting...
CELESTE	She is?
VERONICA	Very. And so helpful right now.
CELESTE	Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized.
VERONICA	Organized, terrified.
CELESTE	You'll do great.
VERONICA	Thanks. I hope so.
CELESTE	No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash.
VERONICA	Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast.
CELESTE	Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out...
VERONICA	He's so talented.
CELESTE	Yeah, he is. An awkward silence.
VERONICA	You too. They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other.
CELESTE	Oh sorry!
VERONICA	Oh, it's okay! Bye again.
PAUL	Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be...oh God give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh
CELESTE	Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to me..
PAUL	I'm down on bended knee hee hee hee. They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers.
CELESTE	No, we ARE really good.
PAUL	Aw shit!
CELESTE	Get ready. You're first.
PAUL	Baby when I met you, there was peace on earth, I set out get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?
CELESTE	Shhh come on. Focus.
PAUL	You do something to me, that I can't explain, hold me closer, and I feel no pain. Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication.
CELESTE PAUL
CELESTE	(quietly) I can't.
PAUL	What? Come on, we're so good together. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. Get in there!! This is my favorite part!
CELESTE	No. I can't.
PAUL	I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding it. Sail away with me...
CELESTE	No. This. Us. I'm sorry.
PAUL	What do you mean?
CELESTE	I just...can't.
PAUL	Are you serious? Oh no. Why?
CELESTE	I think I need to be alone? I'm not ready. I'm having fun and I feel like I'm beginning to like you and I just don't think I'm ready for that.
PAUL	What? Really?
CELESTE	I'm so sorry. You are so...great. But I'm getting divorced.
PAUL	Celeste, I know.
CELESTE	I think I need to go through this alone.
PAUL	Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. Live by will, not by force.
CELESTE	What?
PAUL	You're only ready when you're ready, you know? Don't force it. It's just some yoga shit.
CELESTE	Thanks.
PAUL	But I do like you. I like you a lot. And when you are ready, if you're ready, call me.
AFTERNOON	Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:
CELESTE'S LAWYER	Sign here. And here. And here. Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles uncomfortably.
CELESTE	I like that tie.
JESSE	Oh, thank you.
CELESTE'S LAWYER	One more here.
CELESTE	Is it made out of organic mung beans? Jesse nods and chuckles.
JESSE	No, I actually found it digging through your trash.
CELESTE	Ohhh, I see. All right. They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste laugh.
JESSE	So...we're divorced! They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get divorced.
CELESTE	We did it.
JESSE	You wanna walk for a couple minutes?
CELESTE	Sure.
CELESTE	These are beautiful.
JESSE	I thought you hated them.
CELESTE	Yeah, well, I've never seen them at night. Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty sad.
JESSE	I'm just feeling like maybe you were right. I am a fuck up. I don't know what I'm doing. My girlfriend left.
CELESTE	What? Veronica? Left where?
JESSE	Left me. She wanted me to tell her everything was gonna be okay and I couldn't. I don't know why but I just...couldn't. She wants to go back to Brussels.
CELESTE	Hey...don't do that.
JESSE	Do what?
CELESTE	You are not a loser. You never were. You took a chance. I admire that and I believe in you.
JESSE	You do?
CELESTE	I do. And I want to thank you.
JESSE	For what?
CELESTE	For never being the person I wanted you to be.
JESSE	Oh, you're welcome.
CELESTE	Go get her.
JESSE	But I don't know if everything is gonna be all right.
CELESTE	Well, who does? Do you love her?
JESSE	I do.
CELESTE	Then it's worth fighting for.
JESSE	Okay. Okay.
CELESTE	God, I finally understand why you fucking cry all the time. Shit is emotional.
JESSE	Me too.
CELESTE	So...I guess we were right.
JESSE	Huh?
CELESTE	I love you too.
CELESTE	Hey. So, you're probably giving your card to some girl in yoga right now. But if that doesn't work out for you...I think I may be ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
CELESTE	Excuse me, sir? The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer this person. She restrains herself.
YOUNG MAN	Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My dog's in the car and he's really thirsty. So, thanks.
CELESTE	No problem. She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.
