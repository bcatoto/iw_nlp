Avengers, The (2012)

NICK FURY	How bad is it?
NICK FURY	NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test phase.
NICK FURY	What are the energy levels now?
NICK FURY	How long to get everyone out?
NICK FURY	Do better.
NICK FURY	We should tell them to go back to sleep?
NICK FURY	I need you to make sure that PHASE 2 prototypes are shipped out.
AGENT MARIA HILL	Sir, is that really a priority right now?
NICK FURY	Until such time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.
AGENT MARIA HILL	Yes, sir. (to standing agents) With me.
NICK FURY	Talk to me, doctor.
SELVIG	Director.
NICK FURY	Is there anything we know for certain?
SELVIG	Tesseract is misbehaving.
NICK FURY	Is that supposed to be funny?
SELVIG	No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's...misbehaving.
NICK FURY	How soon until you pull the plug?
SELVIG	She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...
NICK FURY	We've prepared for this, doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
SELVIG	We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
NICK FURY	That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
SELVIG	The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
NICK FURY	Agent Barton, report.
NICK FURY	I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
CLINT BARTON	Well, I see better from a distance.
NICK FURY	Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
NASA SCIENTIST	Doctor, it's spiking again.
CLINT BARTON	No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
NICK FURY	At this end?
CLINT BARTON	Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
NICK FURY	Sir, please put down the spear!
LOKI	You have heart.
LOKI	Please don't. I still need that.
NICK FURY	This doesn't have to get any messier.
LOKI	Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
SELVIG	Loki? Brother of Thor?
NICK FURY	We have no quarrel with your people.
LOKI	An ant has no quarrel with a boot.
NICK FURY	You planning to step on us?
LOKI	I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.
NICK FURY	Free from what?
LOKI	Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...
LOKI	You will know peace.
NICK FURY	Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.
CLINT BARTON	Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us.
NICK FURY	Like The Pharaohs of Odin.
SELVIG	He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
LOKI	Well, then...
CLINT BARTON	(pointing to the Loki team) Need these vehicles.
CLINT BARTON	He didn't tell me.
NICK FURY	(through the walkie talkie) Hill, do you copy?!
NICK FURY	Barton is...
NICK FURY	He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!	Director? Director Fury, do you copy?
NICK FURY	The Tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
NICK FURY	Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that brief case.	Roger that.
NICK FURY	Coulson, get back to base. This is a LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at war.	What do we do?
LUCHKOV	This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
NATASHA	I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.
LUCHKOV	I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.
NATASHA	I thought General Soholob was in charge of the export business.
LUCHKOV	Soholob? Your reputation is quite a progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW. Nothing but a pretty face.
NATASHA	You really think I'm pretty?
LUCHKOV	We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...	You may have to write it down.
WEASELLY THUG	Ya? (looks at LUCHKOV) It's for you.
LUCHKOV	Who the hell is...
NATASHA	Are you kidding? I'm working!
NATASHA	I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
LUCHKOV	I don't give everything.
NATASHA	Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
NATASHA	Let me put you on hold.
NATASHA	Where's Barton now?
NATASHA	But he's alive.
NATASHA	Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me about as far as he can throw me.
NATASHA	Bozhe moi.
ATTENDING WOMAN	What are doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here!
LITTLE GIRL	I have to see the doctor! It's my father!
BANNER	Calm down. What's wrong?
LITTLE GIRL	My father...
BANNER	Is he like them?
LITTLE GIRL	Please.
BANNER	Should have got paid up front, Banner.
NATASHA	You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle.
BANNER	Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
NATASHA	Then, what is it? Yoga?
BANNER	You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?
NATASHA	Just you and me.
BANNER	And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?
NATASHA	I did.
BANNER	Who are you?
NATASHA	Natasha Romanoff.
BANNER	Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
NATASHA	No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
BANNER	SHIELD. How did they find me?
NATASHA	We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
BANNER	Why?
NATASHA	Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
BANNER	What if I said no?
NATASHA	I'll persuade you.
BANNER	And what if the... other guy says no?
NATASHA	You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
BANNER	I don't always get what I want.
NATASHA	Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
BANNER	Well, those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA	This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
BANNER	What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
NATASHA	Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be.
BANNER	So Fury isn't after the monster?
NATASHA	Not that he's told me.
BANNER	And he tells you everything?
NATASHA	Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
BANNER	He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA	No one's gonna put you in a...
BANNER
BANNER	I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...
NATASHA	Stand down. We're good here.
BANNER	Just you and me?
NICK FURY	You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?
NICK FURY	Not Asgard. Loki.
NICK FURY	Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us.
NICK FURY	PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.
NICK FURY	This isn't about The Avengers.
NICK FURY	I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
NICK FURY	No, it's won by soldiers.
SHIELD SCIENTIST	This guy is still alive!
NICK FURY	Trouble sleeping?
STEVE	I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.
NICK FURY	Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
STEVE	I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.
NICK FURY	We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
STEVE	You here with a mission, sir?
NICK FURY	I am.
STEVE	Trying to get me back in the world?
NICK FURY	Trying to save it.
STEVE	Hydra's secret weapon.
NICK FURY	Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.
STEVE	Who took it from you?
NICK FURY	He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
STEVE	At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
NICK FURY	Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
NICK FURY	Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
STEVE	You should have left it in the ocean.
TONY	You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
PEPPER POTTS	(on the other line) You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
TONY	Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
PEPPER	Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over and it actually works?
TONY	I assume. Light her up.
PEPPER	How does it look?
TONY	Like Christmas, but with more... me.
PEPPER	Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I can do some more tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next billboards.
TONY	Pepper, you're killing me. Remember? Enjoy the moment.
PEPPER	Then get in here and I will.
JARVIS	Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
TONY	I'm not in. I'm actually out.
JARVIS	Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
TONY	Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.
PEPPER	Levels are holding steady... I think.
TONY	Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?
PEPPER	Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
TONY	What do you mean? All this came from you.
PEPPER	No. All this came from that.
TONY	Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.
PEPPER	Twelve percent?
TONY	An argument can be made for fifteen.
PEPPER	Twelve percent? For my baby?
TONY	Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
PEPPER	Oooooh.
TONY	My private elevator...
PEPPER	You mean OUR elevator?
TONY	...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
PEPPER	Not gonna be that subtle.
TONY	I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
PEPPER	On the lease.
TONY	...Call your mom, can you bunk over?
JARVIS	Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten.
TONY	You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
TONY	Then leave it urgently.
TONY	Security breach.	That's on you.
PEPPER	Phil! Come in.
TONY	Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
PEPPER	Come on in, we're celebrating.
TONY	Which is why he can't stay.
STARK)	Soon as possible.
TONY	I don't like being handed things.
PEPPER	That's alright, `cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade.
PEPPER	Thank you.
TONY	Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
PEPPER	Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
TONY	The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
PEPPER	I didn't know that either.
TONY	Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self- obsessed, don't play well with others.
PEPPER	That I did know.
TONY	Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
TONY	You know, I thought we were having a moment.
PEPPER	I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
TONY	How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
PEPPER	What is all of this?
TONY	This is, uh...
TONY	This.
PEPPER	I'm going to take the jet to D.C. tonight.
TONY	Tomorrow.
PEPPER	You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
TONY	Well, what if I didn't?
PEPPER	If you didn't?
TONY	Yeah.
PEPPER	You mean if you finished? (Stark nods his head) Well, um...then...
TONY	Square deal. It's the last date.
PEPPER	Work hard.
PILOT	We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.
STEVE	So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
STEVE	Didn't really go his way, did it?
STEVE	Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
STEVE	The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
THE OTHER	The Chitauri grow restless.
LOKI	Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
THE OTHER	Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
LOKI	Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER	You question us? You question HIM? He, who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?
LOKI	I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed!
THE OTHER	Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
LOKI	You don't have the Tesseract yet.
LOKI	I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.
THE OTHER	You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain.
STEVE	Ma'am?
NATASHA	Hi.	They need you on the bridge. Face time.
NATASHA	There was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
STEVE	Trading cards?
NATASHA	They're vintage, he's very proud.
STEVE	Dr. Banner.
BANNER	Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.
STEVE	Word is you can find the cube.
BANNER	Is that the only word on me?
STEVE	Only word I care about.
BANNER	(takes in the sentiment) Must be strange for you, all of this.
STEVE	Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
NATASHA	Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
STEVE	Is this is a submarine?
BANNER	Really? They wanted me in a submerged pressurized metal container?
BANNER
NICK FURY	Good. Let's vanish.
NICK FURY	Gentlemen.
NICK FURY	Doctor, thank you for coming.
BANNER	Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?
NICK FURY	Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
BANNER	Where are you with that?
NATASHA	That's still not gonna find them in time.
BANNER	You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
NICK FURY	How many are there?
BANNER	Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?
NICK FURY	Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
NATASHA	You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
SELVIG	Put it over there!	Where did you find all these people?
CLINT BARTON	SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor.
CLINT BARTON	Is this the stuff you need?
SELVIG	Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.
CLINT BARTON	Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
SELVIG	Well, I didn't know! (sees Loki coming) Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.
LOKI	I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
CLINT BARTON	My next target.
LOKI	Tell me what you need.
CLINT BARTON	I'll need a distraction. (grabs his bow) And an eyeball.
STEVE	No, no. It's fine.
NICK FURY	Captain, you're up.
LOKI	Kneel before me.
LOKI	I said. KNEEL!!!
LOKI	Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.
LOKI	There are no men like me.
LOKI	Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.
LOKI	The soldier. A man out of time.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	I'm not the one who's out of time.
NATASHA	Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
LOKI	Kneel.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Not today!
NATASHA	The guy's all over the place.
IRON MAN	Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
IRON MAN	Make your move, Reindeer Games.
IRON MAN	Good move.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Mr. Stark.
IRON MAN	Captain.
NATASHA	Not a word.
STEVE	I don't like it.
TONY	What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
STEVE	I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
TONY	Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
STEVE	What?
TONY	It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle.
STEVE	Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
TONY	Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
NATASHA	Where's this coming from?
STEVE	What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
LOKI	I'm not overly fond of what follows.
IRON MAN	Now there's that guy.
NATASHA	Another Asgardian?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Think the guy's a friendly?
IRON MAN	Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Stark, we need a plan of attack!
IRON MAN	I have a plan. Attack.
NATASHA	I'd sit this one out, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	I don't see how I can.
NATASHA	These guys come from legends, they're basically gods.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
THOR	Where is the Tesseract?
LOKI	I missed you too.
THOR	Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
LOKI	Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.
THOR	I thought you dead.
LOKI	Did you mourn?
THOR	We all did. Our father...
LOKI	Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?
THOR	We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?
LOKI	I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!
THOR	So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.
LOKI	And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?
THOR	You think yourself above them.
LOKI	Well, yes.
THOR	Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.
LOKI	I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
THOR	Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
LOKI	I am a king!
THOR	Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
LOKI	I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where.
THOR	You listen well, brother. I...
LOKI	I'm listening.
THOR	Do not touch me again!
TONY	Then don't take my stuff.
THOR	You have no idea what you're dealing with.
TONY	Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
THOR	This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!
TONY	He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist.
TONY	Okay.
JARVIS	Power at 400% capacity.
TONY	How about that?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Hey! That's enough! (comes down; looks at Thor) Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
THOR	I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
IRON MAN	Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
THOR	You want me to put the hammer down?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Are we done here?
NICK FURY	In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass.
NICK FURY	Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?!
NICK FURY	Ant.
NICK FURY	Boot.
LOKI	It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.
NICK FURY	Built for something a lot stronger than you.
LOKI	Oh, I've heard.
LOKI	The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?
NICK FURY	How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control.LOKI	Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.
NICK FURY	Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something.
BANNER	He really grows on you, doesn't he?
STEVE	Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?
THOR	He has an army called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
STEVE	An army? From outer space?

TONY	(walks in with Coulson; to
COULSON)
TONY	No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing. (referring to the Iridium) Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants.	Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did. (covering his eye, looks
AROUND)	How does Fury do this?
TONY	Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
TONY	Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?
STEVE	Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
BANNER	He's got to heat the cube to a hundredand twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
TONY	Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
BANNER	Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
TONY	Finally, someone who speaks English.
STEVE	Is that what just happened?
TONY	It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. You're work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
BANNER	Thanks.
NICK FURY	Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.
STEVE	Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
NICK FURY	I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
THOR	Monkeys? I do not understand.
STEVE	I do! I understood that reference.
TONY	Shall we play, doctor?
BANNER	Let's play some.
BANNER	The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.
TONY	If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
BANNER	All I packed was a tooth brush.
TONY	You know, you should come by STARK TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
BANNER	Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.
TONY	Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.
BANNER
TONY	Nothing?
STEVE	Hey! Are you nuts?
TONY	You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
STEVE	Is everything a joke to you?
TONY	Funny things are.
STEVE	Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, doctor.
BANNER	No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.
TONY	You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.
STEVE	And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
TONY	You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
STEVE	You think Fury's hiding something?
TONY	He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets. (points to Banner) It's bugging him too, isn't it?
BANNER	(bobbling the words) Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...
STEVE	Doctor?
BANNER	'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
STEVE	I heard it.
BANNER	(pointing at Tony) Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
STEVE	The Stark Tower? That big ugly (Tony gives him a look) ...building in New York?
BANNER
TONY
BANNER	(referring to Tony)
TONY
STEVE	(taken by that)
TONY	(holds out a bag of blueberries)
STEVE
TONY
STEVE	I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.
TONY	Following is not really my style.
STEVE	And you're all about style, aren't you?
TONY	(a nerve hit) Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?
BANNER	Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
STEVE	Just find the cube.
TONY	That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
BANNER	The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.
TONY	What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.
TONY	It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.
BANNER	And I'll read all about it.
TONY	Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
BANNER	Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.
TONY	You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart. (points at the MINI-ARC REACTOR in his chest) This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
BANNER	But you can control it.
TONY	Because I learned how.
BANNER	It's different.
TONY	Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
BANNER	So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life?BANNER	That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
TONY	I guess we'll find out.
BANNER	You might not like that.
TONY	You just might.
THOR	Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.
THOR	They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we...we come here battling like BILCHSTEIM.
THOR	BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?
THOR	They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.
THOR	When I first came to earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.	You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
THOR	I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him.
NICK FURY	A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
THOR	What are you asking me to do?
NICK FURY	I'm asking. What are you prepared to do?
THOR	Loki is a prisoner.
NICK FURY	Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
LOKI	There's not many people that can sneak up on me. (turns to see NATASHA
STANDING THERE)
NATASHA	But you figured I'd come.
LOKI	After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.
NATASHA
LOKI
NATASHA
LOKI
NATASHA
LOKINATASHA	(she pulls up a chair as
WELL)
LOKI
NATASHA
LOKINATASHA	Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.
LOKI	What is it you want?
NATASHA	It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
LOKI	Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? S�O PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?	This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!
LOKI	I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim!
NATASHA	You're a monster.
LOKI	No, you brought the monster.
NATASHA	(turns back around; poised) So, Banner... that's your play.
LOKI	What?
NATASHA	Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well.	Thank you for your cooperation.
NICK FURY	What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
TONY	Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
NICK FURY	You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
BANNER	We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
TONY	And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss. (suddenly his monitor show a collection of SECRET FILES) What is PHASE 2?
STEVE	PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.	Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.
NICK FURY	(trying to explain) Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...
TONY	I'm sorry, Nick.
TONY	What were you lying?
STEVE	I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
BANNER	Did you know about this?
NATASHA	You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
BANNER	I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
NATASHA	Loki's manipulating you.
BANNER	And you've been doing what exactly?
NATASHA	You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
BANNER	Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
NICK FURY	Because of him. (pointing at Thor)
THOR	Me?
NICK FURY
THOR
NICK FURY
STEVE
THOR
STEVE
NICK FURY
TONY
NICK FURY
STEVE TONY	I thought humans were more evolved than this.
NICK FURY	Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?
THOR	Did you always give your champions such mistrust?
NATASHA BANNER
TONY STEVE	(to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
BARTON	Arms to ammunition, over.
THOR	You speak of control, yet you court chaos.
BANNER	It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb.
NICK FURY	You need to step away.
TONY	(puts his arm around Steve) Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
STEVE	(pushes Tony off) You know damn well why! Back off!
TONY	(comes face-to-face with Cap) Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
STEVE	Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?
TONY	Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
STEVE	I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.STEVE	The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
TONY	I think I would just cut the wire.
STEVE	Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
TONY	(that did it) A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!
STEVE	Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
THOR	You people are so petty... and tiny.
BANNER	Yeah, this is a tee...
NICK FURY	Agent Romanoff, would you escort Dr.Banner back to his...
BANNER	Where? You rented my room.
NICK FURY	The cell was just in case...
BANNER	In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried!	I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out! So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk!
BANNER	You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
STEVE	Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.
TONY	Got it.
BANNER	Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all.
THOR	Located the Tesseract?
TONY	I can get there faster.
STEVE	Look, all of us...
THOR	The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no human is a match for it.
STEVE	You're not going alone!
TONY	You gonna stop me?
STEVE	Put on the suit, let's find out.
TONY	I'm not afraid to hit an old man.
STEVE	Put on the suit.
BANNER	Oh, my God!
STEVE	Put on the suit!
TONY	Yep!
NICK FURY	Hill?!
GALAGA PLAYER	(points to monitor) Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but it's impossible to get out there and make repairs while we're in the air.
NICK FURY	Stark! You copy that?!
NICK FURY	Coulson! Initiate official lock down in the detention section then get to the armory! Move out!
NATASHA	(quietly, to herself) I'm okay. We're okay, right?
BARTON	Get that engine down! Detention! Get him through the dark! Come with me.
TONY	Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
NATASHA	Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it. This is just what Loki wants. We're gonna be okay. Listen to me.
NATASHA	We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on my life I will get you out of this, you will walk away, and never...
BANNER	Your life?
NATASHA	Bruce.
NICK FURY	Bring the carrier inwards and head south. Take us to the water.
HELMSMAN	Why water? Navigations recalibrated after the engine failure.
NICK FURY	Is the sun coming up?!
HELMSMAN	Yes, sir.
NICK FURY	Then put it on the left! Get us over water! One more turbine goes down and we drop.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Stark, I'm here!
TONY	Good. See what we got.
TONY	I gotta get this super conducting cooling system back online before I can access the rotors and work on dislodging the debris.
IRON MAN	I need you to get to that engine control panel and tell me which relays are in overload position.
IRON MAN	What's it look like in there?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	It seems to run on some form of electricity.
IRON MAN	Well, you're not wrong.
THOR	We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to think!
TONY	Even if I clear the rotors, this thing won't re-engage without a jump. I'm gonna have to get in there and push.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Well if that thing gets up to speed, you'll get shredded!
TONY	Then stay in the control unit and reverse polarity long enough to disengage mag...
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Speak English!
TONY	See that red lever? It'll slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
NICK FURY	We need a full evac on the lower hangar bay.
NICK FURY	Get his attention.
ESCORT 606 PILOT	Target acquired. Target engaged. (pulls the trigger; fires guns at HULK)
ESCORT 606 PILOT
NICK FURY	They are not getting through here, so what the hell...
NICK FURY	It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy?
NATASHA	This is Agent Romanoff. I copy.
IRON MAN	Yeah. Noticed.
THOR
LOKI	Are you ever not going to fall for that?
LOKI	(smiles; walks over to the
CONTROL PANEL)	The humans think us immortal. Should we test that?
THOR	Nooo!
BARTON	Natasha...
LOKI	Am I?
LOKI	Your heroes are scattered, your floating fortress falls from the sky...where is my disadvantage?
LOKI	I don't think I...
TONY	Cap, I need the lever!
TONY	Lever. Now!
NICK FURY	Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!
NICK FURY	Not an option.
NICK FURY	These were in Phil Coulson's jacket. Guess he never did get you to sign them.
NICK FURY	We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you. Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that coming.	Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.
NICK FURY	Well, it's an old fashioned notion.
SECURITY GUARD	You fell out of the sky.
BANNER	Did I hurt anybody?
SECURITY GUARD	There's nobody around here to get hurt. You did scare the hell out of some pigeons though.
BANNER	Lucky.
SECURITY GUARD	Or just good aim. You were awake when you fell.
BANNER	You saw?
SECURITY GUARD	The whole thing, right through the ceiling. Big and green and buck ass nude. Here...
SECURITY GUARD	I didn't think those would fit you until you shrunk down to a regular size fella.
BANNER	Thank you.
SECURITY GUARD	Are you an alien?
BANNER	What?
SECURITY GUARD	From outer space, an alien?
BANNER	No.
SECURITY GUARD	Well then, son, you've got a condition.
NATASHA	Clint, you're gonna be alright.
CLINT BARTON	You know that? Is that what you know? I got...I gotta go in though. I gotta flush him out.
NATASHA	We don't have that long, it's gonna take time.
CLINT BARTON	I don't understand. Have you ever had someone take your brain and play? Pull you out and send something else in? Do you know what it's like to be unmade?
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON	(Natasha unfastens the
RESTRAINTS)
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON
NATASHA
CLINT BARTON	But you don't. You're a spy, not a soldier. Now you want to wade into a war. Why? What did Loki do to you?
NATASHA	He didn't, I just...CLINT BARTON	Natasha.
NATASHA	I've been compromised. I got red in my ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.
STEVE	Was he married?
TONY	No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.
STEVE	I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.
TONY	He was an idiot.
STEVE	Why? For believing?
TONY	For taking on Loki alone.
STEVE	He was doing his job.
TONY	He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have...
STEVE
TONYSTEVE
TONY	(turns around sharply)
STEVE
TONY	(looking at the blood stained
WALL)
STEVE
TONY
STEVE
TONY
STEVE	Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.
TONY	Yeah. That's just a preview, this is opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva. He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered...	Sonofabitch!
STEVE	Time to go.
NATASHA	Go where?
STEVE	I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly one of those jets?
CLINT BARTON	I can.
STEVE	You got a suit?
CLINT BARTON	Yeah.
STEVE	Then suit up.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Son... just don't.
NICK FURY	Agent Hill?
NICK FURY	They needed the push. (holding Coulson's cards)
NICK FURY	They found it. Get our communications back up, whatever you have to do. I want eyes on everything.
JARVIS	Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The device is already self-sustained.
TONY	Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.
SELVIG	It's too late! It can't stop now. He wants to show us something! A new universe.
IRON MAN	Okay.
JARVIS	The barrier is pure energy. It's unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready to be deployed.
TONY	Skip the spinning rims. We're on the clock.
LOKI	Please tell me you're going to appeal to my humanity.
TONY	Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten you.
LOKI	You should have left your armor on for that.
TONY	Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage. You've got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?
LOKI	Stalling me won't change anything.
TONY	No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.
LOKI	The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?
TONY
LOKI	Yes, I've met them.
TONY	Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one.
TONY	But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demi-God; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
LOKI	That was the plan.
TONY	Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
LOKI	I have an army.
TONY	We have a HULK.
LOKI	I thought the beast had wandered off.
TONY	You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
LOKI	(slowly walks up to him; raising the scepter) How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you?
LOKI	It should work.
TONY	Well, performance issues. You know?
TONY	Jarvis. Anytime now.
LOKI	You will all fall before me.
IRON MAN	And there's one other person you pissed off! His name was Phil.
TONY	Right. Army.
THOR	Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll destroy it!
LOKI	You can't. There is no stopping it. There is only the war!
THOR	So be it.
IRON MAN	What, did you stop for drive-thru? Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you.
JARVIS	Sir, we have more incoming.
TONY	Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
HAWKEYE	Yeah.
BLACK WIDOW	See them.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Stark, are you seeing this?
TONY	I'm seeing, still working on believing. Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?
TONY	Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a soft spot.
THOR	Look at this! Look around you! You think this madness will end with your rule?
LOKI	(tries to look away) It's too late. It's too late to stopit.
THOR	No. We can. Together.
LOKI	Sentiment.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Those people need assistance down there.
BLACK WIDOW	We got this. It's good. Go!
CAPTAIN AMERICA	You think you can hold them off?
HAWKEYE	Captain. (pulls a trigger on his bow; a narrow is mechanically
CHOSEN)	It would be my genuine pleasure.
BLACK WIDOW	Just like BUDAPEST all over again!
HAWKEYE	You and I remember Budapest verydifferently.
YOUNG COP	We need to get out! They gotta bring the National Guard!
POLICE SERGEANT	National Guard? Does the army know what's happening here?
YOUNG COP	Do we?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
POLICE SERGEANT	Why the hell should I take orders from you?
POLICE SERGEANT	I need men in those buildings, lead the people down and away from the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.
IRON MAN	We got his attention. What the hell is step two?!
CAPTAIN AMERICA	What's the story upstairs?
THOR	The powers surrounding the cube is impenetrable.
BLACK WIDOW	How do we do this?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	As a team.
THOR	I have unfinished business with Loki.
HAWKEYE	Yeah, get in line.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us...
BANNER	So, this all seems horrible.
BLACK WIDOW	I've seen worse.
BANNER	Sorry.
BLACK WIDOW	No. We could use a little worse.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Stark? We got him.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Just like you said.
TONY	Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing the party to you.
BLACK WIDOW	I... I don't see how that's a party...
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good time for you to get angry.
BANNER	That's my secret, Captain. I'm always angry.
LOKI	Send the rest.
BLACK WIDOW	Guys.
IRON MAN	Call it, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Alright, listen up. Until we can close that portal up there, we're gonna use containment. Barton, I want you on that roof, eyes on everything. Call out patterns and strays. Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
HAWKEYE	Wanna give me a lift?
IRON MAN	Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You've got the lightning. Light the bastards up. (Thor flies up; to Natasha) You and me, we stay here on the ground, keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.
HAWKEYE	Stark. You got a lot of strings sticking to your tail.
IRON MAN	Just try and keep them off the streets.
HAWKEYE	Well, they can't bank worth a damn. Find a tight corner.
IRON MAN	I will roger that.
TONY	Nice call. What else you got?
TONY	And he didn't invite me?
BLACK WIDOW	Captain, none of this is gonna mean a damn thing if we don't close that portal.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.
BLACK WIDOW	Well, maybe it's not about guns. (gestures the flying
CHARIOTS)
CAPTAIN AMERICA	You wanna get up there, you're gonna need a ride.
BLACK WIDOW	I got a ride. I could use a lift though.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Are you sure about this?
BLACK WIDOW	Yeah. It's gonna be fun.
HAWKEYE	Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON, they caught a lot of civilians there.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	I'm on it.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Everyone! Clear out!
NICK FURY	I recognize the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.
NICK FURY	That is the island of Manhattan, Councilman. Until I'm certain my team can't hold it, I will not order a nuclear strike against a civilian population.
NICK FURY	I send that bird out, we already have.
BLACK WIDOW	Oh. You.
HAWKEYE	Nat, what are you doing?
HAWKEYE	I've got him.
LOKI
HULK
BLACK WIDOW	Doctor.
SELVIG	Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
BLACK WIDOW	It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
SELVIG	Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source.
BLACK WIDOW	Loki's scepter.
SELVIG	It might be able to close the portal. (Selvig looks down. He sees a
GOLD GLEAM)	And I'm looking right at it.
JARVIS	Sir, we will lose power before you cut through that shell.
IRON MAN	JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of Jonah?
JARVIS	I wouldn't consider him a role model.
7 ALPHA 11 PILOT	7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to takeoff.
NICK FURY	Stark, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city.
NICK FURY	Three minutes, at best. Stay low and wipe out the missile.
IRON MAN	Jarvis, put everything we got into the thrusters!
JARVIS	I just did.
7 ALPHA 11	Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds mark.
THOR	You ready for another bout?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	What? You gettin' sleepy?
BLACK WIDOW	I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down!
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Do it!
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Stark, these things are still coming!
TONY	I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.
TONY	Save the rest for return, J.
JARVIS	Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?
IRON MAN	You might as well.
BLACK WIDOW	Come on, Stark...
CAPTAIN AMERICA	(to BLACK WIDOW) Close it.
CAPTAIN AMERICA	Son of a gun!
THOR	He's not slowing down.
TONY	What the hell? What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me?
CAPTAIN AMERICA	We won.
TONY	Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.
THOR	(looking up at Stark Tower) We're not finished yet.
TONY	And then shawarma after.
LOKI	If it's all the same to you. I'll have that drink.
SENATOR BOYNTON	These so called heroes have to be held responsible for the destruction done to the city. This was their fight. Where are they now?
WAITRESS	What? That this was somehow their fault? Captain America saved my life. Wherever he is, wherever any of them are, I just wanna say thank you.
NICK FURY	I'm not currently tracking their whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a leave of absence.
NICK FURY	The Tesseract is where it belongs: out of our reach.
NICK FURY	I didn't make it. I just didn't argue with the god that did.
NICK FURY	Oh, I think he will be.
NICK FURY	They surely are. And the whole world knows it. Every world knows it.
NICK FURY	A promise.
NICK FURY	They'll come back.
NICK FURY	I am.
NICK FURY	Because we'll need them to.
