Moonrise Kingdom

NARRATOR	This is the island of New Penzance. Sixteen miles long. Forested with old- growth pine and maple. Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks. An important seabird habitat. There are no paved roads but instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove. The year is 1965. We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound, famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September -- in three day's time.
GADGE	Morning, sir.
ROOSEVELT	I don't know. I think I skipped a stitch.
SKOTAK	We're building a tree house.
SKOTAK	Well, where would you've built it?	Lower!
PANAGLE	Sixteen and a half.	That enough for the Jubilee?
REDFORD	Safety-test, sir.	Come again?
REDFORD	The vehicle appears to be in good working order. I'm just checking if --	Reckless cycling. Second warning. Next time, I take away the keys.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Watch my line, Edgar.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Morning, Randy. What can I do for you? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP	What does that mean? Over.	9.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Any idea why? Over.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
BECKY	Hello, Diane.
BECKY	Hold the line, please.
BECKY	Go ahead, Chesterfield.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
CAPTAIN SHARP	There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll find him. We're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I'm confused by that statement. You can't invite him back?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Am I speaking to Sam's father?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a matter of protocol. You say you can't invite him back? You say he's an orphan? Well, I don't understand how that works.	What am I supposed to do with him?
LAZY-EYE	What's your real job, sir?	I'm a math teacher.
LAZY-EYE	What grade?	Eighth. Why?
REDFORD	What if he resists?	Who?
REDFORD	Shakusky. Are we allowed to use force on him?	No, you're not. This is a non-violent rescue effort. Your instructions are to find him, not to hurt him. Under any circumstances. Do I make myself understood?
SKOTAK	Right here.
LAZY-EYE	I heard he ran away because his family died.
GADGE	I heard he never had any family in the first place.
DELUCA	That's probably why he's crazy.
REDFORD	I'll tell you one thing: if we find him, I'm not going to be the one who forgot to bring a weapon.
NICKLEBY	Me, neither.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Most likely not.	I disagree, Counsellor. It'd take him three days, at least.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Be that as it may, will you let me know if you see anything unusual?

SAM	What kind of bird are you?
BOSSY GIRL	I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
SAM	No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
SUZY	I'm a raven.
BOSSY GIRL	Boy's aren't allowed in here.
SAM	I'll be leaving soon.
SAM	What happened to your hand?
SUZY	I got hit in the mirror.
SAM	Really. How'd that happen?
SUZY	I lost my temper at myself.
SUZY	What's your name?
SAM	Sam. What's yours?
SUZY	I'm Suzy.
BOSSY GIRL	It's not polite to stare.
SKINNY GIRL	He likes you.
SAM	Were you followed?
SUZY	I doubt it.
SAM	Good.
SAM	Did you bring a cat?
SAM	Can you read a map?
SUZY	Uh-huh.
SAM	I do cartography.
SAM	I feel we should go halfway today and halfway tomorrow, since you're a less experienced hiker, and you're wearing Sunday-school shoes.
SUZY	OK.
SAM	(pointing on the map) Here's where we are right now. I'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred (which means four o'clock). How does that sound?
SUZY	Fine.
SAM	You want some beef jerky?
SUZY	OK.
SAM	Let's go.
SAM	Are you thirsty?
SUZY	No.
SAM	Well, if your throat gets parched, stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it. You can quench your thirst with the spit, supposedly.
SAM	Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It cools your head down.
SUZY	That's a good idea. It might help also if you didn't wear fur.
SAM	True, but this adds camouflage.
SAM	Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air, and you can see which direction the wind's blowing.
SUZY	Which way?
SAM	Unknown. I guess it doesn't really matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
SAM	These might be poisonous.
SUZY	No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try one.
SAM	Not bad. Anyway, they're good for survival.
SUZY	He knows someone's watching him.
SAM	I agree. Why do you say that?
SUZY	I don't know. I just think he can feel us.
SAM	You smell like perfume.
SUZY	It's my mother's.
SAM	I brought water, too.
SAM	Should we catch him?
SUZY	What for?
SAM	Trout bait. We need worms.
SUZY	No.
SAM	You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe I've got a licorice whip.
SAM	How strong of a swimmer are you?
SUZY	Pretty good. I broke our school record for the back-stroke.
SAM	OK. Well, I'm not that strong of a swimmer, so I wear a life-preserver. I think it's a good policy to get in the habit, anyway.
SUZY	OK.
SAM	Watch out for turtles. They'll bite you, if you put your fingers in their mouths. Let me see if I can catch this one.
SAM	Somebody wrote on him.
SUZY	The stick's moving!
SAM	You got one!
SAM	Fish on hook!	Reel him in! Slowly.
SUZY	Sit down!
SAM	You're doing good.
SAM	This is for fishing.
SUZY	Very good. You know a lot about camping, don't you?
SAM	I'm a Khaki Scout. It's what I'm trained for.
SAM	Anyway, I used to be.
SAM	We can feed your cat the guts and eyeballs.
SUZY	That's OK. He only eats cat food.
SAM	What else did you bring? We should make an inventory.
SUZY	OK.
SAM	Go ahead.
SUZY	This is my record player. It works with batteries. Actually, it belongs to my little brother Lionel. I left him a note. Do you like music?
SUZY	This is my favorite record album. My godmother gave it to me for my birthday. She lives in France.
SUZY	These are my books. I like stories with magic powers in them. Either in kingdoms on earth or on foreign planets. Also, time-travel, if they make it realistic. Usually, I prefer a girl hero, but not always. I couldn't bring all of them because it got too heavy. You can borrow any you want.
SUZY	I also brought my lefty scissors because I'm left-handed, my toothbrush, some rubber bands, extra batteries, and my binoculars, as you know. I forgot my comb.
SAM	That's it? No mess-kit? No flashlight? No canteen? No waterproof matches? Didn't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter?
SUZY	I thought that's what you're supposed to bring. I don't own a canteen.
SAM	That's OK. We can share.
SAM	These are all library books. In my school you're only allowed to check-out one at a time. Some of these are going to be overdue.
SAM	Do you steal?
SAM	Why? You're not poor.
SUZY	I might turn some of them back in one day. I haven't decided yet. I know it's bad. I think I just took them to have a secret to keep. Anyway, for some reason, it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes.
SAM	Are you depressed?
SAM	How come?
SUZY	Well, I can show you an example, if you want -- but it doesn't make me feel very good. I found this on top of our refrigerator.
SAM	Does that mean you?
SUZY	It's not funny.
SAM	To me, it is.
SUZY	You really know how to make friends.
SAM	I'm sorry.
SUZY	That's OK.
SAM	I'm on your side.
SUZY	I know.
SAM	Which one's the best?
SUZY	His eyes downcast, his kingdom in ruins, Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the rippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor. "My people once were lead by a great and noble beast -- and I no longer see his face in this reflection."
SUZY	Meanwhile, on the Plains of Tabitha, Francine rested. There would be another time for war.
LIONEL	I don't know, but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking.	What does that mean?	That's a loaded question.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
JUST --	What are you doing here? Nobody called the police.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I know, that's what I'm saying. The search party's not over yet. In other
WORDS --
CAPTAIN SHARP	OK. Where'd she --
CAPTAIN SHARP	I don't know, but just for the record: ninety-five percent of all runaways return home within six hours. That doesn't do you any good right now. It's just a statistic -- but in all likelihood Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment, as we speak.
CAPTAIN SHARP	How's Laura?	How's Laura?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Is she upset?
CAPTAIN SHARP	I got to get this spot-light fixed.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Sam Shakusky. That's my escaped Khaki Scout. His family died.
CAPTAIN SHARP	What does he say?
BECKY	I'm not sure. I think he went searching in the dark.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I think he's onto us.	Of course, he is.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Of course, he is?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Why aren't we worried about that, then?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Well, I didn't know. Or, anyway, I thought I was wrong. Did you hit him?
NICKLEBY	Cat food! I think it's a clue.
CAPTAIN SHARP	All right. We know they're together. We know they're within a certain radius of this spot. I'm declaring the case with the county right now. Until help arrives:
CAPTAIN SHARP	I'm deputizing the little guy, the skinny one, and the kid with the curly hair to come with me in the station wagon. Randy, you drop-in and head up-river with the rest of your troop, then split-up on foot. Becky, call Jed and tell him to circle over this end of the island and fly low.
SUZY	They found the canoe.
SAM	(angry at himself) Rats! I should've put more pine needles on it. Let's go. We're almost there.
SAM	What do you creeps want?
REDFORD	We're looking for you.
SAM	Why?
REDFORD	Because you're a fugitive.
SAM	No, I'm not. Didn't you get my letter of resignation? I quit the Khaki Scouts.
REDFORD	You're still in uniform.
REDFORD	Well, it doesn't matter, anyway. You don't have that authority. We've been deputized. Now are you going to come along peacefully or not?
SAM	Listen to some reason: I don't like you. You don't like me. Why don't you stupid idiots just let us disappear?
REDFORD	It's tempting, but I can't allow it.
DELUCA	You shouldn't be friends with him.
SUZY	Why not?
DELUCA	Because he's crazy.
SUZY	Maybe you just don't know him.
REDFORD	We know him a lot better than you. He's emotionally disturbed because his family died. Nickleby, tie him up.
SAM	Do not cross this stick.
REDFORD	You're doomed, Shakusky.
SAM	It was him or us.
SUZY	Oh, no.
SAM	They got Snoopy through the neck.
SUZY	He needs a doctor.
SAM	No, he doesn't. He needs a morgue.
SUZY	(trying to catch her breath) He's losing blood. Hurry. Where do we go?
SAM	Suzy. Look at me. Snoopy's not going to make it.
SUZY	(starting to cry) Don't say that.
SAM	They're after us. We got to move.
SUZY	(raising her voice) He's dying! We can't just leave him!
SAM	It's too late! He's already gone!
SUZY	Stop yelling at me!
SAM	I'm sorry I had to do that, but you're panicking. The first rule in any emergency is you never --
SUZY	Don't ever do that again. No one's allowed to slap me.
SUZY	You're right. He's dead.
SUZY	Was he a good dog?
SAM	Who's to say -- but he didn't deserve to die.
LAZY-EYE	She stabbed Redford in the back with lefty scissors!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit!
NICKLEBY	I tried to chop him, but he dodged my tomahawk.
PANAGLE	Who else got hit?
IZOD	Not me. I ran away when the girl went berserk.
SKOTAK	He's got great marksmanship. He shot Deluca in both arms.
GADGE	Where's Snoopy?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Clear the dock, Edgar!
GADGE	No, she's in the woods with Shakusky.
JED	Where'm I going?
CAPTAIN SHARP	The infirmary at Fort Lebanon. We'll be right behind you.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Warm up the motor. I'll be right back.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Walt, it's very clear: the two of them conspired in this together.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Stop.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I do blame him -- (pointing to Scout Master Ward) -- but I also blame myself and both of you. With all due respect: you can't let your children stab people.	What are you talking about?	Well, I am!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Easy does it. Calm down, Laura.
NARRATOR	As some of you know, I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch. He's a smart boy, and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island's indigenous peoples. In particular, I recall his fascination with the idea of retracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration.
NARRATOR	What I'm getting at is this: I think I know where they're going.
SUZY	This is weird.
SAM	I know!
SAM	On three!
SUZY	I like it here, but I don't like the name.
SAM	Me, neither.
SUZY	Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. It's got no ring to it.
SAM	Let's change it. What should it be?
SUZY	Let me think for a minute.
SAM	I made you some jewelry.
SAM	Are your ears pierced?
SUZY	It's pretty. Do the other one.
SUZY	It feels hard.
SAM	Do you mind?
SUZY	I like it.
SAM	Tilt your head sideways.
SUZY	You can touch my chest.
SUZY	They're going to grow more.
SAM	Why do you always use binoculars?
SUZY	It helps me see things closer. Even if they're not very far away. I pretend it's my magic power.
SAM	That sounds like poetry. Poems don't always have to rhyme, you know. They're just supposed to be creative.
SAM	What do you want to be? When you grow up.
SUZY	I don't know. I want to go on adventures, I think. Not get stuck in one place. How about you?
SAM	Go on adventures, too. Not get stuck, too. I guess that sounds almost like I'm just repeating what you just said, but I couldn't think of anything as good as it. On the other hand, maybe we'll get blown up by an atom bomb. You can't predict the exact future.
SUZY	That's true.
SAM	It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way. Later, I mean.
SUZY	OK.
SAM	I wish I didn't have to mention it, but just in case. I don't want to make you be offended.
SUZY	Of course, I won't.
SAM	Some people frown on these problems.
SUZY	What's that one for?
SAM	It's not an accomplishment. I inherited it from my mother. It's actually not meant for a male to wear -- but I don't give a damn.
SUZY	Are your foster parents still mad at you? For getting in trouble so much.
SAM	I don't think so. We're getting to know each other better. I feel like I'm in a family now. Not like yours, but similar to one.
SUZY	I always wished I was an orphan. Most of my favorite characters are. I think your lives are more special.
SAM	I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about.
SUZY	I love you, too.
SUZY	The flashlight's beam drew a moon through the black across the attic and settled on a gap in the base-board. A mouse-hole, no bigger than a pocket-watch. Eric crouched on his flat feet and placed his hand in front of the tiny opening. "It's windy," he said. "Like someone in there's blowing on my fingers." Christy rolled her eyes and sighed a sigh. He's right again, she thought. Little brothers drive people crazy.
SUZY	Part Two.
SKOTAK	How long were you planning to stay there?
SAM	I don't know.
MURRAY	You said ten days or less.
SUZY	That was a lie.
GADGE	Didn't you ever think about what would happen next?
SAM	Not to my recollection.
LIONEL	You're a traitor to our family.
SUZY	Good. I want to be.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Give him his mail.
SUZY	What does it say?
SAM	They can't invite me back.
SUZY	Why not?
SAM	I gave them too much aggravation.
SUZY	Let me read it.
SUZY	That's child abuse.
SUZY	I'd be careful if I were you. One of these days somebody's going to be pushed too far, and who knows what they're capable of.	Is that a threat?
SUZY	It's a warning.
SUZY	I wish I knew what makes you tick.	I beg your pardon?	She's saying that to me?
BECKY	Judy, I have your person-to-person from New Penzance.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Hello? This is Captain Sharp.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand he's in your custody.
CAPTAIN SHARP	That's correct.
SOCIAL SERVICES	What's his condition? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind?
CAPTAIN SHARP	He's OK.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Very good. How do I get to you?
CAPTAIN SHARP	The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can bring you in with the mail.
SOCIAL SERVICES	I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's acceptable to you. Is someone able to	60.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Is that a yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Very good. I'll contact you again before the end of the day.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Wait a second.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Social Services?
SOCIAL SERVICES	Captain Sharp.
CAPTAIN SHARP	What's going to happen to him?
SOCIAL SERVICES	Well, normally, we'd try to place him in another foster home, but that option is no longer available to us, in my opinion, with his case history -- which means he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Who's speaking?
SOCIAL SERVICES	Right. An orphanage -- but the first step is the admissions panel requires a psychological evaluation to determine whether or not the boy's a candidate for institutional treatment or electroshock therapy. Beyond that --
CAPTAIN SHARP	Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that be necessary? He's not violent.
SOCIAL SERVICES	The report describes an assault with scissors.
CAPTAIN SHARP	That was the girl! Who did that.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but that's not our job. OK?
CAPTAIN SHARP	OK.	-- and why is it still happening? We women are more emotional. You have to
REMEMBER --
SUZY	I hate you.	Don't say "hate".
SUZY	Why not? I mean it.
SUZY	Exactly.	I know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. You go to bed with him.
SUZY	We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that?
SAM	I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That part's true. We knew people would be worried, and we still ran away, anyway -- but something also happened which we didn't do on purpose. When we first met each other. Something happened to us.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I agree with you. That's eloquent. I can't argue against anything you're saying -- but I don't have to, because you're twelve years old.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Look, let's face it, you're probably a much more intelligent person than I am. In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart kids sometimes stick their fingers in electrical sockets, if you see what I mean. It takes time to figure things out. It's been proven by history: all mankind makes mistakes. It's our job to try to protect you from the dangerous ones. If we can.
CAPTAIN SHARP	You want a slug?
CAPTAIN SHARP	What's the rush? You've got your whole life in front of yourself. Ahead of you, I mean.
SAM	Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
CAPTAIN SHARP	What does that have to do with it? So are you.
SAM	That's true. Did you love someone ever?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Yes, I did.
SAM	What happened?
CAPTAIN SHARP	She didn't love me back.
SAM	Ah.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's what people say.
SAM	Thanks.
CAPTAIN SHARP	What happened?
SAM	A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Good grief.
GADGE	I heard he's going to reform school.
DELUCA	I heard they're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum.
ROOSEVELT	I like his girl.
PANAGLE	She's too scruffy for me.
NICKLEBY	Supposedly, they got to third base.
LAZY-EYE	That's not true. He just felt her up.
ROOSEVELT	Over-shirt or under-shirt?
SKOTAK	Damn us.
SKOTAK	This troop has been very shabby to Field Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's	67.
SKOTAK	emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
SKOTAK	Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye? (from the heart) Gadge?
SKOTAK	He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs our help. Are we man enough to give that? So part of his brain doesn't get removed out of him.
SKOTAK	They were prepared to die for each other out there.
DELUCA	What do you need?
SKOTAK	For starters? Three yards of chicken wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a bucket of wheatpaste.
CAPTAIN SHARP	In other words, it's over.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Until further notice.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I understand.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Except me.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Well, I hope you can. I think you will. You're doing the right thing.
CAPTAIN SHARP	No, you won't.
CAPTAIN SHARP	I admire them, you know? There's a purity to it. I only feel bad because they both seem like such unhappy, lonely, miserable people -- but maybe that's romantic.	I don't see it that way.
SAM	Get out of my chimney.
SKOTAK	Listen to me. We're here for friendship. We're going to get you off this island.
SAM	No, thanks.
SKOTAK	Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
SAM	It's worthless to me. There's no point. Not without Suzy.
SAM	How'd you get here?
SUZY	They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-mach� dummy in my bed.
SAM	Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
SAM	Did you leave another note for Lionel?
SUZY	Not this time. He can't keep his trap shut. Besides, I'll probably never see him again.
SAM	That's true.
NARRATOR	This is the island of St. Jack Wood, extending far north from Land's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock. A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above. A small but prosperous community.
NARRATOR	The barometer reads twenty-seven inches and dropping. Strong winds, as you can see, already at twenty-two knots. (checks his watch) The time is now four thirty-five A.M.	Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.	Half of those were self-inflicted.	Stop feeling sorry for yourself.	Why?
SUZY	"-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good, and this time I won't get caught." Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the roots, caught up in the wind and danced. Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and be ready at midnight."
SUZY	He leapt out the window and landed in the fresh-fallen snow.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	You're not going to believe this one, sir. That Scout Master on New Penzance? Has now lost his entire troop.
COMMANDER PIERCE	Well, I'll be damned. Who is this bimbo?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	I couldn't say.
GUARD SCOUT	Who's your unit leader?
NICKLEBY	That guy.
SKOTAK	There's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent.
COUSIN BEN	I don't care how they do it where you come from. You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake-bite kit? Get some money.
COUSIN BEN	Come back in five minutes.
COUSIN BEN	Is this him?
SAM	Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned.
COUSIN BEN	He's hot. Almost too hot. What's in the can?
SKOTAK	Seventy-six dollars -- but it's mostly in nickels.
COUSIN BEN	Give it to me.
COUSIN BEN	You badge in seamanship?
SAM	Yes, sir.
COUSIN BEN	Good. There's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock. The skipper owes me an I.O.U. We'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker. It won't be an easy life, but it's better than shock therapy.
SAM	Thank you, sir. By the way, where's the chapel tent?
COUSIN BEN	Back there, but the padre's home with the mumps. Why do you ask?
SAM	I want to bring my wife.
SUZY	But we're not married yet.
COUSIN BEN	You his girl?
COUSIN BEN	Technically, I'm a civil-law scrivener. I'm authorized to declare births, deaths, and marriages. You're kind of young. You got a license?
COUSIN BEN	I can't offer you a legally binding union. It won't hold up in the state, the county, or, frankly, any courtroom in the world due to your age, lack of a license, and failure to get parental consent -- but the ritual does carry a very important moral weight within yourselves. You can't enter into this lightly. Do you love each other?
COUSIN BEN	Are you sure you're ready for this?
COUSIN BEN	Let me rephrase it.
SUZY	We're in a hurry.
COUSIN BEN	Spit out the gum, sister. In fact, everybody.
COUSIN BEN	I don't like the snappy attitude. This is the most important decision you've made in your lives. Now go over by that trampoline and talk it through before you give me another quick answer.
SAM	I guess we better try to pretend we're struggling over our decision for a minute before we go back over there and tell him --
SUZY	Maybe he's right. It could be a mistake.
SAM	What? Why? How?
SUZY	Being married. Sometimes it seems sad to me. It might be better to just go steady permanently.
SAM	I don't know what to say.
COUSIN BEN	I guess they're probably just trying to pretend they're struggling over their decision, but at least --
SKOTAK	Woah!
SUZY	We're sure.
COUSIN BEN	OK. Let's do a blood test.
COUSIN BEN	-- which we hereby consecrate on this day, the fifth of September, 1965.	That's the end of the short-form. Do any of the witnesses have objections or remarks? Usually, they don't.
COUSIN BEN	Skotak.
SKOTAK	Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried about their future.
COUSIN BEN	That's my fee.
NICKLEBY	What's going to happen to them?
GADGE	Nobody knows.
DELUCA	Let's take a vote.
SKOTAK	All in favor --
COUSIN BEN	That's my fee.
COUSIN BEN	You're just like your brothers. OK, give them the tennis ball can.
COUSIN BEN	Sign here -- and initial here and here.
COUSIN BEN	Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's go.
NICKLEBY	Where they going again?
GADGE	He's going to work on a shrimper, if I understand correctly.
SKOTAK	I wish them well.
LAZY-EYE	Me, too. Me, too.
ROOSEVELT	I think they're coming back.
COUSIN BEN	Be quick, sailor!
SKOTAK	What happened?
SAM	She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent.
DELUCA	Just leave them.
SAM	We can't. It's her magic power!
SAM	You killed your dog, by the way.
REDFORD	Snoopy?	Well, it couldn't be helped.
SAM	Why do you consider me your enemy?
REDFORD	Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the back with lefty scissors.
SAM	She's my wife now.
REDFORD	Congratulations.
SAM	I'm saying before that. Six weeks ago. From day one. What'd I do wrong? I'm trying to understand.	Why don't you like me?
REDFORD	Why should I? Nobody else does.
REDFORD	He's here! The fugitive! Stop him!
SAM	I'm OK.
SAM	Follow me!

COMMANDER PIERCE	Attention, company! Prepare for --
COMMANDER PIERCE	Who's that?
COMMANDER PIERCE	You call yourself a Khaki Scout?	I'm sorry, sir?
COMMANDER PIERCE	Where's your goddamn troop? They could get killed out there!	You don't have them?
COMMANDER PIERCE	You're a liability to us.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	The incident may affect our insurance premiums.
COMMANDER PIERCE	I'm field-stripping you of your command.
COMMANDER PIERCE	Attention, company! Prepare for emergency evacuation!
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	Sir, do you have your medicine?
COMMANDER PIERCE	I'll be right back.
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	All accounted for, Scout Master!
COUSIN BEN	Affirmative, sir!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Who's in charge here?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Randy! What happened?
BECKY	Are you all right?	Of course, I am. Come on.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Where's the boy?
CAPTAIN SHARP	We don't know yet.
SOCIAL SERVICES	That's not acceptable.
CAPTAIN SHARP	(pretending to be irritated) What do you want me to say, lady? (to no one in particular) Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
SOCIAL SERVICES	You're Captain Sharp?
CAPTAIN SHARP	That's right.
SOCIAL SERVICES	I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy to your personal custody. You're responsible for his safety. I'm told he was just struck by lightning.
CAPTAIN SHARP	That's the first I heard of it.	It's true.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Scout Master Ward, I presume?
SOCIAL SERVICES	Your reputation precedes you.
SOCIAL SERVICES	You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to
ENCOUNTER --	-- in a twenty-seven year career!
SOCIAL SERVICES	What do you have to say for yourselves?
CAPTAIN SHARP	You can't do this. They'll eat him alive in there.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Where?
CAPTAIN SHARP	(aside, to Scout Master Ward) What's the name of the place again?	Juvenile refuge?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Just find the boy -- and deliver him -- (motioning to herself) -- to Social Services. Nothing else is in your power.	I'm sorry.	Suzy's still out there.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Who are you?
SOCIAL SERVICES	The parents of the stabber?
COMMANDER PIERCE	I want the details. Where's the scout she knifed?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	Right here.
REDFORD	Field Mate Redford, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE	(through the oxygen mask) What's his condition?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE	He may suffer some limited chronic kidney insufficiency. Here's the report.
SOCIAL SERVICES	Let's go!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Nobody's going anywhere.
CAPTAIN SHARP	He's not getting shock therapy.
SOCIAL SERVICES	That's it! I'm citing you for gross misconduct! You are hereby summoned to appear before the board of --
CAPTAIN SHARP	I'm writing you up back! Be notified that you stand accused of the mistreatment and
IMPROPER --
SOCIAL SERVICES	What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN SHARP	I won't let you do it!
REDFORD	Look!
CAPTAIN SHARP	They're gone.	Who?	Suzy?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Sam?	Gadge! Lazy-eye! Skotak!
SOCIAL SERVICES	They're here?
CAPTAIN SHARP	Where'd they go? Answer me!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Halt! Stop!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Stay there!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Where you going? What are you doing? Come down!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Social Services? Do you read me? Over!
SUZY	We might have to swim for it.
SAM	How deep is it? I didn't bring my life jacket.
SUZY	I don't know, but if it's too shallow, we'll break our necks, anyway. Hang onto me.
SAM	OK.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Counsellors? What's the legal perspective? Over!	I concur.	Open with article fifteen of the Codes of Civic Jurisdiction.	No party, under any circumstance, shall be denied due and proper consideration...
SUZY	On three again.
SAM	Wait. Just in case this is a suicide, or	100.
SAM	they capture us, and we never see each other again anymore -- thank you for marrying me. I'm glad I got to know you, Suzy.
SUZY	I think you've still got lightning in you.
SAM	Let's jump.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Goddammit!
CAPTAIN SHARP	Tell him! Over!
SOCIAL SERVICES	Is this acceptable to you, Mr. Shakusky?
CAPTAIN SHARP	What do you think, pal?
CAPTAIN SHARP	We're coming down! Over and out.
CAPTAIN SHARP	Don't let go.
