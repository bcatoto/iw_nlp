Prestige, The

STAGEHAND	Where'd you think you're going?!
BEARDED MAN	I'm part of the act, you fool!
CUTTER	Who was that?
CUTTER	Because of course, you're not really looking...
PROSECUTOR	And did Robert Angier, the Great Danton, your employer, get to that final part of his trick that night?
CUTTER	No, sir. Something went wrong.
PROSECUTOR	What went wrong?
CUTTER	I saw a someone head below the stage... I followed... and I found
BORDEN-
CUTTER	-watching Mr. Angier drown in a tank.
PROSECUTOR	Would you describe your occupation to the jury please, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER	I'm an ingeneur. I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them.
PROSECUTOR	And for how long had you been Mr.Angier's "ingeneur"?
CUTTER	Eight years. I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act.
PROSECUTOR	So, Mr.Cutter, was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr.Angier's illusion- the illusion billed as "THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN"?
CUTTER	No, sir. The tank had been used for the first trick, then taken offstage. Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval.
DEFENDER	How large was this tank?
CUTTER	The sort of tank used for underwater escapes- four or five hundred gallons.
DEFENDER	How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap door without anyone noticing?
CUTTER	Ask him- he's the magician.
DEFENDER	I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier's illusion.
CUTTER	If I reveal my magician's secrets here in open court, I'll be unemployable and the secrets will be worthless. The Real Transported Man is the most sought-after illusion in the business and I have te right to sell it on.
JUDGE	Mr.Cutter, I see your predicament but we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden's life hangs in the balance.
JUDGE	If you were prepared to disclose the details to me in private, I might be able to judge their relevance to the case. Might this be an acceptable compromisse?
CAPTAIN	I'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets.
CAPTAIN	Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw his show in Manchester last year where he vanished into thin air- he's convinced he'll try an escape.
CAPTAIN	I told him the only way Borden's going to disappear is if I leave him out with the others immates.
CAPTAIN	Check the locks. Twice.
OWENS	My name is Owens- I'm a solicitor.
OWENS	I represent Lord Caldlow, and accomplished amateur magician and historian of magic-
BORDEN	How much?
OWENS	Lord Caldlow is interested in-
BORDEN	How much for my tricks?
OWENS	Five thousand pounds.
BORDEN	Talk to Fallon, my ingenuer- the money's for him.
OWENS	I did. He offered to sell all of your tricks... except the most valuable one - The Transported Man.
BORDEN	I'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick.
OWENS	Even for your daughter?
OWENS	If the newspapers are right, and you're for the drop, your daughter's going to need looking after
BORDEN	Fallon can take care of-
OWENS	Bernard Fallon? A man with a past even more obscure than your own? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his "care". No, the girl is to be an orphan. I've been to the work house...
OWENS	It's better than this.
OWENS	I'm offering you a way to warp up your affairs with dignity, and I'm offering your daughter a future. As Lord Caldlow's ward she will want for nothing. Ever. (hands him a card) Think it over.
OWENS	Lord Caldlow wanted you to have this- (produces a leather
BOUND JOURNAL)	As a show of good faith. He thought it might be of interest.
OWENS	Robert Angier's diary... It includes the time he spent in Colorado learning your trick...
BORDEN	Angier never learned my trick.
OWENS	Really? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better, even... Than your original.
BORDEN	If you want Angier's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself.
OWENS	I want your secret, Mr.Borden... Consider your daughter!
ANGIER	The whole town has electricity?
ANGIER	Quit a reception.
MANAGER	You're our first guest of the season, Mr.Angier. (opens guest book) Your telegram didn't indicate how long you would be staying with us.
ANGIER	As long as it takes. I'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain.
MANAGER	The peak is closed, sit. For scientific experimentation.
ANGIER	That's why I'm here.
DRIVER	You have to walk the reat, I'm afraid, sir.
SHOTGUN	I'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers can't read mu sign.
ANGIER	Not the welcome I was expecting.
SHOTGUN	I know you. You're that magician-the Great Danton. (helps Angier up) I'm Alley. I saw your show. IN London. Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets.
ALLEY	I'm sorry about the fence. People keep interfering with our work.
ANGIER	I've come to see Tesla.
ALLEY	Why?
ANGIER	He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine. A long time ago. Can you get me a meeting with him? (off his look) I've come a very long way.
ALLEY	Impossible, I'm afraid.
ANGIER	I've brought a lot of money.
ALLEY	I'm sorry, Mr.Angier. I simply can't help you.
ANGIER	I'll be staying at the hotel. Indefinitely.
ALLEY	What am I holding?
ANGIER	Your watch.
MILTON	Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman...
MILTON	Are either of you two gentlemen gailors?
MILTON	Well, I'm sure you can both tie a strong knot...
BORDEN	Milton's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
ANGIER	Old favourites, please.
BORDEN	What about something fresh? He won't even try a bullet catch-
BORDEN
(INDICATES HIMSELF
AND ANGIER)
USE PLANTS-
ANGIER	He can't use plants for every trick.
JULIA	There'd be no seats left for the punters.
BORDEN	Fine- no bullet catch. But a real magician tries to invent something new, something other magicians scratch their heads over-
CUTTER	They sells it to them for a small fortune.
CUTTER	I suposse you have such a trick, Mr.Borden?
ANGIER	Actually, I do.
CUTTER	Care to sell it?
BORDEN	No one else could do my trick.
ANGIER	I could.
BORDEN	You don't even know what it is.
ANGIER	Show it to me twice, I'll do it.
CUTTER	I admire your spirit, Mr.Angier. But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do.
ANGIER	Why?
CUTTER	It might be something only he is prepared to do. (gestures to the props) my illusions employer, Mr.Milton, is a skilled showman. But Borden's right- he won't get his hands dirty. You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley. There's a Chinaman there who's got what it takes.
ANGIER	Chung Ling Soo.
BORDEN	Tickets are pricey.
CUTTER	I know a lad on the door. You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize.
ANGIER	Which is?
CUTTER	Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend, Mr.Ackerman.
JULIA	Who's Ackerman?
BORDEN	The most powerful theatrical agent in London.
CUTTER	I saw you drop the knot again, Borden.
JULIA	I think I had my wrist turned-
CUTTER	Some nights you just can't get it, can you? If that knot slips when Julia's on the hoist she'll break a leg.
BORDEN	It's the wrong knot. A Langford double would hold tighter.
CUTTER	The Langford double's not a wet knot it's too dangerous. The ropes could swell and she'd never slip it-
JULIA	I can slip a Lanford underwater.
BORDEN	We've been practiced it-
ANGIER	He said no.
CUTTER	No more mistakes.
ANGIER	Where's he from?
CUTTER	Where are you from?
CUTTER	He shuffles props for Virgil at the Hall.
ANGIER	He works for another magician? Aren't you worried he'll steal your tricks?
CUTTER	He doesn't deal in methods.
ANGIER	How do you know?
CUTTER	Because I hired him to try and find out Virgil's orange trick.
ANGIER	I don't know if I trust him.
CUTTER	He's a natural magician. Of course you can't trust him.
JULIA	I think he's alright.
ANGIER	You think everyone's alright.
JULIA	Even you.
CUTTER	And Mr.Angier...? (Angier looks up) Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife's ankle from the wings, the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can, too.
BORDEN	Look- he's all right. He's fine.
BOY	But where's his brother?
BORDEN	Sharp lad, your son.
YOUNG WOMAN	My brother.
BORDEN	You're the lucky one tonight.
BORDEN	(to the brother) Are you watching closely?
BORDEN	Look closer.
BOY	It's got two heads.
BORDEN	Never. Show. Anyone.
BORDEN	They'll beg you and flatter you for the secret- but as soon as you give it up you'll be nothing to them. Understand? Nothing. The secret impresses no one- the trick you use it for is everything.
BORDEN	Where do you two live?
SARAH	He lives with Mum.
BORDEN	And you?
BORDEN	Enough to keep me out?
SARAH	I think so. Wil I see you again?
ANGIER	You're wrong. It can't be.
BORDEN	It is. He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance.
ANGIER	but look at the man!
BORDEN	This is the trick. This is why no one detectes his method.
BORDEN	Total devotion to his art... (looks at Angier) Utter self-sacrifice. It's the only way to escape this.
ANGIER	I can barely lift this thing and it's not even filled with water. Or fish. He must be strong as an ox.
JULIA	He's been preteding to be an cripple for years?
ANGIER	Any time he's in public. Any time he goes out. It's unthinkable.
ANGIER	Borden saw it at once. I couldn't fathom it- living your whole life pretending to be someone else.
JULIA	You're pretending to be someone else.
ANGIER	I don't think changing your name compares.
JULIA	Not just your name- who you are, where you're from...
ANGIER	I promised my family I wouldn't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors.
JULIA	I came up with a name for you... "The Great Danton" You don't like it? It's sophisticated.
ANGIER	It's French.
SARAH	Alfred?!
BORDEN	We have our routine for Ackerman!
SARAH	We haven't had the pleasure.
BORDEN	Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
SARAH	Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN	Begged, borrowed and don't ask. Mr.Fallon's an enterprising soul.
SARAH	I need talk to you.
SARAH	We can't afford to pay him-
BORDEN	We'll start making money once we have our audience-
SARAH	And until then? What I earn is barely enough for us.
BORDEN	I'll give him half of my food.
SARAH	You're already going to be sharing it with someone else.
BORDEN	You're...?
SARAH	Having a baby.
SARAH	What's this?
BORDEN	The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition.
SARAH	Your great trick? The "masterpiece that will make our fortunes"?
BORDEN	No. The world isn't ready for that one, yet.
BORDEN	This is merely a run-of-the-mill daring and spectacular bullet catch-
SARAH	I'm not letting you get shot.
BORDEN	It's perfectly safe. Shoot me.
SARAH	Show me. (Borden shakes head) Then you're not doing it. I can't raise a child on my own, Alfred.
BORDEN	The bullet goes in the gun. Then comes the ramrod.
BORDEN
AND VOILS-
BORDEN	The buller's not even in the gun when the charge is fired.
SARAH	Once you know it's so obvious.
BORDEN	Yes, well, people still get killed perfoming it.
SARAH	How?
BORDEN	Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel.
SARAH	Such as?
BORDEN	A penny, or a button. Or, of course, a bullet. (off worried look) But don't fret-
BORDEN	I'm not letting anything happen- I love you too much.
SARAH	Say it again.
BORDEN	I love you.
SARAH	Nope. Not today.
BORDEN	What?
SARAH	Some days, it's not true. Todayt you don't mean it. Maybe today you're more in love with magic than me. It's alright. I like being able to tell the difference- it makes the days it is true mean something.
BORDEN	Bloody fool.
POLICEMAN	It's all laid out down the end, you honour.
JUDGE	What's in there?
CUTTER	Angier's machine.
JUDGE	You built this, Mr.Cutter?
CUTTER	Oh no. This wasn't built by a magician... it was built by a wizard. A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to...
CUTTER	your honour, what will happen to these things when the trial is over?
JUDGE	They've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo. An avid collector, apparently very interested in the case.
CUTTER	Don't let him take this.
JUDGE	Why ever not?
CUTTER	It's dangerous.
JUDGE	I'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it's get some simple and disappointing trick.
CUTTER	The most disappointing of all- it has no trick. It's real.
JUDGE	This is the tank Angier drowned in?
CUTTER	This lets the performer's hands reach the trick padlock... -a small section POPS open.
JUDGE	A standard magical apparatus for escapes?
CUTTER	With one important difference...
CUTTER	This isn't a trick lock... it's been switched out for a real one.
JUDGE	What a way to kill someone. Why in God's name go to such lengths?
CUTTER	These are magicians, you honour. Showmen. Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze. To shock.
JUDGE	Even without and audience?
CUTTER	There was and audience. (looks at Judge) See, the water tank had a particular signinficance for the two men...
MILTON	Which of you brave souls is willing bind this lovely young woman?
ANGIER	How can be not know?!
BORDEN	"How can be not know?!" Because, Angier, life is complicated, people are complicated, knots are
COMPLICATED-
JUDGE	Alfred Borden, you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier. You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
BORDEN	They took her away? To the workhouse?
BORDEN	Tell him I've reconsidered. It's for the best.
ALLEY	Tesla sends me down here during the storms. Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton.
ALLEY	Have you tried our Bourbon yet, Mr. Angier? It matches the scenery nicely. Two of 'em. Beautiful, isn't it? I do miss New York, though.
ANGIER	Why are you here?
ALLEY	The lightning lives here. And noit much else- our work is secret.
ALLEY	A cypher?
ANGIER	My profession also deals in secrets.
ANGIER	It's a rotating transposition that shifts every day of the dairy. Simple but time-consuming to translate once you have the five-letter keyword.
ALLEY	Which is?
ANGIER	We magicians have a circle of trust.
ALLEY	You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole?
ANGIER	Maybe I bought it.
ALLEY	Magicians sell their secrets?
ANGIER	It's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us.
ALLEY	You're hoping to find a great secretin there?
ANGIER	I've already found it. That's why I'm here.
ANGIER	Tesla built one for another magician.
ALLEY	Why would you want the same thing?
ANGIER	Call it a professional rivalry.
ALLEY	Tesla has built unusual machines for unusual people, but he would never talk about it.
ANGIER	I understand discretion. I just want the machine.
ALLEY	Finish your drink. You'll have a special appreciation for our work.
ANGIER	I thought it was a secret.
ALLEY	You're a magician. Who's going to believe you?
ALLEY	We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla doesn't want to scare anyone.
ALLEY	Not long now.
ALLEY	Our equipment requires a great deal of current. Tesla eletrified the whole town in exchange for using the generators when we need to.
ANGIER	Where are the wires?
ALLEY	Exactly.
ANGIER	Where's the generator?
ALLEY	You saw it last week.
ANGIER	But that must be ten miles from here.
ALLEY	Fifteen. And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed. (turns to leave) I'll send word for you in a few days, Mr.Angier.
VOICE	Get out your gun, Professor!
BORDEN	A volunteer.
BORDEN	Are you man enought, sir?
MOUSTACHE	Yes.
BORDEN	I think not.
ANGIER	Never thought I'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass.
CUTTER	Hasn't stopped you looking. I heard about a booking. Nice little theatre. Good up-and-coming magician.
ANGIER	Who?
CUTTER	You.
ANGIER	You got me a booking? Why?
CUTTER	Because I want to keep working... (looks up at Angier) And who's going to hire the ingeneur who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum?
ANGIER	Someone who know that it wasn't your fault. Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots.
CUTTER	Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river.
ANGIER	To die like that. Locked in water... lungs screaming... What did she go through, Cutter?
CUTTER	I knew an old sailor. Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets... they dragged him out, but it was five minutes before he coughed...
CUTTER	He said it was like... going home.
ANGIER	Which knot did Borden tie that night?
CUTTER	He wouldn't say.
ANGIER	Wouldn't say?!
CUTTER	It was as if... as if he didn't know.
CUTTER	We'll have to whitewash the windows to cofound the more curious members of your audience... But this should do.
ANGIER	We should see about an assistant.
CUTTER	I've made arrangements. Have you settled on a name?
ANGIER	Yes, I have. The Great Danton.
CUTTER	Hmm. Bit old-fashioned?
ANGIER	No. It's sophisticated.
OLIVIA	What's so hard about this?
CUTTER	In here, Miss Wenscombe. No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit.
CUTTER	Breathe as little as possible.
CUTTER	Not much experience , but she knows the basics. She knows how to present herself and a pretty assistant's the most effective from of misdirection.
CUTTER	I suppose I should let her out.
SARAH	I don't understand, Alfred. How can it be bleeding again?
SARAH	What have you been doing to it? It looks as had as the day it happened. We need to get the doctot back-
BORDEN	We can' afford the doctor back!
SARAH	You've woken her.
BORDEN	I'm sorry. I just need this to heal so I can het back to work.
SARAH	Alfred, you have to face things. What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury?
BORDEN	Some of the card pulls, prop tricks... (leans forward, excited) And the trick I've been telling you about. The trick they'll remember me for.
ANGIER	The bird cage can't be our climax- everybody knows it.
CUTTER	Not like this, they don't.
ANGIER	And I don't want to kill doves.
CUTTER	Then stay off the stage. (glares at Angier) You're a magician, not a wizard- you have to get your hands dirty to achieve the impossible.
ANGIER	You sound like him.
CUTTER	(holds up cage) Put your hands on the sides...
ANGIER	I need a volunteer.
CUTTER	Hang on, hang on...
CUTTER	There we go. Now you tell the volunteer to put his hands here...
MERRIT	You'd beat not be intending to hut this animal, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER	Of course not.
ANGIER	And one, two... THREE!
ANGIER
ANGIER	Bloody marvelous, Cutter.
CUTTER	And the best part...
ANGIER	Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty.
CUTTER	Someday, perhaps you will. I needed to know that you can.
MERRIT	Very nice. Very nice indeed.
ANGIER	I haven't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet, Mr.Merrit.
MERRIT	A lot more beautiful when it's full, Mr.Angier.
ANGIER	Don't worry.
MERRIT	You all say that. Why sould I worry? If your tricks don't get 'em in, someone else's will. Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape.
CUTTER	cheap thrills, Mr.Merrit. People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one, too. What would that do for your business?
MERRIT	You've got a week.
ANGIER	You sir, in the hat. Could you show us your handkerchief?
MAN	This isn't mine.
ANGIER	Perhaps you'd be so good as to return it to the other man. He has yours.
OLIVIA	I'm so nervous- I'm sorry, I'm making mistakes.
ANGIER	The audience doesn't seem to be responding much, Cutter.
CUTTER	This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They've seen most of these tricks before. But not this next one. You'll see.
CUTTER	You! Piss off out it!
ANGIER	Wish us luc, Cutter.
CUTTER	I'll have the champagne ready.
ANGIER	You've seen this one before?
ANGIER	Well, I'll make it a little harder, shall I?
ANGIER	Two volunteers, please. A lady and a gentleman to hold this cage with me...
ANGIER	I'll perform this feat in a manner never before seen by yourselves or by any other audience anywhere in the worth...
ANGIER	Any magician can make this cage disappear... that's why I'll ask this good lady and fine gentleman to place their hands firmly on the cage...
ANGIER	...to ensure that no trickery whatsover is employed.
ANGIER	I should've spotted him.
CUTTER	You had a lot of plates spinning.
ANGIER	Don't suppose they'll let us do this one again.
CUTTER	No.
ANGIER	So what's the climax of our show?
ANGIER	Mr.Merrit, we have a week's engagment-
MERRIT	To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer's fingers! Clear out, anything here in the morning gets burned.
CUTTER	Mr.Merrit-
MERRIT	It's done, John. I've hired a comedian. You know I hate comedians, which should indicate the may I felel about your friend's future as a stage magician.
CUTTER	There are plenty of good theatres... if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
ANGIER	The name stays.
CUTTER	Right. Well, the new trick will have to be irresistible, then. I've a couple of methods to try out, but we'll need a fresh angle on the presentation.
CUTTER	If you need inspiration, there's a technical exposition at the Albert Hall this week. Scientists and engineers. That sort of thing captures the popular imagination.
TICKET HAWKER	Would you like to know the future, sir? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now. Continents divided no more. Free, clean power. The mysteries of the world solved.
TESLA	With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years.
TESLA	Mr. Edison's direct current system is flawed and dangerous. With my alternating current devices-
AUDIENCE MEMBER	Fraud.
BORDEN	I love you.
SARAH	See? Today, it's true.
ANGIER	The family life he craves one minute he rails against the next, demanding freedom. His mind is a divided one...
BORDEN	Guard! Guard!!
GUARD	What do want, Professor?
BORDEN	Paper and pencil. Please.
SULLEN	Let me see?
SULLEN	I'm going to know all of the Professor's secrets.
BORDEN	Only if I teach you how to read.
SULLEN	Just stupid tricks, right? Haven't helped you get out of here-
)	Have they? Or can't you open real locks, Professor?
BORDEN	Perhaps I'm just biding my time. Perhaps one day I'll just hold up my
HAND-
BORDEN	-get you attention. Then quietly
SAY-	"are you wacthing closely"... perhaps say a magic word or two... then I'll be gone.
SULLEN	How'd you get so famous, then?
BORDEN	Magic.
SULLEN	Oi, Borden, get back here!
ANGIER	I thought you'd gone.
OLIVIA	I don't really.... have anywhere to go.
ANGIER	You've been sleeping here?
OLIVIA	Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking. What are you doing?
ANGIER	Researching. Part of a magician's job is to watch his competition, to see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA	You're going to do something to that man, aren't you?
OLIVIA	Cutter's hopig you'll let things life. He says if Borden thinks things are even between you then we can-
ANGIER	Even? My wife for a couple of his fingers? He has a child now. And he's perfoming again. Borden is out there, living his life just as he always intended. As if nothing had happened. And look at me. I'm alone. And no theatre will touch me.
OLIVIA	Us.
OLIVIA	You're going to need a better disguise.
BORDEN	I need a volunteer.
BORDEN	As you can see , it's just a rubber ball. But it's not normal at all.
BORDEN	Thank you.
BORDEN	You're not impressed?
BORDEN	It's a magic ball.
OLIVIA	What happened, Robert?
ANGIER	He had a new trick.
OLIVIA	Was it good?
ANGIER	Did they applaud when you saw it?
CUTTER	Not very enthusiastically.
CUTTER	The trick is too good -- too simple- the audience harly knows what they've seen.
ANGIER	He's a dreadful magician.
CUTTER	He's a wonderfull magician- he's a dreadful showman. He doesn't know how to dress it up, how to sell the trick.
ANGIER	How does he do it?
CUTTER	He uses a double.
ANGIER	It's not that simple. This is a complex illusion.
CUTTER	You think that because you don't know the method. It's a double who comes out at the end. It's the only way.
ANGIER	I've seen his perfom ir three times now, Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
SAME MAN-
CUTTER
IT'S NOT-
ANGIER	The same man comes out of the second cabinet. I promise you.
OLIVIA	It is the same man.
OLIVIA	He wears padded gloves to hide his damaged fingers, but if you look closely you can tell.
ANGIER	He doesn't know how to sell his trick to an audience. But I do.
CUTTER	It would give us our climax.
ANGIER	The man stole my life. I'm going to steal his trick.
CUTTER	We'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage.
ANGIER	He doesn't use a double-
CUTTER	I don't know how Borden does it, Robert. So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret, or you can listen to how I would do this trick. Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double.
ANGIER	Take a good look- let's get out there and find me.
ALLEY	It's perfectly safe.
TESLA	So this is the Great Danton.
TESLA	Mr. Alley has effused about your act to me on any number of occasions. Something you did with pockets?
ANGIER	I saw a lecture you gave in London, several years ago. I'm flattered you agreed to see me.
ANGIER	What's conducting the electricity?
TESLA	Our bodies, Mr. Angier, are quite capable of conducting, and indeed, producing energy.
TESLA	Have you eaten, Mr. Angier?
TESLA	Alley has explained that you require a very interesting device.
ANGIER	I need something impossible.
TESLA	You're familiar with a phrase 'Man's reach exceeds his grasp'?
TESLA	(off his look) It's a lie. Man's grasp exceeds his nerve. The only limits on scientific progress are these imposed by society.
TESLA	The first time I changed the world I was hailed as a visionary. The second time I was asked politely to retire. The world only tolerates one change at a time. And so here I am. (gestures at laboratory) Enjoying "retirement". (looking at Angier) Nothing is impossible, Mr. Angier. What you want is simply expensive.
TESLA	Alley says you are a stage magician. If a built you this device, you would be presenting it only as an illusion?
ANGIER	If people thought the things I did on stage were real, they wouldn't clap- they'd scream. Think of saving a woman in half.
TESLA	Mr.Angier, the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER	Price is not an object.
TESLA	Perhaps not. But have you considered the cost?
ANGIER	I'm noit sure I follow.
TESLA	I can make your machine, Mr. Angier. But I can also give you some advice... Go home. Forget this thing. I can recognize an obsession. As Mr. Alley could tell you, I myself an given to one now and then. It will not do you any good.
ANGIER	Have your obsessions done you no good?
TESLA	At first. But I've followed them too long- I am their slave. Their whipping boy. And one day they may choose to destroy me.
ANGIER	if you understand an obsession then you know you won't change my mind.
TESLA	So be it.
ANGIER	Will you build it?
TESLA	I have already begun to build it, Mr. Angier. I hope you enjoy the mountain air. This will take time.
OLIVIA	Gerry?
OLIVIA	Mr. Angier, Mr. Cutter, I would like you to meet Mr. Gerald Root.
ROOT	A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen.
ROOT	Would you like for me to tell you a little joke?
ROOT	Are you laughing?
ANGIER	He's out of his mind.
OLIVIA	He's an out-of-work actor- of course he's out of his mind.
CUTTER	He's perfect. A little work, mind you, but when I'm done with him he could be your brother.
ANGIER	I don't need him to be my brother. I need him to be me.
BORDEN	Would you like to see a magic trick?
SARAH	What is this for?
SARAH	When I asked last week you said we couldn't afford.
BORDEN	You caught me in the wrong mood.
SARAH	But you want through all the-
BORDEN	Sarah, I'm allowed to change my mind, aren't I? The act is taking off, maybe soon I'll get us into a bigger theatre. Things will work.
OLIVIA	You walk through this one- then...?
OLIVIA	Oof. Couldn't you find a softer one?
ANGIER	It's not for sleeping on.
OLIVIA	And Root goes up through there?
OLIVIA	It's going to be amazing, Robert.
ANGIER	It has to be. Borden's trick is getting noticed. The place was packed today.
OLIVIA	You went and saw his show again?
OLIVIA	You becoming obsessed, Robert.
ANGIER	All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference.
CUTTER	A little faith, sir. Could you favor us with a perfomance. Mr. Root?
ROOT	You would drink, too, if you know the world half so well as I do.
ROOT	Did you think you were unique, Mr. Angier? I have been Cassar. I have been Faust. How difficult could it possibly be to play 'The Great Danton?'
CUTTER	You can go back to being yourself. Root. For free..
ROOT	I'd rather be him, for now. I find it amusing.
CUTTER	Root has to keep a low profile-- anyone sees him the game's up.
ANGIER	I don't know how you do these things, Cutter. I'm not sure I want to know.
CUTTER	Have you thought about what we should call the trick?
ANGIER	No point being coy. Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man'?
ANGIER	Ladies and gentlemen, much of what you've seen tonight can be termed illusions. Entertaining trifles of the sort you may have seen other magicians perform.
ANGIER	Alas, I cannot claim this next feat as illusion. Watch carefully- you will see no trickery, for no trickery is being employed. Merely a techique familiar to certain citizens of the orient and various holy men of the Himalyas. Indeed, some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
OLIVIA	To our achivement.
CUTTER	The manager said he's never seen a reaction like it.
ANGIER	At least he got to see it. I spent the ovation hidden under the stage. No one cares about the man who disappears, the man who goes into the box. They care about the man who comes out the other side.
OLIVIA	I care about the man in the box.
ANGIER	Thank you. Maybe we could switch before the trick. That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage.
CUTTER	The antecipation of the trick is everything- it needs your showmanship to built suspense. If Root opens his mouth, it's all over- he can't introduce the trick.
CUTTER	Root, you bloody fool, get that costume and makeup off right now, anyone could walk in here!
CUTTER	Congratulation, all.
ANGIER	I suppose I should get more rest.
OLIVIA	Life is not full of these moments, Robbie.
OLIVIA	We've worked hard for this, and we need to celebrate properly.
OLIVIA	What's wrong? It is your wife?
ANGIER	The trick isn't good enough.
OLIVIA	Didn't you see the audience?
ANGIER	No.
OLIVIA	Well, they loved it.
ANGIER	It's not as good as his trick.
OLIVIA	Borden's trick is nothing compared to ours. He doesn't have any style-
ANGIER	He doesn't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage.
ANGIER	I need to know how he does it.
OLIVIA	Why?
ANGIER	So that I can do it better.
ANGIER	I need you to go and work for him.
OLIVIA	Work for him? Are you joking
ANGIER	You'll be my spy.
OLIVIA	We just got our start and you want me to leave?
ANGIER	It's how we advance.
ANGIER	Think of it, Olivia... we've got people excited about Cutter's version of the trick- imagine what we could do with the real illusion. We'll have the greatest magic act anyone's ever seen.
OLIVIA	He knows I work for you.
ANGIER	Exactly why he'll want to hire you. He'll want my secrets.
OLIVIA	Why would he trust me?
ANGIER	Because you're going to tell him the truth.
TESLA	You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you, Mr. Angier.
TESLA	Fitting that you should be here for the maiden voyage.
TESLA	Your hat.
ALLEY	You might want to stand back.
TESLA	No, no. It will be fine. Mr. Alley, please proceed.
ANGIER	I don't understand-
ALLEY	Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it. We'll see you next week?
OLIVIA	Interesting workshop.
BORDEN	We make do.
OLIVIA	My name is Olivia Wenscombe.
BORDEN	I know who you are. Are you here to steal the rest of my show?
OLIVIA	No. I'm here to give your show what is missing.
BORDEN	And what might that be?
OLIVIA	Me.
BORDEN	Wasn't I just saying that, Bernard? A woman's touch.
OLIVIA	I've left Angier. I want a job.
OLIVIA	I know you have no reason to trust
ME-
BORDEN	Why on earth shouldn't I trust you? The mistress of my enemy.
OLIVIA	Mr.Borden-
BORDEN	Alfred.
OLIVIA	Alfred. I'm going to tell you the truth.
BORDEN	Ah. The truth. A slippery notion in our life of work, Miss Wenscombe.
OLIVIA	I'm here because he sent me here. He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret.
BORDEN	What does he need my secret for? His trick is top notch. The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly reappears on the other side of the stage -- mute, overweight, and, unless I'm mistaken, rather drunk.
BORDEN	Tell me, Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA	No. It's killing him. he's obsessed with discovering your method. He thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our sucess. I've had enough. There's no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN	He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN	And this is the truth?
CUTTER	Best be getting changed for the martinee, sir.
CUTTER	ROOT! You're late. And even more drunk than usual. Get yourself below stairs, right away!
ROOT	No.
CUTTER	No?!
ROOT	We need to have a chat, Mr.Cutter.
ANGIER	We have a problem, Cutter.
ANGIER	He'll be perfoming right across the street.
CUTTER	We have a bigger problem. Root.
ANGIER	Don't tell me he fell over again.
CUTTER	Worse. He realized he can make demands.
ANGIER	He's blackmailing us?
CUTTER	In a word, yes. I'm surprised, to be honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out.
ANGIER	How much does he want?
CUTTER	It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick.
ANGIER	Stop doing the trick? Look at this.
CUTTER	Look at yesterday's. And last week's, where they called you "London's premiere stage performer", not "magician" mind. Performer. Of any kind.
ANGIER	What's the point?
CUTTER	My point, Robert, is that you've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament. We're not doing any tricks we can't control.
ANGIER	Pay him whatever he wants, for now. We keep doing the trick till Borden opens, then we'll phase it out.
ANGIER	Get up there!!
CUTTER	Get it down!
ROOT	To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale?
BORDEN	You are the Great Danton, aren't you?
ROOT	Of course I am. But don't advertise it- I'll be mobbed with fans. (grins at Borden) And who might you be?
BORDEN	Just a humble admirer. And fellow practitioner.
ROOT	Ah, very good.
BORDEN	Another?
ROOT	If you insist. I'm not perfoming tonight. Well, only one show, and, to be frank, my people pretty much run things these days.
BORDEN	You could probably do it blindfolded.
ROOT	Bloody good idea.
BORDEN	Have it.
ROOT	Thanks.
BORDEN	Actually, there's something I might warn you about.
ROOT	Oh?
BORDEN	Well, it's your Transported Man illusion. Now, I'm noit claiming to know your method... but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used... (looks around,
WHISPERING)	...a double.
ROOT	Oh, I see, very good.
BORDEN	At first. Then it went bad. You se, I hadn't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act, he had complete power over me.
ROOT	Complete power, you say?
BORDEN	Weel, he was the secret, you see. And the more successful I became, the more outrageous his demands became. He practically backrupted me. In the end I had to stop performing the illusion completely. (looks at Root) You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you.
ROOT	Thanks for the warning.
ANGIER	...some of you may be familiar with this technique, but for those of you who aren't, do not be alarmed, what you are about to see is considered safe...
BORDEN	Great Danton, I must apologize! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages!
BORDEN	Pardon my intrusion!
CUTTER	I don't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps, I was careful.
ANGIER	Well, he did.
CUTTER	Sit, do you think it might be her? Olivia?
ANGIER	No. I don't.
CUTTER	Shall we cut him down?
ANGIER	He's the Great Danton. Let him cut himself down.
ANGIER	You weren't expecting me?
OLIVIA	I was expecting you sooner, Robbie. Your message said "afternoon".
ANGIER	Well, it takes a bit for me to get around these days...
ANGIER	He's taken everything from me. My wife, my career... now you.
OLIVIA	What do you mean? You sent me to-
ANGIER	I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
OLIVIA	That's my job-!
ANGIER	Or to fall in love with him!
OLIVIA	You abandoned me to him!
OLIVIA	I did everything you asked.
ANGIER	Yes? Then how does he do it?!
OLIVIA	Cutter was right- it's a double.
ANGIER	Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA	He didn't say anything- he'd never say. I've seen things- make-up, glasses, wigs. We don't use any of it for the show, but I've found it hidden backstage.
ANGIER	It's misdirection- he leaves those things lying around to make you think he's using a double.
OLIVIA	All the time? He doesn't know when
I'M LOOKING-
ANGIER	All the time, Olivia- that's who he is, that's what it takes- he lives his act, don't you see?! And just because you're sleeping with him doesn't mean he trusts you.
OLIVIA	You thing you can see everything, don't you?
OLIVIA	But the Great Danton, is a blind fool.
OLIVIA	His notebook.
ANGIER	You stole it?
OLIVIA	I borrowed it for tonight. I thought you'd be able to translate some of it, but now I realize-
ANGIER	I can't.
OLIVIA	You can't.
ANGIER	Olivia, no one could- It's a cypher- with a transposition that probably shifts every day of the diary. Even with the keyword it would take months to decode...
OLIVIA	And without the keyword?
ANGIER	Perhaps never. We'll see.
OLIVIA	No, we won't- if I don't get that back tomorrow morning, he'll know I took it.
ANGIER	You can'r possibly think I'd let this go? This is his diary, Olivia. All of his secrets are right here, in my hands.
OLIVIA	Don't do this do me, Robert!
ANGIER	Leave him.
OLIVIA	He knows where I live!
ANGIER	I need to know his method.
OLIVIA	It won't get your wife back, Robert.
ANGIER	I don't care about my wife- I care about his secret!
ANGIER	Look, I'll go to his workshop and stage a break-in-
OLIVIA	He'll know it was you-
ANGIER	Yes, me, not you. Understand?
OLIVIA	Robert? I have fallen in love with him.
ANGIER	Then I know how hard this had been hard for you.
BORDEN	Notebook.
BORDEN	Then he's just getting started.
BORDEN	I'm walking tonight, gentlemen.
BORDEN	Let him come. I don't care.
CUTTER	I'll live. You save me the trouble to making you an air hole!
BORDEN	I'm impressed.
ANGIER	Why's that?
BORDEN	You're finally getting your hands dirty. This is what a good trick costs, Angier. Risk. Sacrifice.
ANGIER	The sacrifice, I'm afraid, is all going to be yours. Unless you give me what I want.
BORDEN	Which is?
ANGIER	Your secret.
BORDEN	My secret?
ANGIER	Your method for the Transported Man. Fallon wouldn't tell me. In fact, he doesn't talk at all.
BORDEN	You have my notebook.
ANGIER	Useless without the keyword.
ANGIER	Write down your method Mr. Borden. Describe it in full.
ANGIER	I want the method not the keyword- I don't even know if the secret is in you notebook.
BORDEN	The keyword is the method.
BORDEN	Where is my ingeneur?
BORDEN
IS HE
ANGIER	How fast can you gid?
ANGIER	How's the arm?
CUTTER	Still attached. Did you get your answer?
ANGIER	Our answer, Cutter. I haven't looked yet, I wanted you to share this.
CUTTER	I already know how he does it, Robert. The same way he always has, the same way we do. You just want it to be something more.
ANGIER	Well, let's find out, shall we?
-TESLA-
CUTTER	What does it mean?
ANGIER	It means, Cutter, that we have a journey ahead of us. To America.
CUTTER	Robert, listen to me. (gentle, but definite) Obssession is a young man's game, I can't follow you any farther in this.
ANGIER	Then the rest is up to me.
SARAH	I didn't know we'd be joined for dinner.
BORDEN	Absolutely. We're celebrating.
SARAH	Miss Wenscombe. Mr.Fallon.
BORDEN	(to wine waiter) Champagne. Your finest
SARAH	What are we celebrating, dear?
BORDEN	Well, we've hit upon a new trick, haven't we, Fallon?
OLIVIA	What trick, Freddy?
SARAH	Yes, "Freddy". What trick?
BORDEN	I'm going to bury myself alive. Every night. Then someone's going to come along and dig me up!
SARAH	I'm not sure my husband needs-
BORDEN	Who are you to tell me what?!
OLIVIA
PERHAPS-
SARAH	Perhaps, Mr.Fallon, you might escort Miss Wenscombe home. My husband's being a bore. I see no reason for the two of you to suffer as well.
OLIVIA	Good-night, Mrs.Borden. Good-night, Freddy.
SARAH	"Freddy"?
BORDEN	It's my name.
SARAH	Not at home.
BORDEN	I'm not always at home.
SARAH	Alfred, why are you being like this?
BORDEN	Sarah, I had a terrible ordeal today. I thought I'd lost something very precious to me.
SARAH	What?
SARAH	I see. More secrets.
BORDEN	Secrets are my life, Sarah. Our life.
SARAH	When you're like this, Alfred, I'm not seeing the real you. You're treating me like your audience. Performing. I can't live with that.
ANGIER	I thought I had the place to myself.
MANAGER	Unexpected guests. (looks out the window at the men) Not very polite. A lot of questions. At first I thought they might work for the government.
ANGIER	No?
MANAGER	Worse. They work for Thomas Edison.
BORDEN	Tell me Olivia. Does he like taking his bows under the stage?
OLIVIA	No. It's killing him. He's obssessed with discovering your method. he thinks of nothing else, and takes no pleasure in our success. I've had enough. There is no future with him. He sent me here to steal your secrets, but I've actually come to offer you his.
BORDEN	He has no secrets from me.
BORDEN	This is the "truth" you spoke of?
OLIVIA	No. This is what he told me to tell you.
OLIVIA	The truth is that I loved him. And stood by him. And he sent me to you like he'd send a stagehand to pick up his shirts. (looks him in the eye) I hate him for that.
BORDEN	I can spot Angier's methods from the back of the theatre. What could you possibly have to offer me?
OLIVIA	You may know he does his tricks... but you can't understand why no one can see that yours are better.
OLIVIA	You hide this. I had to look closely to spot it when you performed the Transported Man. (looks into his eyes) But this makes you unique... it shows the audience that you aren't using a double; You musn't hide it, you must display it proudly... (looks at hand) I'm sure it takes great skill to perform illusions with one good hand.
BORDEN	It does.
OLIVIA	Then let people know. You can be so much more then he is. I can show you how.
BORDEN	How could he send you away? He must be blind, deaf and dumb.
OLIVIA	Robbie's blinded by his jealosy. He'd do anything for you secret. Sending me away was the least of it.
ANGIER
ANGIER
ANGIER	I've veen played for a fool!
ALLEY	Who by?
ANGIER	Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for.
ALLEY	We never said he had.
ANGIER	You let me believe that he had, Alley!
ANGIER	You stole my money because your funding was cut off- you've been shooting sparks at my top hat, laughing at me all along while you use my money to stave off ruin. I've seen Edison's men-
ALLEY	Where?
ANGIER	In the hotel. I've every mind to bring them up here myself-
TESLA	That would be unwise, Mr.Angier.
TESLA	It is true, sir, that you are your one remaining financier. But we have not stolen your money...
ALLEY	Sir, my cat?
ALLEY	When I told you I could make your machine I spoke the simple truth. Science is just a name for the art of rendering the exotic mundane. It has no boundaries- its very purpose is to destroy boundaries.
ANGIER	Then why isn't the machine working?
TESLA	Because exact science, Mr.Angier, is not an exact science. The machine simply does not operate as expected. It needs continued examination.
ANGIER	Where did my top hat go?
ALLEY	Nowhere.
ALLEY	We've tried the damn thing a dozen times. And the hat went nowhere.
TESLA	Which is why we need to rey a different material. It may provoke a different result.
TESLA	You don't expect me to handle the thing myself?
ALLEY	You are responsible for whatever happens to this animal, Doctor.
ANGIER	I'll go.
ANGIER	Here, kitty, kitty.
ANGIER	So the machine was working?
ALLEY	I never bothered to check the calibration. The hat never moved.
TESLA	These things never quite work as you expect them to, Mr. Angier. That's one of the principal beauties of science.
TESLA	We'll need a couple of weeks to iron
OUT THE-	(looks at hats) -problems with the machine. I'll send word when it's ready.
TESLA	Don't forget your hat.
ANGIER	Which one is mine?
TESLA	They are all your hat, Mr. Angier.
JESS	Are we going to the zoo this afternoon, daddy?
BORDEN	Daddy's got some business this afternoon.
JESS	But you promised.
BORDEN	Did I?
BORDEN	Then go to the zoo we shall.
BORDEN	(gestures to newspaper) Who's that?
JESS	That's you, daddy?
BORDEN	Daddy has some errands to run. I'll be back before you know it, so get ready.
SARAH	We each have our vices.
BORDEN	Sarah. Whatever you may think, your only competitions for my affections is my little girl. I love you. I will always love you, and you alone.
SARAH	You mean it today.
BORDEN	Absolutely.
SARAH	That makes it so much harder when you don't.
BORDEN	More shopping. She doesn't like the smell of money, doesn't she?
BORDEN	The little lady wants to visit the Zoo, I thought you could take her. I'll do it tomorrow, if not. (looks at his feet) Sarah... she knows. At least, she knows things aren't right. (looks at Fallon,
PLEADING)	Help me with her. Try and convince her that I love her. Please.
OLIVIA	What is it. Freddy?
BORDEN	Please don't call me that. It's nothing, just... sometimes things seem... wrong.
OLIVIA	Freddy, I've told you before. When you're with me, you're with me. Leave your family at home where they belong.
BORDEN	I'm trying, Olivia. Please.
OLIVIA	I'll get dressed.
OLIVIA	There's something about him I don't trust.
BORDEN	You trust me? (off her look) Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about.
MANAGER	We're sorry to see you go, Mr. Angier.
MANAGER	We are sorry to see Mr. Tesla leave as well. He was very good to Colorado Springs. A very generous man.
MANAGER	Mr. Angier? I didn't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box.
ANGIER	What box?
MANAGER	We never use these rooms in the off - season. It's a shame.
TESLA	Such thing will only bring you misery.
ANGIER	Yes, you, Borden. Sitting there, in your cell, reading my diary. Awaiting your death. For my murder.
OWENS	Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you'd reconsidered his offer.
BORDEN	Angier's journal, the "gesture of good faith"? It's a fake.
OWENS	I assure you it's not.
BORDEN	It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death.
OWENS	Clever predictions, I'm sure. The provenance of the journal is clear and under no doubt. It's written in Angier own hand, of which we have numerous examples. (looks at Borden) What makes you think it's a fake?
BORDEN	It doesn't matter.
BORDEN	My tricks. All of them.
OWENS	Including the Transported Man? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased.
BORDEN	No he won't. They're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each.
OWENS	Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless.
BORDEN	You'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here.
BORDEN	I want to say goodbye.
SARAH	Deny it all you want- I know!
BORDEN	Sarah, it's not true! I've told you Olivia means nothing to me!
SARAH	I'll go yo her! I know what you really are, Alfred!
BORDEN	Sarah. You can't do that.
SARAH	I can't live like this!
BORDEN	What do you want from me!
SARAH	I want you to be honest with me. No tricks, no lies, no secrets.
SARAH	Do you love me?
BORDEN	Not today.
SARAH	Thank you.
WHO'S THERE
CUTTER	I- I'm looking for an old friend-
ANGIER	Nice little theatre. Good up-and- coming magician.
CUTTER	You came back.
ANGIER	It's a good to see you, John.
CUTTER	Good rehearsal space. Blind stagehands. I like it- You always had an eye for publicity.
ANGIER	I need your help, John. My last show. A limited engagement.
CUTTER	Your last show?
ANGIER	A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man's game. I'm almost done. One thing left... (points at crate) The real Transported Man.
CUTTER	You want to design a show around it?
ANGIER	i don't want you backstage, I need you front of house, managing.
ANGIER	i need you calling in any favours and connections you have left to get us the right booking for the run.
CUTTER	What sort of booking are you after?
ANGIER	The sort that Borden can't ignore.
DRIVER	This is the address, sir.
CUTTER	Mr.Ackerman. It's an honor to see you again, sir.
ACKERMAN	When you said you only wanted to show me one trick it piqued my interest.
CUTTER	It's a very special trick. Mr.Ackerman.
ANGIER	Pleased to meet you, Mr. Ackerman.
ACKERMAN	Likewise, I'm sure. Let's get on, shall we?
CUTTER	(down to stage) Turn it on, please.
ACKERMAN	Very pretty.
ACKERMAN	That's it, Cutter? He simply disappears? That's not a trick. He has to come back. There has to be a-
ACKERMAN
EXACTLY-
ACKERMAN	(quiet, haunted) Pardon me. It's very rare to see... real magic. it's been many years since I've seen...
ANGIER	Are you interested in helping us?
ACKERMAN	Yes. But you'll have to dress it up a little. Disguise it. Give them enough reason to doubt it.
MERRIT	Mr. Ackerman. When they said...I didn't think you'd be here in person.
ACKERMAN	I have an act for your venue.
MERRIT	Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet. They're playing through next year.
ACKERMAN	Get rid of them. This is a magical act. An excellent one. I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago. The Great Danton.
MERRIT	You really want me to-
MERRIT	I'll do it. Of course.
ACKERMAN	There will be one hundred performances. No more, no less. Five perfomances a week. No matinees, no weekends.
ACKERMAN	And that's what you'll be charging for each ticket. Good day.
OLIVIA	You haven't spopken about her, Freddy. Not once.
BORDEN	Who?
OLIVIA	Don't be cruel.
BORDEN	Why would I talk about her to you?
OLIVIA	Because she was part of your life and now she's gone.
OLIVIA	She wanted to meet me the day before she killed herself. Said she had something to tell me about you. I was such a coward, I couldn't bring myself to face her. (looks at Borden) What would she have said, I wonder?
BORDEN	You want the truth about me, Olivia? (she nods, wary) I never loved Sarah.
OLIVIA	You married her, had a child with
HER-
BORDEN	Part of me loved her. But part of me didn't. The part that found you. The part that's sitting here now. I love you. That is the truth that matters.
OLIVIA	You could be sitting in some other restaurant talking to some other woman about me that way. It's unhuman to be so cold.
OLIVIA	By the way, have you seen who's opened at the Pantages? (Borden shakes head) The Great Danton.
BORDEN	He's back?
OLIVIA	After two years. And he has a new trick. They're saying it's the best that London's ever seen.
OLIVIA	If you could see the look on your face, Professor. You should go to him- you deserve each other.
ANGIER	Ladies and gentlemen, my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk. (removes his coat) Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now, for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it, you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved.
ANGIER	In my travels I have seen the future, and it is a strange future indeed. The world is on the brink of new and terrifying possibilities.
ANGIER	Man's reach exceeds his IMAGINATION!
BORDEN	Why only 100 performances? Do his methods dictate it, or is it simply a publicity move?
BORDEN	Fifty yards in a second. And all I know is that he uses a trapdoor. What's going on under that stage?
BLIND STAGEHAND
CUTTER	It's Cutter.
BLIND STAGEHAND	What do you want?
CUTTER	I'm looking for Angier.
ANGIER	You found him.
ANGIER	I told you, John- I don't want you backstage on this one.
CUTTER	What are they doing?
ANGIER	Disposing of the Prestige materials.
CUTTER	What's down there?
ANGIER	Do you really want to know?
CUTTER	Perhaps not.
BORDEN	They do this every night. After each performance?
BORDEN	We're done. (turns to Fallon) Let him have this trick. You're not to go back there. I don't need to know his secret. Leave him alone.
STAGEHAND	Where'd you think you're going?
BORDEN	I'm part of the act, you fool!
CUTTER	Who was that?
CUTTER	What did you do?
JUDGE	You will, in one month's time, be hanged by the neck until dead. May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
OWENS	Mr.Cutter? Owens.
CUTTER	Thank you for coming, Mr.Owens. It's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier's equipment. Looking at the manifest, it's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items.
OWENS	Mr.Cutter, if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-
CUTTER	It's not just that, Mr.Owens. There is a particular item (turns to crate) This time, in fact, that I wish to... well, that is to say, I want to-
OWENS	You wnat to buy it instead.
CUTTER	I suppose so, yes.
OWENS	This is the machine? I'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item.
CUTTER	Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person.
OWENS	Out of the question, I'm afraid.
OWENS	of course, I suppose... if, in the course of your delivery arrangements your paths were to cross... I can't stop you from speaking your mind.
SULLEN	Still here, Borden?
BORDEN	For now.
SULLEN	Got a visitor. Lord Caldlow. With a little girl.
BORDEN	Jess, how are you?
BORDEN	Are you alright?
BORDEN	I've missed you. Fallon's missed you. We both have.
JESS	Can I come in there, Daddy?
BORDEN	Everything's going to be okay.
BORDEN	You must be Lord-
ANGIER	Caldlow. Yes, I am. I always have been.
BORDEN	I saw you die.
ANGIER	They flatter you with all those chains, Alfred. Don't they know you can't escape without your little rubber ball?
ANGIER	All I wanted to do was prove that I was the better magician. But you couldn't leave me alone.
BORDEN	You were always afraid to get your hands dirty... (looks down at his
JESS)	Not anymore.
ANGIER	No. Not anymore. And I win. Because no one cares about the man in the box, the man who disappears.
BORDEN	You win. But don't take my little girl...
ANGIER	I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away, don't I
ANGIER	Borden? But you can't take her with you know, can you? She'll be looked after. Good-bye, Professor.
BORDEN	Wait. Don't you want this? You paid for it.
ANGIER	Your secret.
ANGIER	You always were the better magician, Borden. We both know that.
ANGIER	But whatever your secret was, you'll have to agree-
ANGIER	-mine is better.
BORDEN	Angier! Let me say good-bye. Please.
JESS	When are you taking me home, Daddy?
BORDEN	Soon. I promise. Soon.
ANGIER	For God's sake, Borden.
BORDEN	Daddy's coming, I promise. I promise.
HERE-
BORDEN	I promise.
BORDEN	You think this place can hold me, Angier?
BORDEN	Angier!
HOUSEKEEPER	Come here, love. Sir, there's gentleman waiting.
CAPTAIN	Dead God.
ANGIER	Hello, Cutter.
CUTTER	You're alive. You're Lord Caldlow. (Angier nods again) How?
ANGIER
	I learned an American accent from-
CUTTER	How are you alive, Robert?! I saw you on the slab, for God's sake.
ANGIER	I magician never reveals his secrets.
HOUSEKEEPER	Go on, child.
ANGIER	Good night, Jess.
CUTTER	Who's the girl?
CUTTER	I've seen her. I've seen her in court with Fallon...
CUTTER	What have you done?
ANGIER	She needs looking after-
CUTTER	She needs her father, but you're letting him hang. And I helped you.
CUTTER	I came here tonight to beg Lord Caldlow to let me destroy that machine. But I won't beg you for anything.
ANGIER	You don't have to. I'm going to make sure the machine. is never used again. A good magician never repeats his tricks.
CUTTER	Then, Lord Caldlow, where would like me to deliver it?
ANGIER	My theatre. It belongs with the Prestige materials.
CUTTER	I once told you about the sailor who described drowing to me...
ANGIER	He said it was like going home.
CUTTER	I was lying. He said it was agony.
BORDEN	We go alone now- both of us. Only I don't have as far to go as you.
BORDEN	You were right. I should've left him to his damned trick... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for so many things. For Sarah. I didn't want to hurt her.
BORDEN	Don't cry. Not for me. Go live your life in full. For both of us.
BORDEN	Are you watching closely?
CUTTER	Thank-you gents.
WORKMAN	Where do you want it?
CUTTER	Don't worry. Someone's coming to help.
CUTTER	I'm bringing this over after we're done.
ANGIER	Cautions as ever, Cutter. No one's going to use the place. I own it.
CUTTER	No room left- you couldn't have acommodated 100 performances.
ANGIER	It's a good thing I retired early then.
ANGIER	We'll put it down the end.
CUTTER	I'll go mix the cement.
CUTTER	Take a minute to consider your achiviement.
ANGIER	Cutter, I tried not to involve you.
ANGIER	No one cares about the man in the box.
ANGIER	Cutter?
WARDEN	Alfred borden, on this day, in the name of the King and the high court of England, you will meet your end. Do you have anything to say for yourself.
BORDEN	Abacadabra.
ANGIER
ANGIER	You- you died.
ANGIER	A brother. A Twin.
ANGIER	You were Fallon. The whole time...
BORDEN	We were both Fallon. And we were both Borden.
ANGIER	Were you the one who went into the
BOX-
ANGIER	Cutter knew. But I told him it was too simple. Too easy.
BORDEN	Simple, maybe. But not easy.
ANGIER	What about Olivia? And your wife?
BORDEN	We each loved one of them. We each had half a full life. Enough for us, but not for them.
BORDEN	Sacrifice, Robert- that's the price of a good trick.
BORDEN	But you wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
ANGIER	I've made sacrificies.
BORDEN	It takes nothing to steal someone else's work.
ANGIER	It takes everything.
ANGIER	It didn't work.
SECOND ANGIER	No, wait! I'm the-
ANGIER	Do you want to see what it cost me? You didn't see where you are, did you? Let me show you.
ANGIER	It took courage to climb into that machine every night...
BORDEN	You went halfway around the world. You spent a fortune. You did terrible things... and all of it for nothing.
ANGIER	Nothing? You never understood, id you? Why we did this? The audience knows the truth- that the world is simple. Miserable. Solid all the way through. But if you could fool them, even for a second, you could make them wonder. Then you got to see something very special... (coughs, looks up) You really don't know?
ANGIER	It was the look on their faced.
CUTTER	But you won't find it...
CUTTER	...because you don't really want to know...
