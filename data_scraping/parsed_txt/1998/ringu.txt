MASAMI	They say that some elementary school  kid spent the night with his parents  at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid wanted to go out and play with everybody,  right, but he didn�t want to miss the  program he always used to watch back in  Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in  their room.  But of course the stations  in Izu are different from the ones in  Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty  channel, so he should�ve recorded nothing but static.  But when the kid  gets back to his house and watches the  tape, all of a sudden this woman comes  on the screen and says-- �One week from now, you will die.� Of course the kid�s completely  freaked, and he stops the video.   Just then the phone rings, and when he  picks it up a voice says-- �You watched it, didn�t you?�  That  same time, exactly one week later...  he�s dead!
MASAMI	What is it, Tomoko?
TOMOKO	Who did you hear that story from?
MASAMI	Who?  It�s just a rumor.  Everybody  knows it.
TOMOKO	Youko told you?
MASAMI	No, it wasn�t Youko...
MASAMI	What�s up with you?
TOMOKO	The other day, I... I watched this  strange video.
MASAMI	Where?
TOMOKO	With Youko and them.
MASAMI	So that�s what I�ve been hearing  about you doing some double-date/ sleepover thing!  So, you and that  guy Iwata, huh?
TOMOKO	No, it�s not like that.  Nothing  happened!
TOMOKO	Iwata... he found this weird video.   Everyone was like, �What�s that?� so  he put it on and we all watched it.
MASAMI	And?  What kind of video was it?
TOMOKO	Just... weird, I can�t really explain  it.  Anyway, right after we finished  watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever it was didn�t say anything, but still...
MASAMI	Jesus.
TOMOKO	rumors. That was one week ago today.
MASAMI  	Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me  out?
TOMOKO	Busted, huh?
MASAMI	Oh, my... I can�t believe you!   You�re terrible!
TOMOKO	Gotcha!
MASAMI	But hang on... you really stayed the night with Youko and Iwata,  right?
MASAMI	So, how far did you and he get?
TOMOKO 	Oh... I can�t remember.
MASAMI	You can�t remember, huh?
MASAMI	Man, you had me freaked me out.
MASAMI	Was it true?
TOMOKO	Masami!
TOMOKO	Masami!
MASAMI	I�ll put her on.
TOMOKO	Yes?
TOMOKO	Oh, man!
TOMOKO	Yeah, I�ve got a friend over now.   Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.
TOMOKO	The game�s gone into overtime, so  they�re gonna be a little late.
TOMOKO	Jeeezus, my parents...
MASAMI	Oh man, I�m tellin� everybody about  this tomorrow!
MASAMI	I�m gonna use your bathroom.  Don�t  go anywhere.
TOMOKO	�K.
ASAKAWA	There seems to be a popular rumor  going around about a �cursed�  videotape.
YOUNG GIRL	Uh-huh.
ASAKAWA 	Have you heard what kind of video  it might be?
YOUNG GIRL	Uh-huh.
KOMIYA	Uh, don�t look right at the camera,
YOUNG GIRL	Sorry.
ASAKAWA	Let�s do it again.
ASAKAWA	Have you heard what kind of video  it might be?
YOUNG GIRL	What I heard was, all of a sudden  this scaaarry lady comes on the screen and says, �In one week, you will die.�
GIRL #2	I heard that if you�re watching TV  late at night it�ll come on, and then your phone�ll ring.
ASAKAWA	Watching TV late at night... do you
GIRL #2	Mmmm... I heard some local station,  around Izu.
ASAKAWA	Izu?
GIRL #2	Mmm-hmm.
ASAKAWA	And, do you know if anyone�s really  died from watching it?
YOUNG GIRL	Well, no one that we know, right?
ASAKAWA	What is it?
GIRL #3	I heard this from a friend of mine  in high school.  She said that there  was this one girl who watched the  video, and then died a week later.   She was out on a drive with her  boyfriend.
ASAKAWA	They were in a wreck?
GIRL #3	No, their car was parked, but they  were both dead inside.  Her  boyfriend died because he�d watched  the video, too.  That�s what my  friend said. It�s true!  It was in the paper two  or three days ago.
ASAKAWA	Do you know the name of the high  school this girl went to?
GIRL #3	No... I heard this from my friend,  and it didn�t happen at her school.   She heard it from a friend at a  different school, she said.
KOMIYA	Mrs. Asakawa?
ASAKAWA	Hm?
KOMIYA	Here you are.
ASAKAWA	Thanks.
KOMIYA	This same kind of thing happened  about ten years ago too, didn�t it?   Some popular young singer committed  suicide, and then suddenly there was  all this talk about her ghost showing up on some music show.
ASAKAWA	But I wonder what this rumor�s all  about. Everyone you ask always  mentions �Izu.�
KOMIYA	Maybe that�s where it all started.   Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake Onna * story from again?
ASAKAWA	Gifu, but there was some big  accident out there, and that ended up being what started the rumor.
KOMIYA	A big accident?
ASAKAWA	Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like  that is going to stay in people�s  minds.  Sometimes the story of what  happened gets twisted around, and  ends up coming back as a rumor like  this one. That�s what they say, at  least.
KOMIYA	D�you think something like that  happened out at Izu?
ASAKAWA	Maybe. Well, anyway, I�m off.  See you tomorrow.
KOMIYA	See you.
GUY IN SUIT	OK, Okazaki, I�m counting on you.
OKAZAKI	Yessir.
OKAZAKI	Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were  going home early today.
ASAKAWA	Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?
OKAZAKI	Sure.
ASAKAWA	Could you check out this article  for me?  Get me some more info.?
OKAZAKI	I guess...
ASAKAWA	Good.  Call me as soon as you know  more, OK?
OKAZAKI	Ma�am.
ASAKAWA 	Yoichi!
ASAKAWA	Sorry I�m late.  Oh, you�ve already  changed.
YOICHI	Yup.  I got your clothes out for you.
ASAKAWA	Aargh, we�ve gotta hurry!
ASAKAWA	Did grandpa call?
YOICHI 	Nope.
YOICHI	Why did Tomo-chan die? *
ASAKAWA	Well... it looks like she was really,  really sick.
ASAKAWA	Will you do me up?
YOICHI	You can die even if you�re young?
ASAKAWA	If it�s something serious... well, yes.
ASAKAWA	As hard as it is for us, what your  auntie and uncle are going through  right now is even harder, so let�s  not talk about this over there, OK?
ASAKAWA	You and her used to play a lot  together, didn�t you?
ASAKAWA	Dad.
KOUICHI	Ah!
ASAKAWA	How is sis holding up?
KOUICHI	She�s resting inside right now.   She�s shaken up pretty badly, you  know.  It�s best she just take  things easy for a while.
ASAKAWA	I�ll go check on auntie and them,  then.
KOUICHI	OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why don�t you sit  here for a little while?
AUNT	Have you heard anything more about  Tomo-chan�s death?
ASAKAWA	No, I...
AUNT	But the police have already finished  their autopsy!
ASAKAWA	Well, they said there was no sign of  foul play.
AUNT	That was no normal death.  They haven�t  once opened the casket to let us see the body.  Don�t you think that�s  strange?
ASAKWAWA 	Yoichi?
ASAKAWA	What are you doing up here?  You shouldn�t just walk into other  people�s rooms.
ASAKAWA	You go on downstairs, OK?
YOICHI	OK.
ASAKAWA	You go on ahead.
YOICHI	�K.
ASAKAWA	Hello?
OKAZAKI	Uh... this is Okazaki.  I�ve got  some more info on that article for you.  The girl was a student of  the uh, Seikei School for Women in  Yokahama City.
ASAKAWA	Thanks.
ASAKAWA	Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a strange question, but by any chance  were you friends of that young girl that died in the car as well?
ASAKAWA	Please.  If you know anything...
GIRL RIGHT	They all died the same day.  Youko.   Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a motorcycle accident.
GIRL LEFT	Because they watched the video.
ASAKAWA	Video?
GIRL LEFT	That�s what Youko said.  They all watched some weird video, and  after that their phone rang.
ASAKAWA	Tomoko-chan watched it, too?   Where?
GIRL LEFT	She just said they all stayed  somewhere.
GIRL RIGHT	There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died.  She�s had to be  hospitalized for shock.
GIRL MIDDLE	They say she won�t go anywhere  near a television.
YOSHINO	The bodies of those found were  Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of  the Seikei School for Women, and  Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory  school student.  Both their doors  were securely locked.
YOSHINO	This is the first time I�ve -ever-  seen something like this.
ASAKAWA	Cause of death?
YOSHINO	Couldn�t say, aside from sudden  heart failure.
ASAKAWA	Drugs?
YOSHINO	The autopsy came up negative.
YOSHINO	These two, about to go at it,  suddenly up and die for no  apparent reason.  Do -you- get it?
RYOMI 	They tell me that Yoichi came to  the funeral, too.
ASAKAWA	Mmm-hmm.
RYOMI	They used to play a lot together, didn�t they?  Upstairs.
ASAKAWA	Yeah...
RYOMI	This... this is where Tomoko died.
RYOMI	Tomoko!
ASAKAWA	Izu...
ASAKAWA	Look, I�m probably going to be late coming home tonight, so just stick  your dinner in the microwave when  you�re ready to eat, OK?
YOICHI	�K... Mom?
ASAKAWA	Hmm?
YOICHI	Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!
ASAKAWA	What did you say?  You are not to  speak of this at school, do you  hear me?
YOICHI	I won�t.  I�m going to school now.
ASAKAWA	There�s no way...
ASAKAWA	"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.   That�s why I�m fat, too."
CLERK	Room for one?
ASAKAWA	Um, actually I�m here on business.
ASAKAWA	They would have stayed here on  August 29th, all four of them.   If there�s any information you  might have...
CLERK	Uh, hang on just a minute.
CLERK	August 29th...
ASAKAWA	That...
CLERK	Hmm?
ASAKAWA	That!  What tape is that?
CLERK	This?  Hmm...
CLERK	Maybe one of the guests left it behind�
ASAKAWA	One week�
RYUJI	Yoichi�s in elementary school  already, is he?
ASAKAWA	His first year.  What about you,  Ryuji?  How have you been  recently?
RYUJI	Same as always.
ASAKAWA	And money is...?
RYUJI	I�m teaching at university.
RYUJI	Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?
ASAKAWA	That�s right.
RYUJI	So if I watch it too, that phone over  there-- --should ring.
ASAKAWA	Ryuji, four people have already  died.  On the same day!
RYUJI	Well, why don�t you try calling  an exorcist?
ASAKAWA	Take my picture.
RYUJI	Turn this way.
ASAKAWA	Hurry up and take it.
RYUJI	It�s over.
RYUJI	Well, it looks like your phone�s not  ringing.
RYUJI	Make me a copy of this, will you?   I�d like to do a little research of my own. There�s no reason to  write us off as dead just yet.  If there�s a video, that means that  somebody had to make it.
ASAKAWA	There�s the guest list from the  cottage to look into... and the  possibility of someone hacking  into the local station�s broadcast  signals.
OKAZAKI	Here�s that guest list you wanted.
ASAKAWA	Oh, thanks.
OKAZAKI	What are you gonna do with this?
ASAKAWA	Uh... sorry, I�m working on  something personal.
RYUJI
RYUJI	Hey.
ASAKAWA
RYUJI	Nothing.
RYUJI	So, what�d you come up with?
ASAKAWA	I don�t think any of the guests on  the list brought the tape with them.   I couldn�t confirm it face-to-face  of course, but even over the phone I  got the feeling they were all being  upfront with me.
ASAKAWA	There�re no traces of any illegal  television signals being broadcast  around Izu.
ASAKAWA	Here�s that copy of the videotape  you wanted.
RYUJI	Asakawa.
RYUJI	Have you ever seen this woman?
ASAKAWA
ASAKAWA	There�s something strange about  this shot.
ASAKAWA	From this angle, the mirror should  be reflecting whoever�s filming.
RYUJI	So, what does that mean?
ASAKAWA	Well, if the person who made this  is a pro, there�d be a way around  that, I guess, but still...
RYUJI	Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?
ASAKAWA	This is gonna be impossible to figure  out on just a regular TV screen,  don�t you think?
RYUJI	Come on in.
RYUJI	Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai. This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.
MAI	Nice to meet you.  I�m Takano.
ASAKAWA	Asakawa. *
MAI	Sensei, the people from the  publishing company called about  the deadline on your thesis again.
RYUJI	What�re they talkin� to you  about it for?
MAI	Because they can never get a  hold of you.
RYUJI	Ask them to wait another week.
MAI	Sensei, ask them yourself,  please.
RYUJI	OK, OK.
RYUJI	This is impossible.
RYUJI	Sada...
RYUJI	Is Yoichi gonna be all right?
ASAKAWA	He�s used to it...
RYUJI	Whoever made this had to have left  some kind of clue behind.  They�re  probably waiting for us to find it.
RYUJI	Wait a minute.
TAPE	Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...   boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...
RYUJI	Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru  zo.  Did you hear that, too?
ASAKAWA	What does that mean?
RYUJI	I�m gonna check it out.
ASAKAWA	Hello?
RYUJI	I�ve got it.  It�s a dialect, just  like I thought.  SHOUMON means  �playing in the water� and BOUKON
ASAKAWA	But, dialect from where?
RYUJI	Oshima.  And the site of our  �eruption� is Mt. Mihara.
ASAKAWA	Yoichi?  I�m gonna be a little  late tonight, honey.
ASAKAWA	You can do it yourself, right?  OK.   Sorry.  Bye.
ASAKAWA	I�ve got it!  This old article...
ASAKAWA	What are you doing?
RYUJI	Has your newspaper got someone out  there at Oshima?
ASAKAWA	I think so.  There should be a  correspondent out there.
RYUJI	I need you to find out, and let me  know how to get hold of him. Tonight.
ASAKAWA	What do you think you�re--?
RYUJI	You�ve only got four days left,  Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact  and I can handle this from here  on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.
YOICHI	Grandpa!
KOUICHI	Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?
ASAKAWA	Yoichi says he�s looking forward to  doing some fishing with you.
KOUICHI	Is that so?
YOICHI	C�mon grandpa, let�s go!
KOUICHI	OK, OK.  We�ll get our things  together and then we can go.
KOUICHI	There he is!  C�mon, there he is,  don�t let him go!
KOUICHI	Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away,  huh?
YOICHI	That was your fault, grandpa.
KOUICHI	Well, whaddya say we try again?
KOUICHI	We�ll get �im this time.
YOICHI	How was work, mommy?
ASAKAWA	Hello?
RYUJI	Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came  through.  It looks like the woman  who predicted the Mihara eruption  is the same woman from the video.
RYUJI	Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She  committed suicide forty years ago  by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.
ASAKAWA	Have you got anything else?
RYUJI 	I�m gonna have to check it for  myself.  I�ll be leaving for  Oshima tomorrow morning.
ASAKAWA	Oshima?  I�ve only got three days  left!
RYUJI	I know.  And I�ve got four.
RYUJI	I�ll be in touch.
KOUJI	What�s happened?
ASAKAWA	Nothing.  I just had some things  left over from work.
TOMOKO 	Auntie?
ASAKAWA	Yoichi?
ASAKAWA	Yoichi!  You brought this with you,  didn�t you?  Why?!?
YOICHI	Tomo-chan...
YOICHI	Tomo-chan told me to watch it.
RYUJI	I should�ve been more careful.   When I was at your place that  day, I could feel something  there.  I thought it was just  because of the video...
ASAKAWA	You mean that Tomoko�
RYUJI	That�s not Tomoko.  Not anymore.
ASAKAWA	Yoichi... he can see them too,  can�t he?
ASAKAWA	It�s all my fault.  First Tomoko  died, then those three others.  It  should have stopped there, but it  didn�t.  Because of me.
RYUJI	I wonder...
ASAKAWA	How did the rumors about the  video even start in the first  place?
RYUJI	This kind of thing... it doesn�t  start by one person telling a  story.  It�s more like everyone�s  fear just takes on a life of its  own.
ASAKAWA	Fear...
RYUJI	Or maybe it�s not fear at all.   Maybe it�s what we were  secretly hoping for all along.
ASAKAWA	Mr. Hayatsu?
HAYATSU	Aah, welcome!  You must be tired  after your long trip.  Please,  this way.
HAYATSU	Back in the old days, the Yamamuras used to head fishing boats out in  Sashikiji, though they don�t much  anymore.  You know, one of Shizuko�s  cousins is still alive. He�s just an  old man now.  His son and his  daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned  inn.  I went ahead and booked  reservations for y�all, hope that�s  alright...
ASAKAWA	Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit  suicide?
RYUJI	She was taking a real beating  in the press, being called a  fraud and all sorts of names.   After a while she just lost it.
RYUJI	Shizuko was getting a lot of  attention around the island after predicting the eruption of Mt.  Mihara.  Seems that for some time  she�d had a rather unique ability: precognition. It was around then that she attracted the attention  of a certain scholar whom you may  have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.
ASAKAWA	He was driven out of the university,  wasn�t he?
RYUJI	This Professor Ikuma convinces  Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him,  where he uses her in a series of  demonstrations meant to prove the  existence of ESP.  At first she�s  the darling of the press, but the  next thing you know they�re  knocking her down, calling her a  fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later, the media still hasn�t changed that much.
ASAKAWA	I�ve heard this story.  But... I�m  sure I remember hearing that somebody  died at one of those demonstrations.
RYUJI	After getting kicked out of  university, Ikuma just vanished,  and no one�s been able to get hold  of him since.  He�s probably not  even alive anymore.
ASAKAWA	But, why even try looking for him?
RYUJI	Because he�s supposed to have had a  child with Shizuko.  A daughter.
HAYATSU	Hello?
KAZUE	Thank you. Welcome.
HAYATSU	Well, I�ll be off then.
KAZUE	Please.
KAZUE	And for your rooms, how shall we...?
RYUJI	Separate, please.
KAZUE	�Sir.
KAZUE	This way.
KAZUE	Sir!
KAZUE	Please, this way.
ASAKAWA	Please!  If you could just answer  a few questions, about Shizuko...
YAMAMURA	I got nuthin� to say.
ASAKAWA	It�s about Shizuko�s daughter.
ASAKAWA	She did have a daughter, didn�t she?
YAMAMURA
RYUJI	Aren�t you gonna eat?
ASAKAWA	Umm...
RYUJI	Hm?
ASAKAWA	You�ll stay with me won�t you?   When it�s time for me to die.
RYUJI	Oh, stop it.
ASAKAWA	You�ll stay, won�t you?  If you  stayed, maybe you�d learn something that could help Yoichi--
RYUJI	I said stop it!  Have you forgotten  There was a girl with Tomoko when  she died?  That girl�s now in a  mental institution.  Who knows what  could happen.
ASAKAWA	But you could stay with me, Ryuji.   You�d be OK.
RYUJI	Why, because I�m already not  right in the head?
RYUJI	If that�s the case, why not just let things run its course, get rid of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a mistake, anyway.
ASAKAWA	Stop it!
RYUJI	We still have two days left...
KAZUE 	Excuse me?
RYUJI	Come in.
KAZUE	It�s about Miss Shizuko.
KAZUE	This is all that there is...
RYUJI	Is this Professor Ikuma?
KAZUE	...yes.  This picture is from before  I�d entered the household.   I should go now.
VOICE	Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...
YAMAMURA	Y�all�d do best to be off soon.   Sea�s probably gonna be rough  tonight.
RYUJI	What kind of a child was Shizuko?
YAMAMURA 	Shizuko was... different.  She�d come  out here by herself ever�day an� just stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen  all took a dislikin� to her.  Ocean�s  an unlucky place for us, y�see: every  year it swallows up more of our own.  You keep starin� out at somethin�  ike that...
RYUJI	kuru zo.  �If you keep playing in the  water, the monster will come for you.�
RYUJI	Shizuko could see �inside� people,  couldn�t she?  Down to the places  they�d most like to keep hidden.  It  must have been difficult for her...
YAMAMURA
RYUJI	I�ve got a little of that ability  myself.  It was you who spread the  word about Shizuko, wasn�t it?   And you who first contacted  Professor Ikuma?
YAMAMURA	What�re you--?
RYUJI	You thought you�d be able to make  some money off her.  You even got  some, from one of the newspapers.
YAMAMURA	Leave me the hell alone!
RYUJI	Tell us about Shizuko�s daughter.   Who was she?
YAMAMURA	I don�t know!
RYUJI	She was there, with Shizuko. She  had to be.
RYUJI	You were there!
RYUJI 	You stood there and watched the  demonstration.
JUDGE	Match.
JUDGE	Match.
REPORTER	Faker!  This is nothing but trickery,  and the lowest form of trickery at  that.
REPORTER	What are you trying to pull, woman?
REPORTER #2	That�s right!  Professor Ikuma,  you�re being fooled!
REPORTER #3	What�s happened?
REPORTER #4	He�s dead!
REPORTER #5	Witch!
SHIZUKO	Sadako?  Was it you?
RYUJI	Sadako?!
RYUJI	Sadako killed him?  She can kill  just with a thought?
YAMAMURA	She�s... a devil spawn.
ASAKAWA	That�s right. After Yamamura Shizuko  committed suicide, Professor Ikuma took the daughter and ran.  No, no one knows where they went.  That�s why I  need -you- to find out where they are.   Even if the professor�s dead, Sadako  should still be in her forties.  I�ll  explain it all later, but right now  just hurry!
RYUJI	Sadako�s probably already dead.  She could kill people with just a thought,  remember?  Her mother wasn�t even  close to that.
ASAKAWA	Well, what about that video?  If  Sadako�s dead then who made it?
RYUJI	Nobody made it. It wasn�t made at  all. That video... is the pure,  physical manifestation of Sadako�s  hatred.
RYUJI	We�ve been cursed.
HAYATSU	It�s no good.  With the typhoon  coming in, all ships are  temporarily staying docked.
RYUJI	What about the fishing boats?   Tell their captains I�ll pay.
HAYATSU	Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing  whether this typhoon is going to hit  us or not, I think it�d be better to  wait and see how things turn--
RYUJI	Fine!  I�ll try searching myself!
HAYATSU	Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...
ASAKAWA	Hello?
OKAZAKI 	Mrs. Asakawa?  I�m sorry.  I tried,  but I couldn�t come up with any  leads at all.
OKAZAKI 	Hello?
ASAKAWA	Thank you...
ASAKAWA	Yoichi...
ASAKAWA 	Izu...
ASAKAWA	Ryuji!
ASAKAWA	Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment  never rang!  It only ever rang at the rental cottage!  Professor  Ikuma must�ve...
RYUJI	And we�ve got no way of going back.
HAYATSU	It�s too dangerous!  The thought of  anybody going out in this weather...
YAMAMURA 	I�ll take you out.
YAMAMURA	Sadako is callin� y�all, reckon.   Mayhap to drag you down under the  water.
RYUJI	Please.  Take us out.
ASAKAWA	It�s funny.  I�m not afraid at all.
RYUJI	Sadako probably died back out there at Izu, before the rental cottages  were ever built.
ASAKAWA	So, Sadako was Professor Ikuma�s  daughter?
RYUJI	Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.   His relationship with Shizuko was  already a scandal, and one of the  reasons he got drummed out of the  university... We�ve gotta find  Sadako�s body.
ASAKAWA	Is that going to break the curse?   Will Yoichi be all right?
RYUJI	It�s all we�ve got left to try.
ASAKAWA	Just one more day...
RYUJI	We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesn�t  have it out for us after all.
YAMAMURA	Shizuko... she used to -speak- to  the ocean, just ramble away.  One  time I hid, listenin� to one of her  conversations. And it weren�t in no human language.
YOICHI 	Hello?
ASAKAWA	Yoichi?  It�s mommy.  I just called  to say I�ll be coming home tomorrow.
YOICHI 	I�m tired of it here, mom!  I wanna go back to school.
ASAKAWA	Yoichi, it�s rude to your grandpa  to talk like that.
YOICHI 	He�s laughing.  You wanna talk to him?
ASAKAWA	No, that�s...
ASAKAWA	I�m sorry, Yoichi.  I�ll... I�ll  see you tomorrow.
YOICHI	What�s wrong?
ASAKAWA	Mommy�s got something she has to do.   Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?
RYUJI	What time was it when you first  watched the video?
ASAKAWA	Seven or eight minutes past  seven.  PM.  No more than ten  minutes past.
RYUJI	If the rumors are true, that  time is gonna be our deadline.
RYUJI	-Here-.
RYUJI	I knew it!  The well.
ASAKAWA	The well...
ASAKAWA	Her own father!
RYUJI	It was Ikuma who put this lid on.   And Sadako�s still inside.
RYUJI	I�ll go.
RYUJI	climb her way out.
RYUJI	Lower the buckets!
RYUJI	Take it up!
RYUJI	Take it up!
ASAKAWA	It�s already six!
RYUJI	I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!
RYUJI
RYUJI	Asakawa!
RYUJI	What the hell are you doing?  Trying  to get me killed?
RYUJI 	Hey!
RYUJI	Asakawa!
RYUJI	We�ll change.  You�re in no condition  to keep this up.
ASAKAWA:	No!
RYUJI	Who do you expect to pull up these  buckets, then?
ASAKAWA	But, we don�t even know if it�s doing  any good...
RYUJI	And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his mother not coming to pick him up  after all?
RYUJI	Don�t look down!
ASAKAWA	Where are you?  Please, come out.
ASAKAWA	Please.  Where are you?
ASAKAWA	It�s you...
RYUJI	Hey!  Asakawa!  It�s already 10  minutes past seven!  We did it!
ASAKAWA	Why would Ikuma have killed her?   His own daughter...
RYUJI	Maybe she wasn�t his daughter at all.
ASAKAWA	What?
RYUJI	Maybe her father... wasn�t even human.
RYUJI	It�s gone...
RYUJI	Enough, already.  It�s over.  C�mon.   I�ll take you home.
RYUJI	Get some rest.   I still have a thesis to finish.
ASAKAWA	...thank you.
RYUJI	That girl...
RYUJI	Why?!
RYUJI	That�s it!  Asakawa...
RYUJI	Aaargh!
GUARD	Are you a resident here, ma�am?
ASAKAWA	I�m Takayama Ryuji�s wife!
GUARD	I�m sorry ma�am, but they�ve already  taken the body away.
ASAKAWA	What happened?
MAI	When I got here he was just  lying there...
ASAKAWA	Did he say anything to you?  About  a videotape?
MAI	His face...
ASAKAWA	Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse  not broken yet?
ASAKAWA	I was the only one to break  Sadako�s curse.  Ryuji... why...?   Something I did that you didn�t...   Something I did that you didn�t...
ASAKAWA	Ryuji?!
ASAKAWA	Something I did that you didn�t...
ASAKAWA	What broke the curse was that I copied  the tape and showed it to someone else!
ASAKAWA	It�s for Yoichi...
GIRL A 	They say there�s a way you can stay  alive after you watch the video.   You�ve gotta make a copy of it, and  show it to somebody else inside a week.
GIRL B 	But what about the person you show it  to?
GIRL A 	Well, then they make a copy and show it  to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.
GIRL C 	Then there�s no end to it.
GIRL A 	That�s just it.  There -is- no end.  But  if it meant not dying... you�d do it,  wouldn�t you?
