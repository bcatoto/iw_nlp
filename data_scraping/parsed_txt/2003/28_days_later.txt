CHIEF ACTIVIST	Fucking hell...
FEMALE ACTIVIST	Oh God...
CHIEF ACTIVIST	(to Female Activist) Keep your shit together. If we're going to get them out of here...
FINNISH ACTIVIST	I can pop these, no problem.
CHIEF ACTIVIST	So get to it.
SCIENTIST	Security! We have a break-in! Get to sector...
SCIENTIST	...nine.
SCIENTIST	I know who you are, I know what you think you're doing, but you have to listen to me. You can't release these animals.
CHIEF ACTIVIST	If you don't want to get hurt, shut your mouth, and don't move a fucking muscle.
SCIENTIST	The chimps are infected! 
SCIENTIST	(continuing; stumbling,
FLUSTERED)	These animals are highly contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.
CHIEF ACTIVIST	Infected with what?
SCIENTIST	Chemically restricted, locked down to a... a single impulse that...
CHIEF ACTIVIST	Infected with what?
SCIENTIST	Rage.
SCIENTIST	(desperately trying to
EXPLAIN)	In order to cure, you must first understand. Just imagine: to have power over all the things we feel we can't control. Anger, violence...
FINNISH ACTIVIST	What the fuck is he talking about?
CHIEF ACTIVIST	We don't have time for this shit! Get the cages open!
SCIENTIST	No!
CHIEF ACTIVIST	We're going, you sick bastard, and we're taking your torture victims with us.
SCIENTIST	NO! You must listen! The animals are contagious! The infection is in their blood and saliva! One bite and...
FEMALE ACTIVIST	They won't bite me.
SCIENTIST	STOP! You have no idea!
FEMALE ACTIVIST	Good boy. You don't want to bite me, do you?
SCIENTIST	NO!
FEMALE ACTIVIST	Get it off! Get if off!
FEMALE ACTIVIST	I'm burning! Jesus! Help me!
SCIENTIST	We have to kill her!
FEMALE ACTIVIST	I'm burning! I'm burning!
CHIEF ACTIVIST	What's...
SCIENTIST	We have to kill her NOW!
CHIEF ACTIVIST	What's wrong with them?
SCIENTIST	Oh God.
ACTIVIST	Terry? Jemma?
ACTIVIST	Mika? Where are you?
ACTIVIST	Bloody hell.
28 DAYS LATER
JIM	Ow...
JIM	Hello?
JIM	...Hello?
JIM	Father?
JIM	Father, what are you...
JIM	Jesus!
JIM	Oh, that, was bad, that was bad... I shouldn't have done that...
JIM	Shit.
WOMAN'S VOICE	HERE!
WOMAN'S VOICE	OVER HERE!
JIM	Those people! Who were... who...
MARK	This way! Move it!
MARK	A man walks into a bar with a giraffe. They each get pissed. The giraffe falls over. The man goes to leave and the barman says, you can't leave that lying there. The man says, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe.
MARK	He's completely humorless. You two will get along like a house on fire.
SELENA	Who are you? You've come from a hospital.
MARK	Are you a doctor?
SELENA	He's not a doctor. He's a patient.
JIM	I'm a bicycle courier. I was riding a package from Farringdon to Shaftesbury Avenue. A car cut across me... and then I wake up in hospital, today... I wake up and I'm hallucinating, or...
MARK	What's your name?
JIM	Jim.
MARK	I'm Mark. This is Selena. Okay, Jim. We've got some bad news.
SELENA	It began as rioting. And right from the beginning, you knew something bad was going on because the rioters were killing people. And then it wasn't on the TV anymore. It was in the street outside. It was coming through your windows. We all guessed it was a virus. An infection. You didn't need a doctor to tell you that. It was the blood.
JIM	Where are your families?
MARK	They're dead.
SELENA	Yours will be dead too.
JIM	No... No! I'm going to find them. They live in Greenwich. I can walk. (heading for the exit) I'm going to... to go and...
SELENA	You'll go and come back.
JIM	(pulling at the grill) Yes! I'll go and come back.
MARK	Rules of survival. Lesson one - you never go anywhere alone, unless you've got no choice. Lesson two - you only move during daylight, unless you've got no choice. We'll take you tomorrow. Then we'll all go and find your dead parents. Okay?
MARK	How's your head? Fucked?
MARK	(gesturing at the city) I know where your head is. You're looking at these windows, these millions of windows, and you're thinking - there's no way this many people are dead. It's just too many windows.
MARK	The person who owned this bag. Can't be dead.
MARK	A woman - (car keys) - who drove a Nissan Micra - (teddy) - and had a little teddy bear - (condoms) - and carried protection, just in case.
MARK	Believe me, we won't need them anymore than she will.
MARK	Hey!
JIM	Down there. Westlink Street. Second on the left.
SELENA	If there's anyone in there who isn't human...
JIM	I understand.
SELENA	Anyone.
JIM	I understand.
MARK	Okay.
MARK	Wait.
SELENA	They died peacefully. You should be grateful.
JIM	I'm not grateful.
MARK	The roads out were all jammed. So we went to Paddington Station. Hoping: maybe we could get to Heathrow, maybe buy our way on a plane. My dad had all this cash, even though cash was already useless, and Mum had her jewellery. But twenty thousand other people had the same idea. The crowd was surging, and I lost my grip on my sister's hand. I remember realizing the ground was soft. I looked down, and I was standing on people. Like a carpet, people who had fallen, and... somewhere in the crowd there were infected. It spread fast, no one could run, all you could do was climb. Over more people. So I did that. I got up, somehow, on top of a kiosk. Looking down, you couldn't tell which faces were infected and which weren't. With the blood, the screaming, they all looked the same. And I saw my dad. Not my mum or my sister. But I saw my dad. His face.
MARK	Selena's right. You should be grateful.
SELENA	We don't have time to get back to the shop before dark. We should stay here tonight.
JIM	My old room was at the end of the landing. You two take it. I'll sleep down here.
SELENA	We'll sleep in the same room. It's safer.
JIM'S DAD	Give me a glass of that, would you?
JIM	(draining the carton, and giving it a shake) It's empty.
JIM	Help!
JIM	It's Mr. Bridges...
SELENA	Were you bitten?
JIM	He lives four doors down...
JIM	That's his daughter...
SELENA	Were you bitten?
JIM	No... No! I wasn't!
SELENA	Did any of the blood get in your mouth?
JIM	No!
SELENA	Mark?
MARK	Wait.
MARK	DON'T!
SELENA	Get that cleaned off.
SELENA	Do you have any clothes here?
JIM	(fazed, frightened of her) I... I don't know. I think so.
SELENA	Then get them. And get dressed. We have to leave, now.
SELENA	More infected will be coming. They always do.
JIM	How did you know?
JIM	How did you know he was infected?
SELENA	The blood.
JIM	The blood was everywhere. On me, on you, and...
SELENA	I didn't know he was infected. Okay? I didn't know. He knew. I could see it in his face. You need to understand, if someone gets infected, you've got somewhere between ten and twenty seconds to kill them. They might be your brother or your sister or your oldest friend. It makes no difference Just so as you know, if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.
JIM	How long had you known him?
SELENA	Five days. Or six. Does it matter?
SELENA	He was full of plans. Long-distance weapons, so they don't get close. A newsagent's with a metal grill, so you can sleep. Petrol bombs, so the blood doesn't splash.
SELENA	Got a plan yet, Jim? You want us to find a cure and save the world? Or fall in love and fuck?
SELENA	Plans are pointless. Staying alive is as good as it gets.
SELENA	Shhh.
JIM	Let's hope we don't have to get out of here in a hurry.
SELENA	Need a break?
JIM	(completely out of breath) No. You?
SELENA	No.
JIM	I do need a break, by the way.
SELENA	What's up?
JIM	Nothing.
JIM	I've got a headache.
SELENA	Bad?
JIM	Pretty bad.
SELENA	Why didn't you say something before?
JIM	Because I didn't think you'd give a shit.
SELENA	(going through the bag) You've got no fat on you, and all you've had to eat is sugar. So you're crashing. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot we can do about that...
SELENA	...except pump you full painkillers, and give you more sugar to eat.
SELENA	As for the sugar: Lilt or Tango?
JIM	...Do you have Sprite?
SELENA	Actually, I did have a can of Sprite, but...
JIM	Jesus!
SELENA	Quiet.
SELENA	That's an infected.
SELENA	They're in.
SELENA	Come on!
JIM	(out of breath, barely able to speak) I can't.
MAN	Down the corridor! Flat 157!
SELENA	Let us in!
GIRL	Where's Dad?
MAN	It's okay, Hannah. Let them inside.
MAN	Come in, come in.
MAN	So... I'm Frank, anyway.
JIM	I'm Jim.
SELENA	Selena.
FRANK	Jim and Selena. Good to meet you. And this is my daughter, Hannah. (turning to Hannah) ...Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.
FRANK	So... so this is great. Just great. It calls for a celebration.
HANNAH	We've got Mum's creme de menthe.
FRANK	Yes, her creme de menthe. Great. Look, sit, please. Get comfortable. Sit tight while I get it.
SELENA	Shall we?
HANNAH	Middle cupboard.
HANNAH	Top cupboard.
JIM	This is your place, then.
JIM	It's nice.
FRANK	There! I know it isn't much but... well, cheers!
FRANK	Normally we keep the windows covered at night, because the light attracts them. But when we saw your petrol station fire, we knew it had to be survivors... So we hooked up the Christmas tree lights. Like a beacon.
SELENA	We're grateful.
FRANK	Well, we're grateful you came. I was starting to really worry. Like I say, we haven't seen any sign of anyone normal for a while now.
JIM	There aren't any others in the building?
SELENA	And you haven't seen any people outside?
FRANK	We haven't left the block for more than two weeks. Stayed right here. Only sensible thing to do. Everyone who went out...
SELENA	Didn't come back.
FRANK	And there's two hundred flats here. Most of them have a few cans of food, or cereal, or something.
SELENA	It's a good set-up.
FRANK	It isn't bad.
FRANK	We've got by, haven't we?
JIM	Yes. Fine.
FRANK	Have to empty it each morning. We just chuck it over the balcony... No mod cons here.
JIM	It's fine.
FRANK	...Well, look, it's pretty late. I'm going to turn in. We've got a spare room. Are you and Selena...?
JIM	I'll take the living room.
FRANK	Oh, right. I mean, yes... So, good night then, anyway.
JIM	Good night, Frank.
SELENA	Very spruce.
JIM	Very shredded.
SELENA	Uh-huh.
JIM	So what do you make of them?
SELENA	They're desperate. Probably need us more than we need them.
JIM	...I think they're good people.
SELENA	Good people?
JIM	Yeah.
SELENA	Well, that's nice. But you should be more concerned about whether they're going to slow you down.
JIM	Right. Because if they slowed you down...
SELENA	I'd leave them behind.
JIM	In a heartbeat.
SELENA	Yeah.
JIM	I wouldn't.
SELENA	Then you're going to wind up getting yourself killed.
SELENA	I'm going to get some sleep.
JIM	Selena - you think I don't get it. But I do get it. And I know I'd be dead already if I hadn't met you.
SELENA	Sure.
JIM	No, look - I mean thank you.
SELENA	And I mean sure. Good night, Jim.
JIM	Good night.
FRANK	Morning, Jim.
JIM	Morning.
FRANK	Listen, have you got a minute?
FRANK	We lost water pressure three weeks ago. For a while, I thought we'd be okay with the water in the other flats. The cistern and tanks. But it vanishes so quick you wouldn't believe. You drink it, it evaporates, turns stagnant...
JIM	(looking at the pans) They're all empty...
FRANK	It hasn't rained in over a week.
FRANK	You can set up a plastic sheet to catch dew and condensation. Trap it somehow. I saw it on TV once and I've been experimenting, but I can't get it to work, and... you don't happen to...
FRANK	You'd never think it. Needing rain so badly... Not in fucking England... (he breaks off) Jim, we don't have enough water for and Selena.
JIM	Right.
FRANK	No. It's not what you think.
SELENA	There haven't been any broadcasts for weeks.
FRANK	Just listen.
SELENA	Soldiers.
FRANK	There's more. Listen.
FRANK	Then it just repeats.
JIM	It's a recording?
FRANK	It's a recording. But this is where it's telling us to go.
JIM	The North...
FRANK	The way things are, we might need two or three days to get up there.
SELENA	We.
FRANK	Sound carries in this flat. Jerry- built, I suppose, and... me and Hannah do need you more than you need us.
SELENA	I wasn't -
FRANK	It's okay. Look, it's the truth. I can't leave the block if it's just the two of us.
SELENA	If it's a recording, for all we know the soldiers who made it are dead.
FRANK	Yes. It's possible.
SELENA	And that stuff about the answer to infection. There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.
JIM	Maybe they've got a cure.
SELENA	Maybe they've got nothing at all.
FRANK	The only way to find out is to reach them.
SELENA	We could die trying.
HANNAH	Or die here.
HANNAH	And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said. You need us just the same as we need you. We need each other. And we'll never be safe in the cities, and soldiers could keep us safe.
HANNAH	So we have to try and get there.
JIM	Get there how?
FRANK	Just so as you know. I don't take cheques or credit cards.
FRANK	What do you think?
SELENA	It's the most direct route to the other side of the river.
JIM	Then we should go the indirect route. The one in broad daylight. That isn't underground.
FRANK	Let's just get it done.
JIM	I knew this was a shit idea. You know why? Because it was really obviously a shit idea. Driving into a dark tunnel, full of smashed cars and broken glass is really fucking obviously a shit idea.
JIM	Oh no.
FRANK	HOLD ON!
FRANK	Fuck.
JIM	The world's worst place to get a flat.
FRANK	Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.
FRANK	You know what to do.
JIM	...You heard that?
FRANK	(from the front of the
CAB)	Heard what?
JIM	Holy shit.
FRANK	(as the rats rush around
THEM)	What the fuck?
SELENA	They're running from the infected.
FRANK	Hannah, get out, get out! (to Jim and Selena) Just lift it! LIFT IT!
SELENA	(straining with the
WEIGHT)	Come on!
HANNAH	Almost there!
FRANK	Go! Go!
JIM	(at the Infected) Fuck you!
FRANK	Honey, you're a cab driver's daughter.
SELENA	Whoa! Stop the cab! Stop the cab!
SELENA	Un. Believable.
JIM	You're getting out?
SELENA	This place hasn't been looted. It's a gold mine.
HANNAH	But we don't know what's in there.
SELENA	Food and drink is what's in there. And we need it.
JIM	Wait!
SELENA	I've been living off Mars Bars and Coke for two weeks. I need some tinned fruit.
SELENA	Let's shop.
SELENA	I'll have you, you, you, you...
SELENA	Don't take anything we need to cook.
JIM	It's okay. I think you can eat this stuff raw.
FRANK	Mmm. Irradiated.
SELENA	Ugh. If I never see chocolate again, it'll be too soon.
SELENA	Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange, of course.
HANNAH	(taking a handful of
YORKIE BARS)	Or Yorkies.
SELENA	Or Yorkies, obviously.
FRANK	Put that back. We can't just take any crap.
JIM	It isn't any crap. It's whisky. It might be good to have.
FRANK	Who's arguing about whisky? I'm saying, don't get a cheap blend.
FRANK	Single malt. Eighteen-year-old. Dark, full flavor.
FRANK	Warm, but not aggressive. Peaty after taste.
SELENA	We could have a problem here.
JIM	Jesus Christ. We're never going to be able to get out of London.
FRANK	Don't you worry about that. I've sat twenty years in this seat. I've got my routes.
FRANK	Okay. We either do this now, or we're walking.
FRANK	If anything goes wrong, you just drive. You put your foot down. And go as far as you can.
FRANK	You hear me, Hannah?
HANNAH	Yes, Dad.
SELENA	Stay close, Jim.
JIM	...What?
SELENA	You heard.
SELENA	Where are you going?
SELENA	We've got enough food.
JIM	We don't have any cheeseburgers. "Stay close." It's like going on holiday with your fucking aunt.
SELENA	Find anything.
SELENA	Find anything, Jim?
JIM	No.
FRANK	Okay. We're done.
HANNAH	(leaning out of the
WINDOW)	I am a cab driver's daughter.
FRANK	You're Ayrton Senna's bloody daughter.
JIM	Who's unbelievably hungry?
ALL	Me.
JIM	Let's have a picnic.
SELENA	Oh my God, yes. I can taste the vitamin C. I can feel it in my blood.
JIM	(cracking a bun in half) These are great. They're like huge biscuits.
HANNAH	It's true. They are like biscuits.
JIM
(COMPLETELY	unintelligible, mouth full, spraying crumbs) An de phraisins ar phrill moipht.
HANNAH	What did you say?
JIM	I said, the raisins are still moist.
FRANK	Hey.
FRANK	Look over there.
HANNAH	Do you think they're infected?
FRANK	No. I think they're doing just fine.
JIM	You know what I was thinking?
SELENA	You were thinking that you'll never hear another piece of original music ever again. You'll never read a book that isn't already written. Or see a film that isn't already shot.
JIM	That's what you were thinking.
SELENA	No... I was thinking I was wrong.
JIM	About what?
SELENA	All the death, all the shit - it doesn't really mean anything for Frank and Hannah. Because she's got her dad, and he's got his daughter, so... it's okay.
SELENA	(looking back at Jim) I was wrong when I told you that staying alive is as good as it gets.
JIM	That's what I was thinking.
SELENA	...Was it?
JIM	Uh-huh. You stole my thought.
SELENA	(smiling back at Jim) Sorry.
JIM	(slightly surprised, but
PLEASED)	Ah, keep it.
FRANK	It's getting late. We should stay here the night.
HANNAH	Can't sleep.
JIM	Nor can I. It doesn't feel safe, outdoors like this.
FRANK	I think we're safe enough.
HANNAH	...Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.
JIM	I know. I noticed that too. (reaching over and shaking
SELENA'S SHOULDER)	Selena...Selena!
SELENA	What... what is it...
JIM	How did you manage to get to sleep?
FRANK	Bloody hell. You must have needed a hell of a prescription for that lot.
SELENA	I didn't need a prescription. I'm a qualified chemist.
JIM	(inspecting the bottle) Valium. Great. Not only will it get us to sleep, but if we get attacked during the night, we won't even care. (pops the lid) Two each?
FRANK	Not for me, thanks.
JIM	What about...?
HANNAH	Can I, Dad?
FRANK	I don't know, honey.
HANNAH	Da-ad, plee-ease. I can't sleep.
FRANK	All right, all right. Give her half of one.
THE DRIVER	You stupid cunt!
JIM	Fuck you!
FRANK	Hey.
JIM	(confused, semi-conscious) What...
FRANK	Shh. You're having a bad dream, that's all.
JIM	(mumbled, half-asleep
ALREADY)	Okay, Dad.
JIM	Here you go, Frank. This is how you catch dew. I'm covered in the fucking stuff.
FRANK	(packing the spare away) Okay. Let's get rolling. (he checks his watch) If we make good time, we'll be there before midday.
JIM	Bloody hell...
FRANK	It must be Manchester.
JIM	But, the whole of Manchester. The whole city...
SELENA	No fire crews to put it out.
JIM	It can't be...
HANNAH	Is it snow?
FRANK	(hitting the windscreen
WIPERS)	It's ash.
FRANK	Okay, everyone. I think this is it.
JIM	Try the horn.
SELENA	Don't. We might attract the wrong kind of attention.
FRANK	What do you think?
JIM	It looks deserted.
SELENA	Or overrun.
FRANK	Let's check it out.
HANNAH	I don't understand. Did they leave?
JIM	They didn't all leave.
SELENA	I don't like this. I think we should go.
FRANK	No! The vehicles. We should check the vehicles first. There has to be something...
FRANK	Nothing. Nothing here. I can't believe it.
SELENA	Frank.
FRANK	"We should go."
SELENA	Yes.
FRANK	Go fucking where? What the fuck are we supposed to do? How is this going to fucking end? It's never going to -
FRANK	(under his breath) Get out it. GET OUT OF IT!
HANNAH	Dad... are you okay?
FRANK	I... I'm fine, honey. I'm sorry. I just lost my temper. I...
HANNAH	...What?
FRANK	Hannah...
FRANK	Get away from me.
HANNAH	...Dad?
FRANK	Get away from me! Get her away from me!
HANNAH	(moving to Frank) Why? What's...
FRANK	GET AWAY FROM ME!
SELENA	Jim... (breaking into a run) Jim, he's infected!
HANNAH	No! No!
SELENA	(holding Hannah back) Jim!
HANNAH	Dad!
SELENA	Jim!
SELENA	KILL HIM!
HANNAH	...Dad?
CLIFTON	STAY AWAY FROM HIM!
FARRELL	Get away from the man! NOW!
SELENA	Jesus.
HENRY	I'm Major Henry West. Welcome. We've got beds with clean sheets and a boiler that produces hot water. So you can all have a shower. You look like you need one.
HENRY	You heard our broadcast.
JIM	Yes.
HENRY	We must be a disappointment. You were hoping for a full brigade. An army base, with helicopters and field hospitals.
JIM	We were hoping for...
HENRY	The answer to infection. Well, as I said, it's here. Though it may not be quite what you imagined.
JIM	I didn't know what to imagine, so... We just feel lucky to have found you.
HENRY	You were lucky. The fire drove hundreds of infected out of Manchester. The surrounding area is teeming with them.
HENRY	But there's no need for you to worry. We're well protected here.
HENRY	Three-sixty visibility. Flat terrain all around the house... Floodlights, which we've rigged up to a generator. Don't like to waste the fuel, but when we want to, we can turn night into day.
HENRY	High perimeter wall, which helps, and we've been lacing the grounds with trip wires and land mines.
HENRY	You wouldn't want to go mowing the lawn, but if they get in, we hear them.
HENRY	Secondary to protection, our real job is to rebuild. Start again. Down here is the wood-fired boiler that provides us with hot water. Our first step to civilization.
HENRY	And here, the kitchen.
HENRY	What are you cooking, Jones?
JONES	It's a surprise, sir!
HENRY	And finally...
HENRY	...meet Mailer.
HENRY	Mailer, Jim. Jim, Mailer. Got infected three days ago. Mitchell managed to knock him out cold. Got a chain around his neck.
JIM	You're keeping him alive?
HENRY	The idea was to learn something about infection. Have him teach me.
JIM	And has he?
HENRY	In a way. He's teaching me he'll never bake bread. Plant crops, raise livestock. He's telling me he's futureless. And eventually he'll tell me how long the infected take to starve to death.
HENRY	Dinner's at seven. Don't forget to tell the girls.
JIM	...So how is she?
SELENA	She's lost her dad. That's how she is. It's all fucked, Jim.
JIM	Hey, don't...do that. Look, Hannah... Hannah's what Frank said she was. Tough. Strong. And just like me, just like you, she will cope...
SELENA	Shut up, Jim. Just shut up. I don't want her to fucking cope. I want her to be okay. And when Hannah had her dad, it was all okay. Remember? And when it was okay for them, it was okay for us. And now it's all fucked.
HENRY	So, what have we here? Tinned ham, tinned peas, and omelette. You've prepared a feast, Jones.
JONES	Honor of our guests, sir.
HENRY	Absolutely. I was going to suggest a toast, but this omelette will do just as well. (cuts off a chunk of omelette and raises it) To new friends.
HENRY	Jones, did you notice while cooking that these eggs are off?
JONES	I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.
HENRY	(pushing his plate away) Get rid of it.
HENRY	I don't suppose you can cook, can you? I can't tell you how badly we need someone who shows a little flair in the kitchen.
DAVIS	That's a fucking disappointment. When I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.
BELL	We'll have eggs again. Once everything's back to normal.
MITCHELL	Listen to him! He's still waiting for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.
FARRELL	I think Bell's got a point. If you look at the whole life of the planet, man has only been around for a few blinks of an eye. So if the infection wipes us all out, that is a return to normality.
FARRELL	Is that what you meant, Bell?
BELL	Uh...yeah.
HENRY	(to Jim and Selena) Have you met our new-age sergeant? Remind me, Farrell, why exactly did you join the army in the first place.
HENRY	This is what I've seen in the four weeks since infection. People killing people. Which is much what I saw in the four weeks before infection, and the four weeks before that, and before that, as far back as I care to remember... People killing people. Which to my mind puts us in a state of normality right now.
SELENA	You're not eating.
HANNAH	I don't want to eat.
HENRY	You must eat, Hannah.
HANNAH	I don't want to eat. I want to bury my dad. He's one of the people you're talking about.
FARRELL	Stand to!
MITCHELL	Go, go, go!
FARRELL	Jones! Cover right!
SMITH	Three o'clock! Three o'clock!
MITCHELL	That was mad! Did you see that! That was fucking mad!
FARRELL	Clear!
JONES	Clear.
MITCHELL	Clear. Fuck me, I never saw that before. Keeled over and - bam! Gone, like fucking magic.
SMITH	I drew a lovely bead. One shot. Right between its eyes.
MITCHELL	It was all hanging in the air, and all these bits coming down, and...
MITCHELL	Hello.
MITCHELL	I'll tell you what: you don't need this penknife any more, sweetie. I'm here to protect you now. (winks at the other
SOLDIERS)	But listen, if you want to hold a huge chopper...
MITCHELL	Whoa! Feisty!
SELENA	Fuck you!
MITCHELL	You bet. How about right now?
MITCHELL	Yeah! A little rough stuff!
FARRELL	MITCHELL!
JIM
(ANGRILY GRABBING
MITCHELL)	Cut it out!
MITCHELL	(grabbing Jim, propelling him back across the room, up against a wall) Easy, tiger. You don't want to go picking a fight with me.
MITCHELL	(gasping, on the ground) Ahh, you cunt. Cunt.
HENRY	Corporal, first point of order after an attack.
MITCHELL	Re-secure the perimeter, sir.
HENRY	Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him. Sergeant.
FARRELL	Sir.
HENRY	Clear the bodies off the lawn. The rest of you go with him.
HENRY	My apologies.
HENRY	Drink?
JIM	Look. We're grateful. Very grateful for your protection, and just to have found other people. But if we're going to stay here with you, you're going to have to stop your men from -
HENRY	Who have you killed?
JIM	I haven't killed anyone.
HENRY	Since it began, who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive now if you hadn't killed somebody.
JIM	A boy. I killed a boy.
HENRY	A child?
JIM	Yes.
HENRY	But you had to. Otherwise he'd have killed you. Survival. I understand. I promised them women.
JIM	What?
HENRY	Eight days ago I found Jones with his gun in this mouth. He said he was going to kill himself because there was no future. What could I say to him? We kill all the infected or wait until they starve to death. And then what? What do nine men do except wait to die themselves? I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio broadcasting, and I promised them women. Because women mean children.
HENRY	And children mean a future.
JIM	Get up. Get up!
SELENA	Wha...
JIM	We've got to get out of here!
SELENA	But we...
JIM	(hauling them up) We're leaving. Now! NOW!
FARRELL	You can't do this! You can't do this! Get back! I'll fucking slot you! I'll slot you, I fucking swear it!
HENRY	I want to give you a chance. You can be with us, or not.
HENRY	Okay, Jim. Okay.
HENRY	Him too.
FARRELL'S VOICE	He's insane.
FARRELL	You know what they're doing, a few hundred miles from here? Across the channel, across the Atlantic, they're eating dinner. They're wondering what to watch on TV tonight. They're sleeping next to their wives.
FARRELL	But we're here, chained to a fucking radiator because the OC has gone insane. Starting the world again when the rest of the world hasn't even fucking stopped. Think about it! How could infection cross the oceans? How could it cross the mountains and the rivers? They stopped it. And right now TVs are playing and planes are flying in the sky and the world is continuing as fucking normal. Think. Actually think about it. What would you do with a diseased little island?
FARRELL	They quarantined us.
FARRELL	There is no infection. It's just people killing people. He's insane.
JIM	... Quarantine?
FARRELL	Come on then, you fucking pansies. Do me first.
FARRELL	So you're going to stick me, Mitchell? Is that it? Is that how you're going to let your sergeant go out, Jones?
JONES	No, Mitch. Do it with the gun.
FARRELL	You're going to let him stick me, are you? Like a fucking dog?
JONES	Mitch, come on. Just shoot him.
MITCHELL	Why?
JONES	Because it's quick.
MITCHELL	So?
JONES	I'll shoot him, then.
MITCHELL	You fucking won't. Any last words?
MITCHELL	I'm going to enjoy this.
MITCHELL	You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
JONES	How did he...
JONES	There!
JONES	Oh no. We're fucked, we're fucked.
MITCHELL	No problem. He's outside. No gun. No vehicle. He's a dead man.
SELENA	You can't do this to her! She's only fourteen!
SELENA	You need to give me a moment with Hannah. Alone.
CLIFTON	The OC. He... he wants you to...
SELENA	He wants us to dress up nice.
SELENA	But if you want us to change, you'll have to get out of the room.
SELENA	(calm, powerful) It's just fucking polite.
CLIFTON	(to the others) Okay. Clear out.
SELENA	Eat them.
SELENA	Eat them, Hannah!
HANNAH	Are you killing me?
SELENA	No. I'm making you not care.
CLIFTON	Hey! What the fuck are you doing?
SELENA	Jim.
BEDFORD	He's at the blockade!
JONES	He went over the wall! We thought he'd be dead sir!
HENRY	Shut up! Davis - you're coming with me!
HENRY	Okay. Let's see if we can sidestep the cat-and-mouse bullshit.
DAVIS	Fuck.
HENRY	Jim?
HENRY	Davis?
HENRY	Fine! Fine, you little bastard! Fucking die out here!
HENRY	Jim.
JONES	What was that? Was that a claymore?
MITCHELL	It was lightning.
JONES	But I heard something.
MITCHELL	I'll go and hit the floods. Take a butcher's. Girls, keep an eye on him, would you?
HANNAH	Those pills. I think they're having an effect. I can feel them, and... I don't feel sleepy, but...
HANNAH	They've been a long time.
HANNAH	What are you going to do if they don't come back?
HANNAH	Will you be the boss if Henry is dead? Is that the way if works?
JONES	Shut up.
HANNAH	I don't think they are coming back. I think they've been killed.
JONES	I told you to shut up!
SELENA	Hannah...
HANNAH	They're dead.
HANNAH	You're going to be next.
JONES	Shit!
CLIFTON	Help! Shoot him! Shoot him!
SELENA	Hannah! Hannah! We have to get out of here!
SELENA	Oh Jesus, Jesus, Hannah, stay with it, stay with it.
HANNAH	(relaxed, as she's yanked
ALONG)	Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.
MITCHELL	What the fuck's going on? What's all the shouti...
MITCHELL	Don't just fucking stand there! Get after them!
BEDFORD	What the fuck are you going to do now, eh?
MITCHELL	Up! Up!
BELL	Mitchell? What's going on?
MITCHELL	Stay here and defend these stairs with your fucking life!
SELENA	Hannah!
JIM	Hannah! Selena!
BELL	I don't have any bullets! I don't have any fucking bullets!
BELL	Don't leave me!
SELENA	Hannah!
MITCHELL	Shut your fucking mouth! You want to get us killed?
MITCHELL	...Shit.
MITCHELL	In here! IN HERE!
MITCHELL	It's me and you, now. And I'm going to get you out of here, and then we're going to find some nice little fucking place, with a pretty little fucking garden, and...
JIM	That was longer than a heartbeat.
SELENA	...Jim?
SELENA	I thought...I thought you were...
JIM	Listen to me. I've got to tell you - I've got to tell you. The world isn't fucked. It's going to be okay. We've got a chance, if we can get to...
JIM	Ow!
SELENA	Hannah! Stop! It's okay!
SELENA	He's not infected!
HANNAH	I thought he was biting you.
JIM	(holding the back of his
HEAD)	I was kissing her! Are you stoned?
SELENA	It's a long story.
SELENA	We have to get out of here.
HENRY	You killed all my boys.
SELENA	Jim!
HENRY	What...Hannah! Hannah?
SELENA	We're going to crash!
SELENA	We're going to crash!
JIM	Just fucking do it!
28 DAYS LATER
HELL
JIM	Jesus. Not the curtains too.
JIM	You looked all right in this, you know.
HELL
HELLO
HANNAH	There! THERE!
JIM	Do you think he saw us this time?
