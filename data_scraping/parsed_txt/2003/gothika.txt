Gothika

MIRANDA	This is your stepfather who came to visit you?
CHLOE	My stepfather?  No.   He's dead. I killed him.
MIRANDA	That's the first time you admit it.
MIRANDA	It means you're finally past the denial stage. This is good, Chloe.
CHLOE	I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
MIRANDA	You only killed your stepfather as far as I know.
CHLOE	I should've taken care of my mother. She knew all along.    You remind me of her.
MIRANDA	I remind you of your mother?
CHLOE	Always so put together. Like you iron your underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the --
MIRANDA	Let's get back to your visitor last night.
CHLOE	The Devil.
MIRANDA	Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?
CHLOE	He came to fuck an angel. I'm his dirty angel.
CHLOE	He grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him and usually I love that, I just do -- maybe you can tell me why I love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough --
MIRANDA	That's it until Monday. Try and get some sleep tonight, okay?
CHLOE	Sure, Doctor. Crazy people hear messages from God. Not the Devil. You know that, right?
MIRANDA	I didn't say you were crazy.
CHLOE	You don't have to say it.
PETE	Dr. Grey.
MIRANDA	Dr. Graham.
PETE	Power went out again in our wing.
MIRANDA	Same here.
PETE	It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know?
MIRANDA	You're not shrink appropriate and you're about to get promoted. Everybody's afraid of something.
PETE	What am I afraid of?
MIRANDA	Yourself. At least you should be. What are you up to this weekend?
PETE	Write a little country music, decline invites to grand social events, drink myself to sleep -- the usual. You?
MIRANDA	Doug wants to look at some Real Estate up at Willow's Creek.
PETE	Again?
MIRANDA	He thinks it's fun.
PETE	So is golfing, I'm told.   Who was your six o'clock?
MIRANDA	Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup. She's a mess.
PETE	I hear Manhattan's full of them.
MIRANDA	Don't start with that. I already turned down the job. We're staying.
PETE	Good girl.
PARSONS	Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and Doug. Are you free tonight?
MIRANDA	He's stuck at a school board meeting.
PARSONS	You've been here a year already, Dorothy's starting to take this personal. How's next Wednesday?
MIRANDA	Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
MIRANDA	Anybody hurt, Sheriff?
SHERIFF RYAN	Nah, telephone post just decided to fall. It'll take us a while to clear this up so I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the long way home, Miranda.
MIRANDA	If you say so.
SHERIFF RYAN	And tell your husband he owes me a phone call.
MIRANDA	Will do. Wouldn't want him in trouble with the authorities.
SHERIFF RYAN	That a girl. The law never sleeps and all that. You take care now.
MIRANDA	Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick up, pick up. I'm on my way but I just got detoured so I'm...
MIRANDA	Stay on the line. Don't go anywhere. The weirdest thing just -- Hello? Hello?
MIRANDA	Wonderful.
MIRANDA	Hello?   Are you hurt?   Hello?
MIRANDA	Were you in an accident? Were you attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor. My name is Miranda Grey...
MIRANDA	You're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural. I'm going to get you to the hospital. Okay?
MIRANDA	Don't be scared. It's going to be fine.
MIRANDA	Hands off me, okay? Tell me your name, do you remember your name?
MIRANDA	What are you doing? I'm trying to help you --?!
MIRANDA	Hello?   Somebody help me!
MIRANDA	What are you doing?
PETE	Giving you something to calm down.
MIRANDA	I don't need to calm down.   What I need is an explanation
PETE	Just take this and we can sit down and chat.
MIRANDA	Why here, why not in my office?
MIRANDA	I don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me Valium.
PETE	Fifty milligrams.
MIRANDA	Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock me out? Ten milligrams.
PETE	Twenty.
MIRANDA	How would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?
PETE	We can discuss it at length after you take your meds.
MIRANDA	Okay.    This better be good.
PETE	Miranda, this is very awkward. Technically I shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. So whatever is said here won't leave this room. I won't tell Parsons, I won't tell anyone.
MIRANDA	I want to talk to my husband.
PETE	You can't to that. Sit down, please. Try to relax.
MIRANDA	Why would I pretend to be in any way relaxed?
PETE	I understand you're upset. But we need to put some things in order.
MIRANDA	Two massive understatements.
PETE	How long have you been here?
MIRANDA	What is this? Why are you doing this to me?
PETE	Just answer the question.    Humor me.
MIRANDA	Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a psychiatrist. I transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a little over a year ago. My job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --
PETE	I don't mean how long you've worked here, I mean how long you've been staying here.
MIRANDA	I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical school just an elaborate dream?
PETE	Of course you're a doctor. A great doctor in fact.
MIRANDA	Pete, how long have I been here?
MIRANDA	What?
PETE	You were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently. That lasted three days. Scans revealed left-sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits.
PETE	You came out of it and tested negative for PCP, underwent extensive hypnosis and received amytal injections.
PETE	You were tied down for a day and a half so you wouldn't hurt yourself and then you went into a state of, well -- You've been pretty much catatonic. This is the first time you speak.
MIRANDA	Doug must be worried sick.   I need to call him --
PETE	You're the most logical person I know, bar none. Plus you have a photographic memory -- unconfirmed, but you do remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around. Why am I telling you this?
MIRANDA	You're establishing my personality as fairly intellectual, you don't consider me impulsive or emotional.
PETE	And that's a fair assessment, no?
MIRANDA	Yes, that's fair. And following this pattern of analysis, we're about to discuss a traumatic event that rendered this psychological profile useless, correct?
PETE	Two hundred percent.
MIRANDA	You think I'm in denial. That I'm putting on a brave show -- that this is a 'cover' for some unbearable emotion I'm hiding. Why?
PETE	Don't analyze yourself, just focus on remembering.
MIRANDA	I remember Friday night after work, if you say that was five days ago -- Anyway, I asked you what you were doing for the weekend and you said the usual and you made a joke about writing country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and I told you I was going to look at some real estate in Willows Creek with Doug.
PETE	And then what?
MIRANDA	Then I drove home.
PETE	And then what?
MIRANDA	I got home, I guess, and had dinner by myself because -- Because Doug had an alumni meeting at his school and he was going to get a ride back. He's the principal now, as you well know.
MIRANDA	But wait -- there was an accident before that, wasn't there? A girl -- she had been beaten. I took her to the hospital, right?
PETE	There was indeed an accident, you were detoured by the cops. But there's no report of any girl.
MIRANDA	No, the cops weren't there. They were back on Main Road. A knocked-down telephone post, correct?
MIRANDA	I saw the girl after that.   She was bleeding.
PETE	What about your husband, what can you tell me about him?
PETE	Wasn't there?
MIRANDA	No. There was no trouble in my marriage, I don't know what -- There is no trouble in my marriage. You just used the past tense; why?
MIRANDA	Did something happen to Doug?
PETE	You don't remember anything else. Anything at all?
MIRANDA	This is preposterous.    What's wrong with Doug?
PETE	He's dead.
MIRANDA	No, he's not. Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that. Are you -- sure?
PETE	I'm positive. You killed him.
PETE	Don't be too hard on yourself, Dr. Grey. You haven't done anything wrong.
MIRANDA	Not yet.   But I want to.
MIRANDA	Can I get some assistance here? Hello?!
MIRANDA	Irene?!   Anybody!?
MIRANDA	Wake up, wake up... You're dreaming. It's not real. An anxiety dream, that's all. That's all. This is dream logic. If it was real, they would have heard you scream. There are twenty employees on the night shift. Fact. At least twenty.
MIRANDA	I'm just dreaming.
MIRANDA	I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming.
MIRANDA	I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
IRENE	Rise and shine, ladies!
IRENE	That means you, honey.   Up -- !
IRENE	Rise and shine now.    Wake up.
IRENE	Easy now, it's okay.
MIRANDA	I need to see Peter Graham.
IRENE	And you have a session scheduled this afternoon --
MIRANDA	Right now.
IRENE	He's not even in yet, now let go my arm, honey.
MIRANDA	Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.
IRENE	Actually I do mind. I start calling you 'doctor' and everybody else wants to be called 'doctor' --
MIRANDA	Please. It's a bit different, wouldn't you say -- ?
MIRANDA	What do you think you're doing?    I want to speak to my lawyer -- wait, what are you doing?
IRENE	My job.
MIRANDA	C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !
CHLOE
JENNA	Mallorol, Matzine, Megaphen, Meallaril-S, Meleretten, Meleril, Mellaril, Mellaril-S, Mesoridazine, Methotrimaprazine, Mixidol, Moban Modalina --
CHLOE	Modalina?   Isn't that a band?
JENNA	Trade name for Triflupoerazine. Look it up.
JENNA	Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress, Motival. That's it for the 'M's.
CHLOE	Not bad. High potency neuroleptics starting with 'J.'
JENNA	Trick question. There's only Jatroneural.
CHLOE	What do you wanna bet?
JENNA	Bet you a soda.
CHLOE	Right on the money, cowgirl. Twenty points and a soda.
SHELLEY	Hi there, Doc.
SHELLEY	I never got shrinked by you but all I hear is nothing gets past you, I mean, that's just hearsay and I don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but I say maybe it just slipped, right?
SHELLEY	They put your picture in the paper.
MIRANDA	How did you get this?
SHELLEY	Chloe did. Who knows how? Not me. Around here I'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff I don't need to know. My point is about people talking behind other people's backs. Like before I was here, everything I did I thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back. But now I'm more anonymous, more myself. I'm Shelley.
SHELLEY	You're not like, undercover here, are you? They pulled that at Spring Grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients, see if they could handle it. Most quit after day one. You're not, are you?
MIRANDA	No, Shelley.   I'm not undercover.
SHELLEY	Because if you were, I'm like the Fort Knox of secrets. Ask anybody.
MIRANDA	That's good to know. But I'm not.
SHELLEY	Say no more. I understand perfectly.
SHELLEY	Drawing is a great cover.   Good luck to you.
MIRANDA	I don't -- I think I'm alright.
IRENE	You go in last because you're special. It's not a Mexican prison, toots. Everybody here minds their own business.
MIRANDA	If it's all the same, I'd rather --
IRENE	State law says we keep you ladies clean. And I'm a stickler for the law. Now come on. If you go downtown, you gotta dance.
IRENE	That's five minutes, group one. Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
MIRANDA	It isn't real. It isn't real.
MIRANDA	It isn't real. You're hallucinating.
MIRANDA	Shelley?
SHELLEY	And pick up those damn cigarette butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --
MIRANDA	Shelley, can you do me a favor??
SHELLEY	The housewives will find something better to do.
MIRANDA	Can you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall?
IRENE	Enough privacy for you?
MIRANDA	Yes.   Thank you, Irene.
IRENE	What did you do?
MIRANDA	Nothing.   It's nothing --
IRENE	What the hell did you do to yourself?!
IRENE	I looked away for a second. It's unacceptable, won't happen again.
PARSONS	Not your fault. Patients always find a way to hurt themselves if that's what they want.
IRENE	I just didn't peg her for a cutter, that's all.
SHELLEY	Oh my God.   Oh my God.
MIRANDA	You saw it?
SHELLEY	Listen, Doctor. Some people, they have a gift. And in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that. It's like that Hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago? It's like that. Doesn't mean you're crazy. It only means your eyes open in a different way.
MIRANDA	What did it say?
SHELLEY	On the telescope?
MIRANDA	Did you see anything, Shelley?
SHELLEY	That's not tile that wall is made out of . It's a holographic screen. All part of your mission, isn't it?
MIRANDA	Thanks anyway.
SHELLEY	This is all we have. The rest is dust.
MIRANDA	It was you I called that night.
PETE	Yes.
MIRANDA	Did you mention that to the cops?
PETE	No.
MIRANDA	Why?
PETE	I didn't think it would help you.
MIRANDA	What does that mean?
PETE	It means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought I had any kind of involvement in what happened.
MIRANDA	And did you?
PETE	Did I what?
MIRANDA	Did I make it to your place?   Did I see you that night?
PETE	No. We got disconnected and I couldn't get through to you. I sat there waiting all night. Figured you'd changed your mind.
MIRANDA	Why didn't you tell me this before?
PETE	Because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. My job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself.
MIRANDA	You're changing the subject.
PETE	The subject is you don't trust me.
MIRANDA	Right now I don't trust anyone.
PETE	You want to talk about today?
MIRANDA	I want to talk to my lawyer.
PETE	I think that's premature.
MIRANDA	I can't help what you think.
JENNA	You a Marlboro girl?
MIRANDA	I don't smoke, thanks.
JENNA	All we have is our health, cupcake. What I do is quit constantly, start again. Drives them all crazy. One day I quit three times.
JENNA	They allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching. Check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock.
MIRANDA	What did you set on fire to wind up here?
JENNA	Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt down the building where I worked. I found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops -- of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. It's beside the point, really.
PARSONS	Hello, Miranda.
MIRANDA	I wonder if I could talk to you.
PARSONS	Of course. Well, actually, I'm about to...
MIRANDA	Your staff meeting's done and Thursdays you don't schedule sessions until the afternoon. This will just take one minute. Promise.
MIRANDA	It's about Pete.
PARSONS	What about him?
MIRANDA	Perhaps he's not the most qualified person to be treating me.
PARSONS	Are you complaining about his methods or are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him?
MIRANDA	What did he tell you?
PARSONS	He explained there might be a conflict of interest because he has feelings for you. You two engaged in a kiss at one point. Am I right?
MIRANDA	Yes.
PARSONS	I told him we're all grownups here and the fact is he's the best doctor on my staff. As such, and given the severity of the charges you face, I consider him the most qualified person to assist your recovery. Now, if you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is not a patient man.
IRENE	Hey!   Chloe!
CHLOE	You fucking cow giving me the evil eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin' voodoo witch -- !
CONSUELO	Is okay, she's okay -- she don't mean nothing.
CHLOE	You bet your goddamn fat ass I mean it, you're a witch -- !!
IRENE	McGrath, that's enough!
CHLOE	Take your voodoo shit back to Cuba --
IRENE	I said that's enough.
CONSUELO	Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la infeliz. It's a misunderstanding. Pobrecita. I was only trying to help her --
CHLOE	You wanna help me? You pity me? Suck me.
IRENE	How are we feeling today?
MIRANDA	'We'?
IRENE	Sorry I asked.
MIRANDA	Doesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics.
IRENE	Fitting right in, aren't you?
TEDDY HOWARD	Miranda.
MIRANDA	Hi.
IRENE	She's due back in the rec room in twenty, Counselor.
TEDDY HOWARD	Thank you kindly.
MIRANDA	Teddy, I know you knew Doug well and this is an extremely --
TEDDY HOWARD	I'm here as your lawyer. So whatever my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence. First things first, how are they treating you?
MIRANDA	Like I'm crazy.
TEDDY HOWARD	You know this place better than anyone. Anything out of the ordinary?
MIRANDA	Other than me being crazy?   No.
TEDDY HOWARD	The DA is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week. They're eager to resolve this situation because -- well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here. Doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model. Our best shot -- scratch that, our only shot -- is to claim temporary insanity.
MIRANDA	Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you know me. I wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. Not even in self-defense. Isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked Doug and I went into shock?
MIRANDA	You're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind?
TEDDY HOWARD	Frankly, no. Neighbors heard screams. They have you at the scene, they have the murder weapon and they have your prints everywhere. The only thing they don't have is motive.
MIRANDA	Because there is no motive.
TEDDY HOWARD	And that's what's confusing them. The fact that you're a brilliant psychiatrist doesn't help either. It fills their heads with ideas. They figure if you were to plan a murder you might know how to fake insanity to get out of it.
MIRANDA	I'm not faking anything.
MIRANDA	The point is I'm the only person who doesn't believe I killed my husband. I never thought I'd say this, but I feel like I'm in the middle of a conspiracy. Do you believe I'm crazy?
TEDDY HOWARD	It doesn't matter what I believe.
MIRANDA	Forget it.   Forget I asked.
PETE	I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
PETE	I can stand here all day. All week. You're the one running out of time.
PETE	What does it mean?
MIRANDA	I didn't write this.
PETE	Then who?
PETE	You're going to have to trust me.
MIRANDA	Why?
PETE	Because no matter what's going through your mind right now, I haven't done anything wrong.
MIRANDA	Then you know exactly how I feel.
PETE	You admit you're having a hard time differentiating what's reality from what's hallucination, right? So isn't it at least possible that --
MIRANDA	As a doctor I agree with you. Maybe -- and this is a big maybe -- all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends to the limbic structures, but I'm telling you --
PETE	How about this moment right now?
MIRANDA	What about it?
PETE	Is this a hallucination?
MIRANDA	You tell me. But I do know what I sound like. Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right?
PETE	Which is why I suggest we simply increase your dose until --
MIRANDA	No!   Goddamnit! No!
MIRANDA	I'm sorry. Is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen?
MIRANDA	I want to believe you. I do. So I'll take your word for it -- you're not involved in this -- but you take mine: I didn't write this and I didn't kill my husband.
PETE	Alright. Let's say you didn't write this --
MIRANDA	Number one: I'm right-handed. Number two: I would have had to bring an X-Acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't I?
PETE	I think it's time you look at these.
PETE	You wrote that. Any idea why?
MIRANDA	No, I didn't. No, I didn't!
PETE	You're the only person who can figure out what this means. Try to remember. Stop holding back.
MIRANDA	Oh God, oh God, oh God...
PARSONS	Dorothy, I can't discuss this now -- I'm not taking it lightly, no.   We will talk about it at home.
PARSONS	Yes, dear. Me too.
PARSONS	I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
PARSONS	Has Pete told you about the hearing?
PETE	Teddy already filled her in.
PARSONS	Teddy Howard is top notch. He's going to do everything in his power -- and he's quite resourceful -- to prove you're not fit to stand trial. Miranda, I know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we --
MIRANDA	Who is that?
PARSONS	Excuse me?
MIRANDA	The girl in the picture.
PARSONS	My daughter.
MIRANDA	She's the girl I saw.
PARSONS	You're obviously mistaken.
MIRANDA	I'm positive. She was hurt, bleeding. Is she all right?
PETE	Miranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office. You're just confused --
MIRANDA	Not about this. Is she all right?
PARSONS	No, she's not... all right. Rachel committed suicide six years ago.
MIRANDA	How?
PETE	Miranda, that's none of your --
PARSONS	That's okay. Rachel was a very troubled girl. Handicapped since birth. She was born mute. My wife and I tried everything to help her fit in but... but she ran away from home more than once, wanting to end her life. And she finally succeeded. Jumped off Ashley Bridge. She was only seventeen years old.
MIRANDA	I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil.
PARSONS	Peter, can I speak to you?
PETE	... Textbook psychotic pattern... manifestation of guilt...
PARSONS	... much she knows about Rachel?
PETE	I'm telling you she doesn't... Concocted alternate reality...
PARSONS	I'm trusting you... crawling with cops.
MIRANDA	Besides, if you really were the ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would let me out of this cell.
MIRANDA	Holy shit.

MIRANDA	Alright. What happened to you?

PETE	Could there be any truth to her claim?
PARSONS	Peter, we have one hundred and forty employees. Thirty-five work maintenance. They all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform. I'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure -- but I don't want a news van parked outside day and night. It makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it?
PETE	I perused Miranda's files on Chloe McGrath -- they're damn comprehensive. Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her.
PARSONS	The scariest gift God gave us is our minds. And a bright person like Miranda -- she's grasping at straws here -- who knows what her brain is telling her, now that it's snapped.
MIRANDA	Did you live here when Rachel killed herself?
PETE	Yes. As a matter of fact, I was part of the search party that found the body.
MIRANDA	Phil must have been a wreck.
PETE	You can imagine. Actually, Phil was in Houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened.
MIRANDA	And this is confirmed. There are hospital records and so forth?
PETE	I'm sure there are.   Can we get back on track now?
MIRANDA	What about these other dates, was Phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead?
PETE	Where are you going with this? First I'm a suspect in Doug's death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own daughter?
MIRANDA	Rachel Parsons disappeared six years ago. A week later she's a suicide. Andrew White, four years ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon, two years ago. Don't you find that unusual?
PETE	What same M.O.? One jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car. Who gave you this?
MIRANDA	Not one left a suicide note. In fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides?
PETE	You heard Phil, his daughter had tried several times before --
MIRANDA	That's his story. I need to talk to the reporter who wrote that. Frank something.
PETE	Well, you can't.
MIRANDA	I beg to differ. I know my visitation rights.
PETE	You can't because... he died.
MIRANDA	You're telling me the one local investigative reporter who connected three highly-suspicious deaths, just happens to have conveniently died?
PETE	Frank Albright was an eighty-year- old retired sociology professor. This is a fluff piece about teenage depression and the breakdown of the nuclear family. You can find one in any local paper, anywhere, any other week!
MIRANDA	Don't be smug, Pete. That's one thing you've never been. Rachel is somehow connected to what I'm going through. I don't know how -- like you said, I'm not in a frame of mind to process the information without assistance. So I'm asking you for assistance.
PETE	Listen to me. You are not well. I had hoped once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it but these fixations:
PETE	Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath -- are self-created distractions to avoid looking into yourself. And the longer you --
MIRANDA	I know this lecture like the back of my hand!
PETE	Good.   Saves me the trouble.
CLAIRE	Get off me, you dog --
SIMON	Hell, don't go all bubbly with joy or anything.
CLAIRE	You can't be in here and you know it. Nap in your car.
CLAIRE	Now get out before we get busted.
SIMON	You slay me, Claire.    Honest.
CLAIRE	Sure I do, Boy Scout.
CLAIRE	Hold it, Simon!
CLAIRE	What do you think I am, laundry service?
SIMON	Won't happen again, ma'am.
SHELLEY	... She'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras. Is that the strangest shit you've heard?
JENNA	Heard stranger. But she's a case.
SHELLEY	And she always put on a happy face. Man, what an optometrist.
JENNA	You narced her out, didn't you? Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little buzzed yourself.
SHELLEY	All work, that woman.   Work, work, work.
JENNA	What are you talking about?
SHELLEY	She's like an alcoholic.   But with work.
SHELLEY	Not safe to tell you.   Wish I could.
MIRANDA	Forget it, alright? Forget we had this conversation.
CHLOE	You know what happens next?
MIRANDA	I get the distinct feeling you're going to tell me.
CHLOE	The shock wears off and the guilt kicks in. And that guilt is the real motherfucker. You'll be watched 24/seven, because they're afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr. Graham will question every harmless gesture, every innocent comment, ever twitch you make and eventually -- and it's a fucking tedious 'eventually' -- you'll stop hating yourself for what you did. But what replaces that hatred is this unbearable sadness. And you don't lose that as long as you live.
MIRANDA	Leave me alone. Go away.
MIRANDA	I've lost my fucking mind.   Happy now?
SIMON	This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me.
SIMON	I've always wanted to do a doctor.
SIMON	The more you fight me, the harder I get, pussycat -- so pretty please, with sugar on top -- keep still.
MIRANDA	Take that, son of a bitch.
MIRANDA	Rachel?
MIRANDA	I can't. Please, please don't make me go back in there.
MIRANDA	Bear with me, I'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay.
MIRANDA	Not alone. What happened to you happened to other girls. I understand. And I'm sorry. But there is nothing I can do about it now. It has nothing to do with me.
MIRANDA	Shit.
MIRANDA	No.   No.   No...
MIRANDA	It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right?
MIRANDA	Is there anybody here?   Hello?
MIRANDA	Go away!   Fuck off!
MIRANDA	C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
MIRANDA	Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Holy shit. Lady, stay right where you are.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Hands up where I can see them.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Nice and slow, start talking to me. And make it good. Tell me just exactly who that is.
SHERIFF RYAN	Mr. Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution --
TEDDY HOWARD	Hold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence --
SHERIFF RYAN	Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of --
TEDDY HOWARD	You had no right to question my client without my presence --
SHERIFF RYAN	Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom. Your client was read her rights and she still insisted --
TEDDY HOWARD	-- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client --
SHERIFF RYAN	I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply stating the frigging facts.
SHERIFF RYAN	Phil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts!
PARSONS	What happened?
SHERIFF RYAN	An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word.
PETE	Who's the girl?
SHERIFF RYAN	A runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update. Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer.
SHERIFF RYAN	Christ, the woman's got the entire hospital busy --
SHERIFF RYAN	Why are you harassing my deputies?
TEDDY HOWARD	I'm only asking him where he got the coffee -- ?
SHERIFF RYAN	He's not at liberty to answer that. You've had enough goddamn coffee already.
PETE	We need to get Miranda back to the institute. She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell.
SHERIFF RYAN	Phil, how well does your wife know the suspect?
PARSONS	Why do you ask?
SHERIFF RYAN	Because she's at the station right now, demanding to speak with her.
DOROTHY	How are you?
DOROTHY	I needed to see you, but I'm not sure where to begin. I don't know you well, I certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you. Phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and -- in any case, I have always thought of you as a very bright, very perceptive doctor. Even though I don't know you well.
DOROTHY	My point is, my point being -- when Rachel died I had, um, I suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams.
DOROTHY	And eventually, once I came to terms with her death, they went away. Losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can --
DOROTHY	The past few days I have been having the same dream. A nightmare.
MIRANDA	That word.   Nightmare.   Welcome to my life.
DOROTHY	This nightmare involves Rachel but it also involves you. In the nightmare Rachel holds a box in her left hand. A small box. And she repeats a series of numbers. Now, Rachel never spoke, from the time she was born -- she had a condition -- I often asked God why he punished this child in such a way -- she couldn't speak, but she was extremely bright. She wasn't autistic as the doctors claimed --
MIRANDA	Mrs. Parsons, you need a therapist. Normally I would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see --
DOROTHY	Every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers. I wrote them down.
DOROTHY	It's a message. It's a code for something. I don't know what. But she wants you to have it.
MIRANDA	October 22nd, 2001. It's my wedding date.
MIRANDA	That code belongs to a safety deposit box my husband kept in a bank up in Newcastle, that's where his parents live. Dorothy, I need you to drive up there and open it.
PETE	We can take those off now.
SHERIFF RYAN	Don't push it, Doctor. She's cuffed until your people secure her in a cell.
PETE	Are you alright?
MIRANDA	I was wrong. It wasn't Phil Parsons. It was Doug.
PETE	Can we talk about this later? Thanks, Sheriff.
SHERIFF RYAN	Tomorrow morning first thing my deputies are here.
PETE	I know, I know. We'll see you then.
SHERIFF RYAN	And my offer still stands if you need added security.
PETE	Thank you. She won't go anywhere. I guarantee it.
MIRANDA	That's why Rachel picked me.    It was Doug. I'm so stupid.
PETE	Inside, okay?
PETE	What is this?
IRENE	She's a hero. Little Red Riding Hood put the big bad wolf in a coma.
OFFICER #1	They're not gonna start something, are they?
IRENE	You ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, Officer?
ORDERLY #1	We'll be right outside, Doctor.
PETE	I pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back. The best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here. Five. Under my --
MIRANDA	Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts before this. And neither do you.
PETE	But you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. The simplest chemical deficiencies can --
MIRANDA	Chemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing!
PETE	I'm a very open-minded person, but as a doctor --
MIRANDA	No, you're not. You're a close- minded academic, just like me. You told me once that I was the most logical person you knew, remember? Well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. Rachel Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago -- tossed off the Ashley Bridge by my husband. My harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband -- that's how pathetically blind I've been.
MIRANDA	Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were also abducted and murdered -- now this was before I met Doug but I bet you anything that they both went to his school. Then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions -- namely me -- delayed him from reverting to his sickness. That's why I didn't notice anything. I believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. Then along comes Tracy Seaver and he can't resist. Locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property --
MIRANDA	Here's Doug's interest in real estate, Pete.
MIRANDA	Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her -- she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention -- and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem. Made sure I killed Doug because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to her. And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way.
PETE	Is that a threat?
MIRANDA	To whom?
PETE	To me.
MIRANDA	To you? I'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when I tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if I don't do what she wants -- she's going to kill me.
MIRANDA	I need you to at least consider the possibility that I'm not insane. Not as a doctor. As the only person I trust in this world.
DOROTHY	I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm doing this for Rachel.
PARSONS	You're making a complete fool of yourself. Do you realize what you sound like?
DOROTHY	What do I sound like, Phil? Like one of your patients? Well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me. And I've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed.
DOROTHY	I'm losing my mind. Our daughter is gone and I miss her and I'm angry.
CONSUELO	It's gonna be an interesting night.
CONSUELO	How are we doing today?
MIRANDA	Just fine, thank you.
CONSUELO	The spirit is not fine.    She's very unhappy.
MIRANDA	How -- how do you know?
CONSUELO	But she's only a girl. Do you know her name?
MIRANDA	Yes.   Rachel.
CONSUELO	Have you talked to her?
MIRANDA	Yes, I -- you could say that.
CONSUELO	She's very, very angry. And she's not finished with you yet.
MIRANDA	I'm sure that's meant to sound comforting but --
CONSUELO	She wants to show you something.
MIRANDA	That may be so, but I want her to go away.
CONSUELO	Then you need to protect yourself.
MIRANDA	And how exactly would I do that?
CONSUELO	Mira, first I'm gonna bring you some cascarilla, it's a powder, you get it anyplace, it comes from eggs -- you pour it all over you -- Like this --
MIRANDA	Look -- Consuelo, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I honestly don't think this ghost will go away if I pour some egg powder on myself --
CONSUELO	She made you do things.   Bad things, didn't she?
MIRANDA	Yes.
CONSUELO	And you carried this out for her. She used you as a vessel...
MIRANDA	What are you doing? I'm trying to help you -- ?!
PARSONS	This proves that her story is true: my daughter appeared to her in some form and guided her through all this, putting things right.
SHERIFF RYAN	Come on, Phil, you of all people --
PARSONS	I of all people hold logic, reason and facts above everything else. And seek the truth through proof and proof only. And what do you call that?
SHERIFF RYAN	Has it occurred to you that maybe she knew what her husband was doing to those girls?
PARSONS	No.   Frankly, it hasn't.
SHERIFF RYAN	Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt and cooked up this far-fetched tale to tug at everybody's heartstrings. The fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces.
PARSONS	The fact remains my daughter was murdered and Miranda stopped the killer. A killer who was loose under your incompetent nose for over six years. We don't know how many future victims were spared, but we do know she saved that girl in the barn's life. And that's more than you or I can say -- !
SHERIFF RYAN	Calm down. For the record, that girl is on a ventilator. The doctors don't think she'll make it through tonight.

SHERIFF RYAN	Now, you want to stand up in a courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this, that's your prerogative -- but I have to abide by the law. And the law says Miranda Grey faces criminal chargers. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you don't go anywhere tonight and two of my deputies will go guard Ms. Grey until tomorrow morning. Phil?
SHERIFF RYAN	There will be no breakouts, no aiding and abetting, no taking the law into your own hands. It'll take an Act of God for Miranda Grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
PARSONS	I'm sorry. I will never forgive myself for what happened to you. Not as long as I live. I miss you so much.
GUARD #1	Help you?
OFFICER TURLINGTON	We're here on Miranda Grey detail.
GUARD #1	Sixth floor. You can get a couple chairs from the nurses up there. A pretty decent cup of joe too.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Thanks, guys.
GUARD #1	Although why the Sheriff is making you fellas waste your time is beside me. We got her right here. She ain't going no place.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't she?
GUARD #1	Don't they all, Officer, don't they all?
GUARD #1	Shit.   There goes the card game.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night.
IRENE	Knock yourself out. Next floor up. It's only a power outage, ladies -- let's call it an early night.
MIRANDA	Please don't. Why are you doing this? It's over. Over and done!
MIRANDA	Let me out of here! Let me out!
SHERIFF RYAN	Christ Almighty.
OFFICER	Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right here.
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Sorry, we thought you might have made a run for it.
MIRANDA	Page Irene ASAP. This patient needs her meds.
SHELLEY	You're gonna get that Pulitzer after all.
MIRANDA	Shh, shh, just rest.
SHELLEY	I told you I could keep a secret.
IRENE	You have really disappointed me tonight, Jenna --
JENNA	Give me a break. You wouldn't respect me if I hadn't tried --
PETE	Everybody accounted for?
PARSONS	We're doing the final count.   Now they can't find the Sheriff.
PARSONS	Are you alright, Miranda?
MIRANDA	Fine, Phil.   Thanks for asking.
PETE	What's going on, Officer?
OFFICER TURLINGTON	One of your patients is holding the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in the cafeteria.
MIRANDA	Chloe.
PARSONS	I think Doctor Grey should be the one to talk to her.
SHERIFF RYAN	Young lady, I don't know how you think you can get out of here, but --
CHLOE	You're very polite for a piggy. Now take off your uniform.
CHLOE	Do it quick.   I won't make fun of you.
CHLOE	Nobody better fucking move up there or I'll blow this piggy's head off!
CHLOE	That means you, fucko. Up on your feet or I'll start by shooting his ear off.
CHLOE	Tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here. Do it.
SHERIFF RYAN	Turlington, it's alright. I can -- I'm just going to --
CHLOE	The grownups are talking.   Don't paraphrase me.
SHERIFF RYAN	The grownups are -- are talking now. Just leave.
MIRANDA	Chloe?   Can I talk to you?
CHLOE	Dreadful timing, I'm real busy.
MIRANDA	You have to let him go.   I'm sorry.
CHLOE	Look -- let's not confuse things. I like you. But this is my only chance. Now take off that goddamn uniform before I get really pissed.
MIRANDA	What are you going to do? Put on his uniform and walk out of here? Think about it, Chloe. They know you have him. The place is crawling with cops.
CHLOE	What are my options? To grow old in this place? It's clear they will never let me go. Never. Ever.
MIRANDA	That's not true. You have less than a year left here.
CHLOE	That's a lie! I'll never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. No wonder you doctors can't help anyone -- all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing!
MIRANDA	You're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. But I know you, Chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. And you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. It's up to you.
MIRANDA	No more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness. You have no use for any of that anymore. Your life begins this very second.
CHLOE	I'm so tired.    So goddamn tired --
MIRANDA	It was you, wasn't it?
SHERIFF RYAN	What are you talking about?
MIRANDA	'Not alone.' That's what Rachel has been trying to tell me all along. Doug was not alone. You were with him. This whole time it's been you. You covered up their deaths to look like suicides.
SHERIFF RYAN	You've lost your mind.
MIRANDA	Don't fucking move.
PETE	Miranda, don't do it!
SHERIFF RYAN	And just exactly who would believe you? No proof, no living witness. Everybody knows you're crazy.
SHERIFF RYAN	I want that woman in custody. She has a judge to face in the morning.
PETE	I'll call your lawyer and -- !
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Sir, not now --
PETE	I'll meet you at the station!
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Sir, please --
PETE	What?
MIRANDA	The girl in the hospital.
DOCTOR	Her condition remains the same. Basically that ventilator is keeping her alive. We have no reason to think she'll ever wake up. I'm sorry.
PETE	You mind if I stay here tonight?
DOCTOR	Hey, it's a big place. The more the merrier. If I can just ask you to wait outside.
HOSPITAL LOUDSPEAKER	Dr. Brooks to ER. Dr. Brooks --
DOCTOR	That's me.   Excuse me.
NURSE #1	V-tach.
DOCTOR	Clear!
SHERIFF RYAN	How did you know?
MIRANDA	You tell me.
SHERIFF RYAN	This isn't one of your word association games, Doctor. Did Douglas tell you that night?
MIRANDA	Why wait this long if he had?
SHERIFF RYAN	Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe you blocked it out.
MIRANDA	Maybe. But it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure.
SHERIFF RYAN	You think me and Doug are monsters. That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. But it wasn't that at all. You do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. Life goes on.
MIRANDA	If you're looking for forgiveness, you came to the wrong place.
SHERIFF RYAN	One thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things.
MIRANDA	Be that as it may, you're afraid too -- because you know killing me won't solve your problems.
SHERIFF RYAN	My only problem is you.
MIRANDA	What about Parsons? And Peter? They know. And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. You miscalculated, now you pay.
SHERIFF RYAN	I hate a bad bluffer.
MIRANDA	I sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle. Can you?
SHERIFF RYAN	Go ahead, hit me back. It's what you want.
MIRANDA	No, that's what you want me to do.
SHERIFF RYAN	Back to profiling, huh? Your thought process is completely transparent.
MIRANDA	So we're even. You left that door open so I'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it?
SHERIFF RYAN	I guess we'll find out.
MIRANDA	And yet you have to make me look like a suicide. With what, your belt? How would I get access to a belt?
SHERIFF RYAN	Trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything.
MIRANDA	I don't think that's going to satisfy you. You won't be able to do this clean. You have too much guilt inside.
MIRANDA	You're losing grasp of the situation. It was different with those girls. I bet all they did was cry and scream.
SHERIFF RYAN	Don't worry, you'll scream. Take off your shirt.
MIRANDA	Aren't I a little old for you?
SHERIFF RYAN	Take it off.
MIRANDA	That's for show. You know you can't shoot me.
SHERIFF RYAN	But I can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. Now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.
SHERIFF RYAN	Today, Doctor.
MIRANDA
SHERIFF RYAN	Doug mentioned you were painfully 'modest.' But enough about you, let's discuss Rachel.
SHERIFF RYAN	She was no crippled saint. Wasn't the first time she turned up at Doug's house all messed up.
SHERIFF RYAN	It wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it. But I believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything -- certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out. Tell you what, keep the shirt. The bra will do.
SHERIFF RYAN	Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did. You followed it all the way through. This is how it ends.
SHERIFF RYAN	Doug settled down once you two got married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
SHERIFF RYAN	Or so he claimed. Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn't resist. I asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure.
SHERIFF RYAN	You can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life.
SHERIFF RYAN	The only soul you can ever count on is yourself --
SHERIFF RYAN	Why, Doctor.   That was unexpected.
SHERIFF RYAN	You sure about this?
SHERIFF RYAN	You need me alive for your story to stick. Be logical now. You know you can't kill me.
MIRANDA	Logic is overrated.
PETE	Anybody in here -- ?
TRACY SEAVER	Hello -- ?
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Sheriff Ryan?
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Sheriff?
OFFICER TURLINGTON	Jesus H. Christ.
CHLOE	Thank you for everything, Dr. Graham. I'll never forget all you've done for me.
PETE	It's been my pleasure, Miss McGrath. Good luck out there.
CHLOE	Well, I guess this is it. I hope not to see you again unless it's for coffee or something.
PETE	Hey, you never know. It's a small world, unless you have to clean it.
CHLOE	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but -- have you ever heard anything from -- ?
MIRANDA	Well, gotta run now, I have some country songs to write and lots of social invites to decline...
MIRANDA	P.S. And in case you're wondering what the chances are of me buying you a beer and maybe finishing something we almost started, the answer is: it's just not going to happen. Especially not at McSorley's next Friday night. Say around nine. So you probably shouldn't bother showing up. All my love, M.G.
