Sleepless in Seattle

 SAM	Mommy got sick and it happened  just like that and there was  nothing anybody would do.
 SAM	 If we start asking why we'll gocrazy.  So, rule number one. We don't ask why.
 ANNIE	 Why? I just want to know why?That's my first rule.  I alwaysask why.  Come on.  Tell me. C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
 SETH	 There's no why, Annie.  I'mjust not up for it.  I neversaid I was.
 ANNIE	 Is there somebody else?
 SETH	 Nope.
 ANNIE	 You don't love me, is that it?
 SETH	 Nope.
 ANNIE	 How about ... you're toonarcissistic to commit toanother human being in a long-  term way.
 SETH	 That's good.
 SUZY	 Five minutes in the microwave. Any one of them, five minutesand done.  Ready to eat.  Doyou know how to make juice?
 SAM	 Microwave.  Five minutes.
 ANNIE	 You take the microwave?
 SETH	 What am I going to do with amicrowave?
 ANNIE	 You turn it on, you open it andyou stand in front of it for avery long time.
 SETH	 So you're angry.  Big deal.
 ROB	 Young man, it's none of mybusiness, but maybe you shouldtalk to someone.  I myselfhave consulted a professional. I used to be up tight.
 SAM	 Hypnotherapy...Shiatu Massage...  Loss of Spouse support groups...  Single parent discussion nights...  Parents without partners.  Partners without parents. People who need people.  Guyswho go into the woods, beatdrums and bond.  Get a shrink. Hug a friend.  Hug yourself.
 SAM	 Don't mind him.  He's the guywho just lost his wife.  What I really think is we needa change.
 ROB	 Good idea.  Take a few weeksoff, get some sun, take Jonahfishing --
 SAM	 A real change.  New city. Someplace where every time I goaround a corner I don't thinkof Maggie.
 ROB	 Where you going to go?
 SAM	 I was thinking about Seattle.
 LAURIE	 Honey, he wasn't right for you.
 ANNIE	 I know.
 LAURIE	 He wasn't even wrong for you,like cosmically wrong, so don'tbeat up on yourself forwasting...however long it was.
 ANNIE	 I know.
 LAURIE	 Maybe you should see a shrink.
 LAURIE	 Go home for the weekend.
 ANNIE	 That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'mgoing back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high-  five?
 JONAH	 Dad says I'm going to get usedto it, but I don't think youcan ever get used to adesignated hitter.
 SUZY	 Eventually, in a few months,you'll start seeing women,you'll meet someone.
 SAM	 Move on.  Right.  That's whatI'm going to do.  In a fewmonths, boom, I'll be fine,I'll just grow a new heart.
 SUZY	 I'm sorry --
 GREG	 Sam, she didn't mean --
 SAM	 I know, I know.  Look, it doesn't happen twice.
 ANNIE	 I'm going to meet someone,someone nice and stable whowears a hat so he won't catch acold, and I'm going to marryhim and have three childrenand live happily ever after. I mean, I am not cut out for this
 DIANE	 For what?
 ANNIE	 For life as we know it.
 LAURIE	 Just make sure he isn't fatlike my Michael or you'll spendyour whole life worrying he'sgoing to drop dead.
 JUDITH	 God, you guys are so romantic.
 ANNIE	 Do you know how long romancelasts?  That long.
 DIANE	 Steven still brings me flowersevery Friday and we've beenmarried 10 years.
 LAURIE	 Honey, nobody wants to hearthat.  Here, darling, have some TicTacs.
 ANNIE	 The next time you see me I amgoing to be incredibly happy.
 SAM	 I'm your dad.  Don't everforget that.  That's rulenumber two.  It's you and me, kid.
 ANNIE	 I guess it's just us.

 CLIFF	 Are you all right?
 WALTER	 It's nothing.  Nothing.
 ANNIE	 It's probably just the flowers --

 WALTER	 Don't touch them.  I feelterrible sneezing at a timelike this.  This is a bigmoment for me --
 ANNIE	 He's allergic to everything,don't worry about it --

 CLIFF	 Cold salmon.  A lovely cucumbersalad.  Strawberries.
 WALTER	 I'm afraid I'm allergic tostrawberries.
 CLIFF	 No strawberries.
 ANNIE	 Is that all right with you?
 WALTER	 Today I consider myself theluckiest man on the face ofthe earth.
 IRENE	 What are you wearing?
 ANNIE	 I don't know.
 BETSY	 I wish you would wear my dress. I only wore it once, and you'llbarely have to do anything toit except take it in in thebust --
 BARBARA	 I have something that might do
 BARBARA	 The Historical Society wantedthis and I never would give itto them --
 ANNIE	 Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
 BARBARA	 I notice these things are backin fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
 ANNIE	 I know.  He's wonderful, isn'the?
 BARBARA	 Are his folks nice?
 ANNIE	 You'll love them.  We're goingdown to D.C.  tonight to be withthem Christmas morning.
 BARBARA	 How did it happen?
 ANNIE	 It's silly, really.  I mean,I'd seen him at the office,obviously I'd seen him, he'sthe associate publisher, andthen one day we both orderedsandwiches from the same place,and he got my lettuce andtomato sandwich on whole wheat,which of course he was allergicto, and I got his lettuce andtomato on white.
 BARBARA	 How amazing.
 ANNIE	 It is, isn't it? You makemillions of decisions that meannothing and then one day youdecide to order takeout and itchanges your life.
 BARBARA	 Destiny takes a hand.
 ANNIE	 Oh, please.  Destiny's justsomething we've inventedbecause we can't stand the factthat everything that happens isaccidental.
 BARBARA	 Then how do you explain thatyou both ordered exactly thesame sandwich except for thebread? How many people in thisworld like lettuce and tomatowithout something else liketuna?
 ANNIE	 It wasn't a sign.  It was acoincidence.
 BARBARA	 I was in Atlantic City with myfamily.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking outfor a midnight walk on theSteel Pier.  I've probably toldyou this a million times, butI don't care.  And then he heldmy hand.  I was scared.  Allsorts of thing were goingthrough my head.  But after awhile I forgot about them.  Atone point I looked down, at ourhands, and I couldn't tellwhich fingers were mine andwhich were his.  And I knew.
 ANNIE	 What?
 BARBARA	 You know.
 ANNIE	 What?
 BARBARA	 Magic.  It was magic.
 ANNIE	 Magic.
 BARBARA	 I knew we would be togetherforever, and that everythingwould be wonderful, just theway you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formalname, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knewwas that your father and I weregoing to have a wonderful time  ... in the sack I believe youcall it --
 ANNIE	 Mom!
 BARBARA	 Of course it took several yearsbefore everything worked likeclockwork in that department,so don't be worried if it takesa while --
 ANNIE	 Mom, we already...
 BARBARA	 Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle dadee.  And how's it working?
 ANNIE	 Like... clockwork.
 BARBARA	 So you'll get married in a newdress.
 ANNIE	 It's a sign.
 BARBARA	 You don't believe in signs.
 ANNIE	 They loved you.  I told youthey would love you and theydid.
 WALTER	 I love you.
 ANNIE	 I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call youanything other than Walter?
 WALTER	 Nope.
 ANNIE	 Even when you were young?
 WALTER	 Nope.  Not even when I wasyoung.
 WALTER	 You sure you don't want todrive with me?
 ANNIE	 How will I get back toBaltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present foryour stepmother -- I took itinside by accident.
 WALTER	 I'll wait.
 ANNIE	 Don't be silly.  I'll just beten minutes behind you.

 JONAH	 It's not that late in Seattle.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Got me there.  What's yourChristmas wish, Jonah?
 JONAH	 It's not for me.  It's for mydad.  I think he needs a newwife.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 You don't like the one he wasnow?
 JONAH	 He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Where's your mom?
 JONAH	 She died.
 ANNIE	 I don't believe this --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
 JONAH	 I've been pretty sad, but Ithink my dad is worse.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 And you're worried about him.
 JONAH	 I'm worried about him, he'sworried about me, I ride mybike to school, he follows inthe car, like I'm not supposedto know he's there.  Now it'sChristmas, and you know whathappens to people at Christmas.
 ANNIE	 They lose their minds and callcrackpot doctors on the radio --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Have you talked to your dadabout this?
 JONAH	 No.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Why not?
 JONAH	 It's very hard for him to talkabout this stuff.  It's like itmakes him sadder.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 You want me to talk to him?
 ANNIE	 Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
 JONAH	 And you crazy? He thinks showslike this are dumb.  If youdidn't have an 800 number Icould never get away with this
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Is he home right now?
 JONAH	 Yeah.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Well, I think I can help alittle more if I talk to himdirectly.
 JONAH	 I don't know --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 I'm sure he won't be angry oncehe realizes how concerned youare about him.
 JONAH	 Okay, but if I get yelled at,I'm never gonna listen to thisshow again.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Fair enough.
 JONAH	 Dad --
 SAM	 What is it?

 ANNIE	 This is completely disgusting.
 SAM	 Hello.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Hello, Sam, this is Dr. MarciaFieldstone on Network America.

 SAM	 Who is this?
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Dr. Marcia Fieldstone ofNetwork America.
 SAM	 Jesus, are we on the air?Jonah, for God's sake --

 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 He feels that since your wife'sdeath you've been very unhappy.He's genuinely worried about you.
 SAM	 I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'mnot mad at you.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 I think it's hard for him totalk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and itwould make him feel a littlebetter.
 JONAH	 Please --
 ANNIE	 This is a grotesque violationof this man's personal life,but never mind --
 SAM	 All righ...
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Good.  How long ago did yourwife die?

 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 And I don't want to invade yourprivacy --
 ANNIE	 Sure you do.
 SAM	 Sure you do --
 SAM	 Look, we had a tough time atfirst, but I think I'm holdingmy own as a dad, and Jonah andI will get along fine again assoon as I break his radio.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 I have no doubt that you're agood dad.  You can tell a lotfrom a person's voice.  Butsomething must be missing ifJonah feels that you're stillunder a cloud.
 JONAH	 Tell her how you don't sleep atnight.
 SAM	 How do you know that?
 JONAH	 I can hear you walking aroundsometimes.  At first I thoughtit was a robber.  Go ahead,tell her, Dad.
 SAM	 I don't think I have to now.
 SAM	 Look, it's almost Christmas --  A kid needs a mother --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Could it be that you needsomeone just as much as Jonahdoes?
 ANNIE	 Yes.
 ANNIE	 I'm losing my mind.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 We've been talking to -- well,let's just call him Sleeplessin Seattle, and we'll be rightback after this break withlistener response, yourresponse, to the things we'vebeen discussing.  The number tocall is...
 SAM	 What's she talking about?
 JONAH	 This is where other people getto call in and dump on what yousaid.
 LORETTA	 I'll bet he's tall, with a cutebutt.
 HARRIET	 I'll bet he hasn't shaved in aweek.  I'll bet he stinks.
 LORETTA	 Shut up, Harriet.  What'll it be?
 ANNIE	 Coffee, please.  Black.  To go.
 LORETTA	 Maybe I should hustle myselfout to Seattle.  Give him alittle present for New Year'sEve.
 HARRIET	 You can go there if you wantbut don't open his refrigerator. They don't cover anything whenthey put it in the fridge. They just stick it in and leaveit there till it walks out byitself.
 LORETTA	 Harriet, ever since youdivorced your last husband,you've been no fun.  I'mlooking, and this guy pops mytarts.
 TRUCK DRIVER	 Come on, Loretta, you're goingto have to jump-start this guy. His battery's dead.  And lookat me.  Mister Ever-Ready. Every six minutes, anothercharge.
 LORETTA	 I'm looking for someonesensitive.
 ANNIE	 Come on, nobody wants a guywho's sensitive on the radio.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Let's take a call before we getback to Sleepless.  Knoxville,Tennessee, you're on.
 SWEET SOUTHERN VOICE	 Yes, I would just like to knowwhere I could get this man'saddress?
 LORETTA	 Honey, get on line.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Do you think there's somebodyout there you could love asmuch as your wife? Maybe evenmore?
 SAM	 It's hard to imagine.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 What are you going to do, Sam?
 SAM	 I don't know.  When I met mywife, it was so clear.  I justknew.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 What was it that made you know?
 SAM	 I don't think I could reallydescribe it.
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Why not?
 SAM	 And if I could describe it,it probably wouldn't be on a radioshow.  But what the hell.  It's notone specific thing.  It's moreof a feeling.
 SAM	 You touch her for the firsttime, and suddenly... you'rehome.  It's almost like...
 ANNIE	 Magic.

 ANNIE	 People call up these shows andyou can't believe the stuffthey say.  It's the end ofprivacy as we know it, thiscountry is just one big globalvillage with everyone out theregoing blah blah blah --
 SAM	 The hopes are perfect --beautiful, identical, smooth --and they are for somethingreally amazing I feel it in mybones --

 KEITH	 This man sells the greatestsoup you've ever eaten, there'sa line around the block, and heis, I am not kidding, the meanestman in America.  I feel strongly about this,Becky.  This is not just aboutsoup.
 BECKY	 Do it.  What else?
 WYATT	 New Year's Eve.  Please don'tmake me write it.
 BECKY	 Wyatt, I do not mean to remindyou of your mother, but if youdon't put that game away, no TVfor a week.
 WYATT	 Would someone look this up,don't tell me where.
 BECKY	 Listen to this.  Phone servicein the greater Chicago area wastied up for two hours ChristmasEve because some kid called aphone-in show to get a wife forhis father.  Two thousand womencalled in for the number.
 KEITH	 Jesus.
 ANNIE	 I heard it.  This kid calls upand says my dad needs a wifeand I'm talking to myself inthe car saying, this iscompletely disgusting, you'retaking advantage of a child,and then the father gets on andthis shrinkette says, do youwant to talk about it? And hesays no as a matter of fact Idon't, and I am saying, bravo!Right on! Don't talk to her,it's none of her business --  -- and then suddenly, for noreason at all, he's talkingabout how much he loved hiswife, and how he just --  fell in love with her and I amcrying.  Me.  A tear isactually rolling down my face. It was like what happens when Iwatch those phone company ads. I don't have to see the wholead, I just have to see the partwhere the daughter gives hermother a refrigerator with abig red bow on it, have youseen that one?
 BECKY	 You should write somethingabout this.
 ANNIE	 About what?
 BECKY	 Whatever it is.
 KEITH	 What it is is, there are a lotof desperate women out therelooking for love.
 WYATT	 Especially over a certain age.
 KEITH	 It is easier to be killed by aterrorist after the age of 40than it is to get married --
 ANNIE	 That is not true.  Thatstatistic is not true.
 BECKY	 It's not true, but it feelstrue.
 ANNIE	 There's practically a wholebook about how that statisticis not true --
 WYATT	 Calm down.  You brought it up --
 ANNIE	 I did not, Wyatt.
 BECKY	 So where were we?
 WYATT	 New Year's Eve.  I'll do it,okay?
 BECKY	 Okay.
 ANNIE	 If someone is a widower, why dothey say he was widowed? Whydon't they say he was widowered?
 ANNIE	 I was jus wondering.
 BECKY	 What was that about up there?
 ANNIE	 What was what?
 BECKY	 What's with you?
 ANNIE	 Nothing's with me.
 BECKY	 "Sleepless in Seattle"?
 ANNIE	 That's what she called him onthe show.  Because he can'tsleep.
 BECKY	 And now 2,000 women want hisnumber.  The guy could be acrackhead, a psychopath, aflasher, a junkie, atransvestite, a chain-sawmurderer, or someone reallysick, like Rick.
 ANNIE	 Actually, he sounded nice.
 BECKY	 Oh? Oh, really? Now we'regetting down to it.
 ANNIE	 Not.

 JAY	 Punch me, punch in right here.  And she wants the Sub-Zero withthe side-by-side doors --

 BOB	 So we thought --
 JAY	 Since you're on the make again
 SAM	 Great.  This is great.  Thewhole town knows.  Just out ofcuriosity, how do you two know?
 BOB	 Grace heard it.
 SAM	 Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
 BOB	 The point is, take the clientout to dinner and ask her tomarry you and then maybe wewon't have to redo the kitchencabinets.
 SAM	 Why me? What about Jay?
 JAY	 Hey, my plate is full.
 SAM	 Well, okay.  What's the bigdeal?  If she'll forget thenew fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the rightdirection.
 JONAH	 Dad, I don't know about thisone --

 JONAH	 No, I'm not, but --
 SAM	 What's the matter with thisone? Wouldn't you like to haveImelda Marcos as your mother?
 JONAH	 Dad --
 SAM	 We better take the measurementsfor the new cabinets.
 BOB	 Sam, if you're not doinganything New Year's --obviously you're not doinganything New Year's -- we'rehaving some people over, all ofthem married, not one evenremotely interested in playingaround.  Does that sound greator what?  I can't think of the last timeI was at a party when anythingactually happened.
 SAM	 Thanks, but I'll pass.  It'skind of a big night.  I don'tlike to leave Jonah alone.
 SAM	 Does red pepper go under R or
 JONAH
 SAM	 What?
 JONAH	 I forgot to mention.  Jedcalled --

 JONAH	 Jed is having a slumber partyNew Year's Eve and he invitedme.
 SAM	 Fine.  Fine.
 JONAH	 So I can go.

 ANNIE	 I don't think so.
 JONAH	 Look at this, Dad.  They'reall for you --
 MAILMAN	 If you're having troublesleeping, you might want to trydrinking a glass of water fromthe other side.
 JONAH	 I thought that was for hiccups.
 MAILMAN	 Does it work for hiccups?
 JONAH	 For hiccups, a spoonful ofsugar, you hold it in yourmouth for a minute.
 MAILMAN	 Really?
 SAM	 Just out of curiosity, how didthey get our address?
 JONAH	 They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive manI've ever laid ears on."
 SAM	 How did they get our phonenumber?
 JONAH	 You have to give them yourphone number or they won't letyou go on the air.
 JONAH	 "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: Iam an SWF"--  What is that?
 SAM	 Thank God.  Something you don'tknow.  It's a single whitefemale.
 JONAH	 This is no good.  She's lookingfor someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: Ilive in Tulsa." Where is that?
 SAM	 Oklahoma.  Do you know wherethat is?
 JONAH	 Somewhere in the middle.
 SAM	 I'm not going to think aboutwhat they're not teaching youin school.  I am not going tothink about it.  Generally speaking I think weshould rule out people whodon't live somewhere near here
 JONAH	 She's willing to fly anywhere.
 SAM	 She looks like my third gradeteacher.  I hated my thirdgrade teacher.  Hold it! Waita minute! She is my thirdgrade teacher!
 JONAH	 Dad, you're not taking thisseriously.
 SAM	 This is not how you do it.  You want this on an Englishmuffin or a bun?
 JONAH	 English muffin.  How do you doit?
 SAM	 You see someone you like, youget a feeling about them, youask them if they want to have adrink or --
 JONAH	 -- a slice of pizza --
 SAM	 But not dinner necessarily onthe first date because by thetime you're halfway throughdinner you might be sorry youasked them to dinner whereas ifit's just a drink, if you likethem you can always ask themfor dinner but if you don't youcan go home if you see what Imean.  I wonder if it still works thisway.
 JONAH	 It doesn't.  They ask you.
 SAM	 I'm starting to notice that.
 JONAH	 If you get a new wife, I guessyou'll have sex with her, huh?
 SAM	 What do you think?
 JONAH	 Will she scratch up your back?
 SAM	 What?
 JONAH	 In the movies women are alwaysscratching up guy's back andscreaming and stuff.  Whenthey're having sex.
 SAM	 Whose show was this on?
 JONAH	 Jed's got cables.
 SAM	 Go to sleep.
 JONAH	 Kiss Howard.  G'night, Howard.

 ANNIE	 I mean, why did you getmarried? Was it all fireworksand trumpets and --
 TOM	 I got married because Betsysaid we had to break up or getmarried.  So we get married.
 ANNIE	 But when you met her, did youbelieve she was the only personfor you? That in some mystical,cosmic way, it was fated?
 TOM	 Annie, when you meet someoneand you're attracted to them,it just means that yoursubconscious is attracted totheir subconscious,subconsciously.  So what wethink of as chemistry is justtwo neuroses knowing that theyare a perfect match.
 ANNIE	 I don't even know him.  ButI'm having all these fantasiesabout a man I've never met,who lives in Seattle.
 TOM	 It rains nine months of theyear in Seattle.
 ANNIE	 I know, I know.  I do not wantto move to Seattle.  But what Ireally don't want to do is endup always wondering what mighthave happened and knowing Icould have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it?Everyone panics before they getmarried, didn't you?
 TOM	 Yes, I did.
 ANNIE	 Thank you, Tom.  I feel so muchbetter just having blown thisoff.
 TOM	 Any time.

 ANNIE	 Now those were the days whenpeople knew how to be in love.
 BECKY	 You're a basket case.
 ANNIE	 They knew it.  Time, distance,nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It wasright.  It was real.  It was...
 BECKY	 ... movie.  That's your problem.  You don'twant to be in love.  You wantto be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
 ANNIE	 "Dear Sleepless and Son..."
 BECKY	 It sounds like the name of amattress store --
 ANNIE	 "I am not the sort of personwho listens to call-in radioshows" --
 BECKY	 And this woman is a writer!That's what everyone writes atthe beginning of letters tostrangers.
 ANNIE	 I know that.  You think I don'tknow that? "I know that's adumb way to begin, but it's theonly way I can think of toconvey what happened to me theother night when I heard thetwo of you on the radio.  Onthe other hand, maybe I'm justlosing my mind."
 BECKY	 You are.  You're losing yourmind.  What about Walter?
 ANNIE	 I'm going to marry Walter.  Ijust have to get this out of mysystem.
 BECKY	 Right.
 ANNIE	 I should say something in thisabout magic.
 BECKY	 What?
 ANNIE	 I don't know.  I mean, what ifI never meet him? What if thisman is my destiny and I nevermeet him?
 BECKY	 Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
 ANNIE	 "I want to meet you..."
 BECKY	 "On top of the Empire StateBuilding at sunset onValentine's Day."
 ANNIE	 Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in NewYork with Walter, I can squeezeit in.
 BECKY	 You want to hear about destiny?If my husband hadn't gone on adiet, which caused me to leavehim, I would never have been onthat flight to Miami, and metRick, and ended up having sexin the bathroom of a 727 withthat nob you slide that says"vacant-occupied, vacant-  occupied, vacant-occupied" --
 ANNIE	 You never told me you left yourhusband because he went on adiet.
 BECKY	 He lost all the weight...there.
 ANNIE	 That's impossible.  A guy can't
 BECKY	 Can too.
 ANNIE	 No.
 BECKY	 Yes.
 ANNIE	 And then you left him? He lostweight there and you left him?
 BECKY	 Plus he fell in love with atemp.
 ANNIE	 Listen to this, I love thispart --
 BECKY	 Men never get this movie.
 ANNIE	 I know.
 BECKY	 Do you think at the end of themovie when she's in thewheelchair they can still doit?
 ANNIE	 I always wondered about thattoo.
 SAM	 It's okay, it's okay.  I'mhere.
 JONAH	 It was sinking.
 SAM	 What was?
 JONAH	 Our house.  There was watercoming in all the windows.
 SAM	 You're worried we're going tobe all right.  We're going tobe all right.  I remember sometimes you'd havenightmares as a baby.  Your momwould hold you and rock you andsing you a song.
 JONAH	 Bye bye blackbird.
 SAM	 Is that what she used to sing?
 JONAH	 I miss her.  What do you think happens tosomeone after they die?
 SAM	 I don't know.
 JONAH	 Like do you believe in heaven?
 SAM	 I never did.  Or the whole ideaof an afterlife.  But I don'tknow any more.  I have thesedreams about... your mom... andwe have long talks about...about you, and how you are,which she sort of knows but Itell her anyway.  So what isthat? It's sort of an afterlife,isn't it?
 JONAH	 I'm starting to forget her.
 SAM	 I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And aslong as I have you, I have yourMom.
 SAM	 I... uh... have a date withsomeone Friday night.
 JONAH	 Good.
 SAM	 Did I ever tell you about thetime I ate a dog biscuit?
 ANNIE	 Laurie, it's Annie.  Fine, I'mfine.  Listen, I'm doing anarticle on call-in radio shows. Do you know anyone who worksfor someone named Dr. MarciaFieldstone...?

 SAM	 I left the number of therestaurant I'll be at ifthere's any emergency.
 CLARISE	 Fine.
 SAM	 How do I look?
 JONAH	 Great.
 SAM	 I look stupid.  I look stupid,don't I? I look like I'mtrying too hard.  I was goingto get a haircut but then Ithought I'd look like I justgot a haircut.
 JONAH	 This is a good letter, Dad.
 SAM	 The heels on these shoes arevery large.  Why have I nevernoticed this? The heels onthese shoes are grotesque.
 JONAH	 Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
 SAM	 Now I'm late.  Bye.
 JONAH	 Listen to this --
 SAM	 Not now, Jonah --
 JONAH	 Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellentthird-baseman for as long as Ior anyone else can remember,and I guarantee you will notget one past me"
 SAM	 Jonah, I'm leaving --
 JONAH
 JONAH	 Dad!
 SAM	 Everyone thinks Brooks Robinsonis the greatest.
 JONAH	 It's a sign.
 SAM	 Oh, right.
 SAM	 Come here.  I want to show yousomething.
 SAM	 Here is Seattle.  And here is Baltimore.  Caseclosed.
 JONAH	 She doesn't want us to go toBaltimore.  She wants to meetus in New York City onValentine's Day.  On top of theEmpire State Building.
 SAM	 Perfect.  We'll be there.
 SAM	 Hi.
 VICTORIA	 Hi.
 SAM	 You look good.
 VICTORIA	 You look good yourself.
 VICTORIA	 I thought you were never goingto call me.
 SAM	 You did?
 VICTORIA	 I really wanted you to call me,and I thought you were nevergoing to --
 SAM	 You could have called me --
 VICTORIA	 No way.  No way I was going tobe the first woman you went outwith after...  There is no percentagewhatsoever in being the firstwoman anyone goes out withafter...
 SAM	 You are the first woman I'mgoing out with.
 VICTORIA	 Oh.
 SAM	 So whatdya say? I'll get thecheck, and I'll call you ineight months.
 VICTORIA	 Oh, you are funny --
 ANNIE	 Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has isbeing repossessed, includinghis filthy, dented mobile home.
 WHEEDLE	 He's got a houseboat.
 ANNIE	 I hate boats.
 WHEEDLE	 It sounds nice.
 ANNIE	 Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hatethem.
 WHEEDLE	 Houseboats don't go anywhere.
 ANNIE	 Boats.  All anyone talks aboutis the wind.  Is it up, is itdown.  I can't live with a manwho only talks about the wind.
 WHEEDLE	 It's not a boat boat.  It'sreally a house.
 ANNIE	 But it's on the water.
 WHEEDLE	 It's on the lake right in themiddle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of theyear in Seattle.
 ANNIE	 I hope I don't have to pay forthat piece of information.
 WHEEDLE	 No, that's free.  He's anarchitect.  Used to do bighigh-profile projects.  Hescaled it all back when hiswife died.  Now he remodelspeople's homes.  He works ina small firm, makes a goodliving.
 ANNIE	 He's real.
 JONAH	 I figure we could go to NewYork, catch the Knicks, andsince we'd be there anyway,obviously we'd go to the EmpireState Building --
 SAM	 There she is.
 JONAH	 Why is she bringing that bag?
 SAM	 She's going to cook somethingfor us?
 VICTORIA	 Hi, Sam.  And let me guess --you must be Jonah.
 JONAH	 Hi.  He should book now because wecan get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travelagents and --
 SAM	 Not now, Jonah.
 SAM	 We can't finish the job.  She'son her sixth painter, now she'sthinking maybe she wants thefireplace rebricked --
 VICTORIA	 I know her pretty well.  MaybeI could call her --
 SAM	 I've already solved it.  I'vehired a hit man.
 VICTORIA	 Oh that is so funny, you are sofunny.
 SAM	 Every time she wants to changesomething, she talks in thislittle baby voice --  "Couldn't you just move thestairway a teeny tiny bit?"--
 JONAH	 Do you like baseball?
 VICTORIA	 Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm hasbox seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
 JONAH	 What about camping?
 VICTORIA	 What about it?
 JONAH	 Do you like it?
 VICTORIA	 I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in abrook and floss with a weed.
 JONAH	 We ought to start campingagain, Dad.
 SAM	 Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
 JONAH	 It's only ten o'clock.
 SAM	 Jonah!
 JONAH	 Okay.
 SAM	 Thank Victoria for dinner.
 JONAH	 Thanks for dinner.  I never sawanybody cook potatoes that way.
 SAM	 I'm glad you liked it.  Goodnight, Jonah.
 ANNIE	 Hello.
 BECKY	 Turn on your radio!
 ANNIE	 What?
 BECKY	 The kid is on.  You've got melistening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
 WALTER	 Who is it?
 ANNIE	 Oh, it's just Becky, she'shaving trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm goingdownstairs.
 JONAH	 This is a complete disaster.  Iwanted him to find a wife, buthe's got the wrong one --
 ANNIE	 How am I going to explain thisto Walter?
 BECKY	 Shhh, listen to this --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Shouldn't your father be thejudge of whether she's rightor wrong?
 JONAH	 Please, please don't make mesick.  He's not sane enough tojudge anything.  She's a ho.
 JONAH	 My dad's been captured by a ho.
 VICTORIA	 Is he there?
 SAM	 No.  After he was born, every timewe started to make love, hewould cry.  He had an uncannysense of timing.  We reallyshouldn't do anything hereanyway.
 VICTORIA	 Absolutely.  Right.
 JONAH	 Oh God, it's major.  He'skissing her on the lips.  Ihave to stop this.
 ANNIE	 Come on, Jonah --
 BECKY	 Do something --
 DR. MARCIA FIELDSTONE	 Jonah, you can't butt in here.
 JONAH	 Yes, I can.
 WALTER	 Miss Scarlett.  In the broomcloset.  With the radio.
 ANNIE	 I gotta go.  I'll see you atwork.  Walter, you scared me.  Don'tever do that again.
 SAM	 Don't ever do that again.
 JONAH	 I thought I saw a black widowspider.
 SAM	 What are you doing up?
 JONAH	 I was thirsty.
 SAM	 There's a bathroom upstairs.
 JONAH	 The water tastes better in thekitchen.
 SAM	 That's true.  Why is that?
 ANNIE	 Becky heard this woman on theradio complaining about thisguy she was sure was Rick,which meant he was cheating onher.  She was completelyhysterical.  Then it turned outthe woman lived in Duluth.
 WALTER	 That doesn't make any sense.
 ANNIE	 I know.  It makes no sense atall.  Thank God my life is inplace.
 JESSICA	 Write her.
 JONAH	 You think so?
 JESSICA	 It's Y. O. H.
 JONAH	 Yeah.  What's that?
 JESSICA	 Your only hope.
 ANNIE	 I thought I would look intodoing a story about those radioshows.
 BECKY	 You'd probably have to gosomewhere to really look intoit.
 ANNIE	 Definitely.
 SAM	 Get in the car right thisminute.
 JESSICA	 I'll call you later.
 SAM	 Did you call that radio stationagain?
 JONAH	 No.
 SAM	 Everyone at work heard you.
 JONAH	 I just called for a second.
 SAM	 Long enough to call Victoria aho.
 JONAH	 It's a short word.
 SAM	 This is not a joke.  Thank GodVictoria doesn't know.  Itwould really have hurt herfeelings.
 JONAH	 If she knew, she'd neverforgive me.  It would behopeless for the two of you.
 SAM	 Don't open your mouth again. Ever.
 WALTER	 Couldn't you just do a phoneinterview?
 ANNIE	 Not for the kind of place Iwant to do.  I won't be inChicago that long.
 WALTER	 When you get back, I'll begone --
 ANNIE	 And then I'll see you in NewYork --
 WALTER	 Okay, okay.
 PILOT'S VOICE	 This is Captain Fosterwelcoming you aboard Flight 132to Seattle.  Our flying timetoday...
 ANNIE	 Do you believe that any lie isa betrayal? That's what HaroldPinter says, but it seems to meit's a very harsh way ofdrawing the line.
 VICTORIA	 Can I bring something back foryou? A souvenir?  Does he like those little snowscenes?  You know -- you shake them upand the snow floats down?
 JONAH	 Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
 VICTORIA	 Well...
 JONAH	 I think they're announcing yourflight.
 SAM	 He's ten.
 VICTORIA	 He's good at it.
 SAM	 I read an article about this
 VICTORIA	 I read the same article...
 SAM	 It takes time --
 VICTORIA	 Absolutely.  When I come back,maybe the two of us shouldspend some time together, onour own.  What do you think?
 SAM	 Sure.  Sure.
 SAM	 Jonah, this isn't fair.  Youdon't know Victoria.  I hardlyknow her myself.  She is, infact, a mystery to me.  Shetosses her hair a lot.  Whydoes she do this? I have noidea.  Is it a twitch? Doesshe need a haircut? Should sheuse barrette so it doesn'tkeep falling in her face?These are things that I'mwilling to get to the bottomof, and that is why I am datingher.  That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her.  Can youappreciate the difference?That's what single people do,they try people on and they seeif they fit.  But nobody fitsperfectly, everyone is anadjustment.
 JONAH	 Was Mom an adjustment?
 SAM	 I'm never going to meet anyonewho's going to measure up toyour mom in your eyes? What doyou think? There's a perfectwoman walking around out there?
 SAM	 There's no such thing as aperf --
 SAM	 God, she's beautiful.
 JONAH	 Victoria? She's okay.
 JONAH	 Dad, I was talking to Jessicaabout reincarnation, and shethinks that probably you knewAnnie in another life.
 SAM	 Who is Annie?
 JONAH	 The one who wrote us.
 JONAH	 But Jessica says you and Annienever got together in thatlife, and your hearts are likepuzzles with parts out of themand when you get together thepuzzle's complete.
 SAM	 God dammit.
 JONAH	 The reason I know this and youdon't is that I'm younger andpurer so I'm more in touch withcosmic forces.
 SAM	 I sincerely hope you are notgoing to marry Jessica.
 ANNIE	 Hello, Mr.  Baldwin? No. Hello, Sam?  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.  I'm Annie Reed.
 ANNIE	 I heard about you calling Dr.Fieldstone, and well, I justhappened to be out here on...
 ANNIE	 business...
 ANNIE	 vacation...
 ANNIE	 for no good reason at all...  business... and I thought I'ddrop and...  say hello...
 ANNIE	 invite you to lunch...
 ANNIE	 take a shower with you...
 ANNIE	 shoot myself.
 ANNIE	 I watched him play with his sonat the beach.
 BECKY	 Did you talk to him?
 ANNIE	 I couldn't do it.  How did Iget here?
 BECKY	 You told a lie and got on aplane.
 ANNIE	 That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over theretomorrow and talk to him.  Iam.
 BECKY	 Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
 ANNIE	 Becky?
 BECKY	 What?
 ANNIE	 Is this crazy?
 BECKY	 No.  That's the weirdest partabout it.
 ANNIE	 Thank you.  I love you.
 BECKY	 I love you, too.
 ANNIE	 Good night.
 SAM	 God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
 SUZY	 He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
 DRIVER	 Lady, what the hell are youdoing?
 SAM	 Hello.
 ANNIE	 Hello.
 ANNIE	 How could I have been such anidiot?
 BECKY	 You were standing in the middleof the street?
 ANNIE	 You know that dream whereyou're walking down the streetnaked and everyone is lookingat you?
 BECKY	 I love that dream.
 ANNIE	 That was nothing compared tothis humiliation, nothing.
 BECKY	 But he saw you, right?
 ANNIE	 He said hello.
 BECKY	 And what did you say?
 ANNIE	 All I could think of to say washello.
 BECKY	 It's a sign --
 ANNIE	 It's a sign I've watched thismovie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minuteI listen to that stupid programon the radio, I've been acomplete jerk.
 BECKY	 You don't know who she was,Annie --
 ANNIE	 I saw her.  She looked justlike this --
 BECKY	 This is a photo of hair.
 ANNIE	 Well, it's the same woman.  Andhe was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
 ANNIE	 Becky?
 BECKY	 So I mailed your letter.
 ANNIE	 "Dear Annie: Thanks for yourletter.  It was great.  We'revery excited about meeting youin New York on Valentine's Dayand seeing if we are M.F.E.O.Sleepless in Seattle."
 BECKY
 ANNIE	 Made for each other.
 BECKY	 It's cute.  It's like a littleclue.
 BECKY	 So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is ahighly overrated thing in aguy, and our pathetic need forit is what gets us into so muchtrouble.
 ANNIE	 I'm going to run back toWalter's arms, if he's stillhave me.
 BECKY	 What about the letter?
 ANNIE	 It doesn't mean anything.  Itwas written before I went outthere.  Before the ho.
 SUZY	 You saw her in the airport andthen here?
 SAM	 I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
 GREG	 Well, at least you're out thereseeing people again.  That'sterrific.
 SAM	 Well, just one really.
 SUZY	 How's Jonah taking it?
 SAM	 It'll take him a while to comearound.  A month ago he calledone of those radio call-inshows and told them I needed awife --
 SUZY	 You're kidding --
 SAM	 Now that I'm seeing someone,it's a whole other thing.
 SAM	 He's become obsessed withsome woman who wrote me --
 GREG	 Are you serious?
 SAM	 She wants to meet me at the topof the Empire State Building.
 SUZY	 It's a little derivative.
 SAM	 What do you mean?
 SUZY	 "An Affair To Remember." Didyou ever see it? Cary Grantand Deborah Kerr.  Before thatit was called "Love Affair WithIrene Dunne And Charles Boyer."
 GREG	 Women love this movie.
 SUZY	 They met at the Empire StateBuilding, only they didn't. Never mind.
 GREG	 What kind of person would writeto someone they heard on theradio?
 SAM	 I got hundreds of letters fromwomen all over the country --
 GREG	 Desperate women --
 SUZY	 Just because someone's lookingfor a nice guy doesn't makethem desperate.
 GREG	 How about rapacious and love-  starved?
 SUZY	 No.
 GREG	 It is easier to be killed by aterrorist --
 SUZY	 It is not --
 GREG	 Right, right.
 SAM	 Anyway, Victoria's nice.
 SUZY	 Would you follow her through anairport?
 SAM	 Look, I met somebody.  She'sgood, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spendyour life chasing afterfantasies.
 ANNIE	 Hi.
 SAM	 Hi.  So far so good.  So.  Whatshould we talk about? Howinsecure we were in highschool.  Shirley Votypka, thefirst girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health?Did you know that eating sixmacadamia nuts is theequivalent of eating a steak?
 ANNIE	 Shhhh --
 BECKY	 You're going to miss the train.
 ANNIE	 No, I'm not.
 BECKY	 What are your plans in NewYork?
 ANNIE	 We're going to the Rainbow Roomand the symphony tomorrow night.
 BECKY	 I love the symphony.
 ANNIE	 I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally Ifeel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything elseis what happens when you watchtoo many movies and completelylose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone aboutwhat happened.  "Sleepless inSeattle" is history.
 JESSICA	 This is the best movie I'veever seen in my life.
 JONAH	 I don't get it.
 JESSICA	 You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
 JONAH	 Do you know how much it coststo go to New York?
 JESSICA	 Nobody knows.  It changespractically every day.  Howmuch money do you have?
 JONAH	 Eighty dollars.
 JESSICA	 I have forty-two.  So thatwould definitely covertaxicabs, I think.
 JONAH	 But how am I going to getthere?
 JESSICA'S MOTHER	 Honey, I'm going out for a fewminutes.  Could you keep an eye on thingsout front till I get back?
 JESSICA	 Sure.
 JESSICA	 Do you want an aisle or awindow seat?
 JONAH	 Window.
 JESSICA	 Do you want a fruit plate?
 JONAH	 I don't know.  Do I?
 JESSICA	 I'd rather die than eat on anairplane.  I'm telling them you're twelveso you can fly unaccompaniedand they won't make you becarried around by a stewardessand everything.
 ANNIE	 You go.
 WALTER	 Ever since Christmas, you'vebeen different.  Kind ofdistracted, distant.  But Ifeel like you're coming backfrom wherever you were.
 ANNIE	 I am.  I was just... I just got... Ithink I got nervous.  It'snormal, right? Don't you everfeel nervous about, you know?
 WALTER	 What?
 ANNIE	 About forever.
 WALTER	 No.
 ANNIE	 Well, I did.  And you know whatI think? I think that it wasalmost... too perfect.
 ANNIE	 I started to wonder whether wewere the human equivalent oftwo rights making a wrong, youknow?
 ANNIE	 It was like kismet but not, ifyou see what I mean.
 ANNIE	 You have to grow up.  You can'thave all these adolescentdreams about how exciting yourlife is going to be --
 ANNIE	 Don't hate me but I love thispattern.
 ANNIE	 I do.
 WALTER	 It's just like my grandmother'schina.
 SALESWOMAN	 How many place settings shouldI put down?
 ANNIE & WALTER	 Ten.
 WALTER	 Exactly.  Eight is too few andtwelve is too many.
 ANNIE	 Walter.
 WALTER	 It was my mother's.
 ANNIE	 It's so beautiful.  It's justwhat I would have picked out ifI'd had every ring in the worldto choose from.  You see what I mean.  There arepeople who would like arelationship to be full ofsurprises, but I am not one ofthem.  Surprises are highly overrated.
 ANNIE	 Promise me something, Walter. Promise me you will never havea surprise party for me.  Ever. You know what happens, you walkin the door in some horriblesweater you put on that morning,and there are hundreds of peoplein their best clothes shouting"Surprise!"
 SAM	 Have you seen my wallet?
 JONAH	 It might be in the kitchen.
 SAM	 I'm only going to be away onenight, okay, and Clarise willbe here.  You'll have a swelltime.  You'll watch a littleGeraldo, some Nightmare on ElmStreet 12, I'll never know.
 JONAH	 Are you going with her?
 SAM	 Yes.
 SAM	 I have to have a life.  I haveto do things that I want withpeople my own age.  It's noneof your business who I am goingout with.  I don't give a goodgoddam if you're angry --
 JONAH	 This is the one I like.
 SAM	 I don't care who you like. It's who I like.  But the truthis you're never going to likeanyone because it isn't yourmother.
 JONAH	 Fine.  I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
 SAM	 Thank you, Jonah.  But thepoint is, I am not askingpermission.
 JONAH	 What's wrong with Annie?
 SAM	 Shut up.
 JONAH	 Shut up?  Shut up???  Mom neverdid that.  Mom never said shutup to me.  Mom never yelled atme.
