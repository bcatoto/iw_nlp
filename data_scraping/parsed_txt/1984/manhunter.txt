Manhunter

CRAWFORD	I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... 
GRAHAM	I don't want to talk about it anywhere. If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. 
CRAWFORD	How much do you know? 
GRAHAM	What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' Confessions? 
CRAWFORD	Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. None of them knew that; 
GRAHAM	What else did you keep out of the papers? 
CRAWFORD	Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. 
GRAHAM	Somebody hurt him? 
CRAWFORD	Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. 
GRAHAM	No. 
CRAWFORD	You look all right now. 
GRAHAM	I am all right. 
KEVIN	Will it keep them out? 
GRAHAM	Yeah. .. 
CRAWFORD	I have to. 
CRAWFORD	Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it... 
MOLLY	You wouldn't like it, either if you had it. 
CRAWFORD	Talking about 'like,' you don't like me very much, do you? 
MOLLY	No. I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'... 
CRAWFROD	I'LL try to keep him as far away from it as I can... 
GRAHAM	Thanks for the lift. 
OFFICER	I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone. 
GRAHAM	That's right. 
OFFTCER	There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for They transferred the home movies of both families once half-inch VHS. 
CONVENTIONEER #1	...like to rip me off a piece of that! 
CONVENTIONEER #2	Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds. 
MOLLY 	Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night. 
SPRINGFIELD	Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before. Can you add anything? 
GRAHAM	That's all we know about.
