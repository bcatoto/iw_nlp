Angel Eyes

SHARON	Wait. Wait. Listen to me.    Can you feel that?
SHARON	That's my hand. Hold it.    Go on -- as hard as you can.
SHARON	It's over, and I've got you, and you're safe. You're safe now. You got that? Don't let go. Don't let me go.
SHARON	That car is older than they are.
ROBBY	'67 Chevy Impala.
SHARON	That's what I said.
ROBBY	Needs a servicing.
SHARON	Don't we all.
SHARON	Get it together, officer.
ROBBY	Jesus, Pogo! Almost spilled my coffee again! You didn't like his hair, or what?
CATCH	Y'know... since we're both walking the same way, I could take one of those bags for you. That way, I do some upper body work while I'm walking along. Helps my back. What d'you say?
CATCH	Right now your mind's making pictures of me robbing your groceires, but, y'know, nine times out of ten, people do the right thing.
OLD MAN	It's the dog food that makes it so heavy.
CATCH	I guess it's worth it... for a good dog.
KID	If you're going to put me away, you gotta give me one sweet touch.
KID	That ain't the touch.   That ain't the touch I want.
ROBBY	As I remove your cuffs, I want you to put your hands here. Spread your legs. More.
ROBBY	That's it.   Back off, John, we got it.
SANDERMAN	You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?
SHARON	I just dealt with the situation. The prisoner...
SANDERMAN	And you don't see a pattern here? I want you to keep yourself way inside the line instead of walking on it. All right? Are you taking notes?
ROBBY	You broke his nose.
SHARON	He grabbed me.     End of story.
ROBBY	And you were waiting for him. You were hoping. You were making long-range plans for his ass while he was mouthing off in the car -- and you're supposed to be above that shit.
SHARON	If you think I crossed the line, put it in the report.
ROBBY	Pogo, stop the shit. What is it? You pissed off at me, too?
ROBBY
SHARON	Thanks. But  she'll invite friends, try and fix me up. She's always trying to fix me up so she doesn't have to worry about you and me.
ROBBY	She doesn't worry about that.
SHARON	They all worry about that.
SHARON	You don't need to fix me, Robby, or fix me up. I don't want some guy to heart and soul me and then walk away 'cause he can't stand the cop thing -- or worse: he wants cop stories every night 'cause it turns him on, and he has no idea who I am inside my head. Anyway, I'm busy tonight.
ROBBY	Got some action, huh?    Well, that's promising.
SHARON	Yeah.   Hot and heavy.
DRIVER	What did you say?
CATCH	What's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? Don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments -- old people, sick people?
DRIVER	You better watch your mouth, asshole.
CATCH	Why?   What're you gonna do?   Kill me?
MAN #2	Guy's nuts.   Let's go.
MRS.   VANDER	You know Dan and I   renewed our vows last year. I    bet that's where your mom got   the idea.
SHARON	Their vows?
MRS. VANDER	Your mom and dad -- the ceremony...
MRS. VANDER	Oh, well... y'know, I just got that invitation a few... just now, so I'm sure you'll...
SHARON	Oh, yeah. We've had... there's been some problems with the mail in our building, so... I'll probably get it today.
SHARON	So, I guess I'll see you.
MRS. VANDER
SHARON	I didn't see his truck, so...
LARRY	He's not here.
SHARON	How you doing?
LARRY	I'm okay.
SHARON	Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big now.
LARRY	Growin' fast.
SHARON	Is he looking more like you now -- or did he get lucky?
LARRY	He's got Kathy's looks and brains and my strong back. You should feel his grip. You just passing by?
SHARON	Place is coming along nice. The octagon window. Dad's signature.
SHARON	Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about what's happening.
LARRY	What's happening?
SHARON	So you really weren't going to tell me? Nobody was going to tell me? Mom and Dad renewing their vows, the church, the party. Mrs. Vander is all excited. She bought a new dress. It's blue.
LARRY	We're workin' on Dad. We think you should be there. We told him.
SHARON	Mom told him?
LARRY	We mentioned it.
SHARON	He's holding out, hah?
LARRY	You want to come?
SHARON	It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's over ten years, and he won't let go of it.
LARRY	You two were always head to head.
LARRY	I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here.
SHARON	Nice seeing you, too.
SHARON	Two more minutes.
KATHY	We're bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it's good to see you. It's been awhile. What?
KATHY	Oh, I went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. How're you doing?
SHARON	I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party.
KATHY	Oh. I hope you'll be there. Really.
SHARON	Take it easy.    You too, Champ.
SHARON	Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again.
RAY	Break-in alarm. One suspect in -- nobody out. Take the back.
ROBBY	Gun!
SHARON	Freeze!    Right there!
ROBBY	Hey!     Wait!
RAY	You got him?
ROBBY	He was armed.
RAY	Jesus.
ROBBY	Citizen took him down.
RAY	No shit!?
RAY	What happened here?
CATCH	I... just saw it and... I saw the gun, so...
ROBBY	You all right, Pogo?
SHARON	I was dead.   Y'know.
SHARON	He had me.    I was dead.
CATCH	I was just walking by.      I live near here.
SANCHEZ	Sergeant's going to want to talk to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a statement.
RAY	Don't worry about it. That's just procedure. Look -- we appreciate what you did. No bullshit. Let us buy you a drink tonight, all right? You know where the Rib House is?
CATCH	What day is today?
ELANORA	Wednesday.
CATCH	No.
CATCH	Met somebody today.
ELANORA	Oh? That's good. Ahh -- they had the broccolini today. Thank you.
CATCH	A woman.
ELANORA	You didn't tackle her, too, did you?
CATCH	No.
ELANORA	Good, Catch.
CATCH	She's a police officer.
ELANORA	Are you in trouble?
CATCH	No.   No trouble.
ELANORA	Well... that's a good thing.
CATCH	I saw her once a long time ago.
ELANORA	Where?
CATCH	She looks the same.
COP	Beautiful.
SANCHEZ	Yeah. My wife's got him in agility class.
RAY	No shit.
RAY	'Rex.' Rex is good. I wonder who the first person was to name a dog 'Fido,' and what the hell does it mean?
SHARON	I like how you're always asking the big questions, Ray.
RAY	I got a big question for you, Pogo -- but I can only ask it when we're alone.
SHARON	Here -- use this -- call your wife and ask her instead.
SANCHEZ	I happen to know Ray's wife is busy tonight.
RAY	Why doesn't your partner ever come out with us?
SHARON	Robby's a family man.
RAY	I'm a family man.
RAY	Where are you going?
SHARON	The head.   Do you mind?
SANCHEZ	She's just gonna freshen up her makeup.
RAY	You're wearing makeup?
SHARON	That reminds me, Ray. You still have that eye-liner you borrowed from me?
SHARON	There you are.
SHARON	We thought you wouldn't show.    Why you sitting here?
CATCH	I don't talk to a lot of people. Would you...?
SHARON	I didn't have a chance to thank you. I'm Sharon Pogue.
SHARON	You look familiar.
CATCH	I guess I live on the beat you patrol.
SHARON	Why would you do that -- jump a man with a gun?
CATCH	He was going to shoot you.
SHARON	He could've shot you. You have a death wish? You a bungee jumper?
SHARON	What d'you think about it now?
CATCH	I figure... it was worth the risk.
SHARON	For someone you don't even know?
CATCH	Yeah -- and for what you do. I think cops are great. Out there, trying to keep it safe. You know? Tough job. Firemen are everybody's heroes. Kids wave at firemen. People should wave at cops. Did you ever think about how many people are walking around this town because you saved them?
SHARON	I never thought about it.
CATCH	... because you helped them or because you arrested somebody who would've hurt them or because you just... did your job?
SHARON	Now I'm walking around this town because of you. Ever think about that? Maybe you should be a cop.
CATCH	Where do you want to be ten years from now?
SHARON	What?
CATCH	Somebody taught that to me. Kind of a shortcut. You ask somebody, what are your plans for tomorrow -- what're your dreams for ten years from now. It's supposed to get things started.
SHARON	Does it work?
CATCH	I never tried it.
SHARON	Bullshit.
CATCH	No. Really. I just remembered it -- God is my witness.
SHARON	Not in here.    It's mostly cops.
SHARON	You have a nice smile.
SHARON	So... what were we talking about? Oh, yeah, you were giving me some line about starting a conversation.
CATCH	The shortcut.
SHARON	Okay.    I'll play.
SHARON	Tomorrow I've got a night watch shift. If the weather clears, in the morning I'll go hiking. If it rains, I'll go to the gym -- and the laundromat. Ten years from now... I want to be living in some mountainous place.
CATCH	Tibet?
SHARON	Could be Tibet. Could be Colorado. Your turn.
RAY	Hey, Pogo -- don't keep him all to yourself. Come on over, Lambert, join the group. We'll buy you dinner, give you a medal for saving Pogo's ass.
SHARON	Actually, I'm kind of tired, Ray. I'm taking off.
CATCH	Oh.     I'll... walk you to your car.
CATCH	Thanks for the drink.
RAY	Least we could do. We don't like her very much -- but we don't want to lose her.
CATCH	Take care.
SHARON	It's not a great neighborhood. Maybe I should walk you to your car.
CATCH	I don't have a car.
SHARON	Want a ride home?
CATCH	Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.
SHARON	It's starting to rain.   Don't be a hero.
SHARON	Okay... ten years from now, what d'you want to be doing?
CATCH	Can you drive okay?
CATCH
CATCH	Y'know, I can picture you in Colorado.
SHARON	Oh yeah?   What am I doing there?
CATCH	Driving around... pissed off.
SHARON	I'm not pissed off at you.
CATCH	Give me some time.
SHARON	Those guys  in the bar are my friends --  sort of. We work together,  we tell jokes and we bullshit,  but I can't say to them...
CATCH	What?
CATCH	Whew. I feel like we're boxing, and you've got me on the ropes. We'll do whatever you want.
SHARON	What I want  is to know how you happened to  be walking by that parking lot  at that minute. What if you hadn' t been there?
CATCH	I guess we were supposed to meet.
SHARON	If you want -- you can come in for a minute.
SHARON	Want a drink?
CATCH	No thanks.
SHARON	Sit down or something.
CATCH	I'm circling awhile.
SHARON	You're not supposed to look around. I didn't have time to straighten up.
CATCH	So... it's more real this way.
SHARON	It's rude.
CATCH	Now that I'm in here, you seem mad about it.
SHARON	I'm not mad. You'll know when I'm mad. I don't usually let somebody in here, but here you are. That's all. Let's talk about something stupid.
CATCH	You first.
SHARON	Okay -- one thing I don't believe is that 'supposed to' business. We were 'supposed to' meet. That sounds a little fringy to me, like something you might hear on public access TV. You believe that?
CATCH	Some people say we each give off a particular odor -- that can only be detected by one other person's brain.
SHARON	So, we... smell each other?   Who says that?
CATCH	I have no idea. I'm more in the destiny school, we-met-in-another-life school. Do you believe that? Do you think when we die -- we come back in another form?
SHARON	You mean like   a duck? No. I think dead is   dead. I've been thinking about   it all day -- and I don't want to   think about it anymore.
SHARON	Why'd you do that?
CATCH	See?   Now you're thinking about me.
CATCH
SHARON	Thanks for... coming up here.
CATCH	Does that mean I'm going?
SHARON	No.    You don't have to.    I...
CATCH	You okay now?
SHARON	Oh.    You're here as a medic.
CATCH	Is this the mad part?
SHARON	Maybe going is a good idea.
CATCH	Can I come back some time?
SHARON	Why?
CATCH	Must be the smell.
CATCH	I better go.
SHARON	Oh, God.
MAN
MAN	That's my car!     What the hell were you doing?
CATCH	Nothing.    I just...
MAN	I saw you!    What did you take out of there?!
CATCH	No, I rolled up the window.       It's rain...
MAN	You take my phone?!       Hah?!
CATCH	Hey!   Hey!    Wake up!    Wake up!
CATCH	I helped you. I helped you.
CATCH	I'm sorry.
CATCH	Oh.   Sorry.
CANDACE	Shopping day?
SHARON	It's looking great, Mom.
MOTHER	Thanks, honey. It's the best year ever for the impatiens. The very best.
MOTHER	Let's go in.
SHARON	Looks the same. Still smells like cigarettes. I thought he quit.
MOTHER	He's down to six a day.
SHARON	Your hair looks nice.
MOTHER	Are you well?
SHARON	I guess I'm well. Is this always here?
MOTHER	Yes.   It's always there.
SHARON	Did Larry tell you I came by where he's working? Is that why you called me?
MOTHER	I called because we want to invite you to our renewal of vows. It's three weeks from Saturday.
SHARON	Who's 'we.'     You said 'we' want to invite you.
MOTHER	The family.
SHARON	How come you're renewing your vows?
MOTHER	It's sort of... a fresh start.
SHARON	Your idea?
MOTHER	No. Both of us. It's a way of... having the marriage blessed.
SHARON	Wasn't it blessed before?
MOTHER	Sherry... of course it was blessed. You just...
SHARON	I just what, Mom?
MOTHER	You just think about the bad, and you never remember the good. I wish you remembered the good.
SHARON	Sorry.  I wish I did, too. Does he? Remember any good about me?
MOTHER	Of course. He doesn't hate you. He just... still feels hurt.
SHARON	Hurt?    I hurt him?
MOTHER	It wasn't as bad -- you always make it sound worse. And it hasn't been that way for years.
SHARON	Mom, I'm your daughter. I don't want any trouble -- ever. I'll come to the ceremony. I won't come to argue, and I won't come in uniform.
MOTHER	It's on the 23rd. Saint Monica's.
SHARON	I'd like you to send me an invitation. Mrs. Vander said it's a beautiful invitation.
MOTHER	I'll show you.
SHARON	Mom. I'd like to get one... in the mail... from my family. Okay?
MOTHER	Yes.
SHARON	Tell Dad... thanks.
CATCH
CATCH
CATCH
SHARON
SHARON	Damn it!
SHARON	What?!     Who?!
CATCH	It's me.
SHARON	Oh, Jesus.
SHARON	I was just falling asleep. Finally.
CATCH	We made a date.
SHARON	It wasn't a 'date.'
SHARON	I need more sleep. Come back in a month.
CATCH	Come back? What makes you think I'd come back here?
SHARON	Then why are you here?
CATCH	I'm here to tell you that when you tell someone you're going to be somewhere then that someone rearranges his life and you should be more aware of that and a lot more considerate instead of just...
SHARON	What's in the bag?
CATCH	What?   None of your business.
SHARON	Did you bring some coffee?
CATCH	You think you deserve coffee?
SHARON	What else did you bring?   Food?
CATCH	You definitely don't deserve food. I've got coffee, sugar, sweetener, non-dairy...
SHARON	Just black.   Black. Thanks.
SHARON	So what kind of life did you rearrange in order to get to Denny's? You never said one word about yourself last night. What d'you do?
CATCH	What's the difference?
SHARON	What's the difference?! You're standing in my bedroom. That's the difference. Who are you?
CATCH	Somebody who keeps appointments.
SHARON	You're ducking. Don't duck. Oh, shit -- you're married, right?
CATCH	I'm not.
SHARON	I don't believe you.
CATCH	You don't believe me?   Give me back the coffee.
SHARON	No.
CATCH	Give me the coffee.
SHARON	Oh, God. Oh, wait -- you're involved in some criminal activity, aren't you? Great -- That's all I need.
CATCH	My name is Catch Lambert. I don't work. I don't commit any crimes. I like being with you. We can start from here -- from now.
CATCH	And I need to start from here.
SHARON	That's ridiculous. Why?
CATCH	That's the way it is.
SHARON	Oh.   Your rules.
CATCH	My rules.
SHARON	Jesus. Okay. Fine. I don't really want to know you anyway. Goodbye.
SHARON	Your life.    I don't want any surprises.
SHARON	That's all of it?
CATCH	Yeah. Except for you -- the way I feel about you.
SHARON	Which is?
CATCH	Surprising.    I thought it was impossible.    I thought I was...
SHARON	You thought you were what?       Gay?
CATCH	Dead.   In a way.
SHARON	I'm supposed to understand that?
CATCH	No. Did you ever wonder what 'scratch' meant, when people say, 'we'll start from scratch'? This is scratch. We can start from here.
SHARON	I don't know.    I just don't know.
CATCH	Tell her what?
ELANORA	Tell her, Catch. Tell somebody. It's been almost two years.
CATCH	Nora...
ELANORA	Every time I tell somebody, it gets a little bit easier. I'm not saying it goes...
CATCH	Nora!
ELANORA	She nice?
CATCH	She's tough.
ELANORA	She pretty?
CATCH	That doesn't matter.
ELANORA	She is pretty.
ELANORA
CATCH
ELANORA	It doesn't matter. We like it when men apologize.
CATCH	I'm sorry I yelled at you.
ELANORA	Have a cookie.     See?
SANDERMAN	Sharon...
SHARON	Lieutenant...
SANDERMAN	Anything bothering you?
SHARON	Why?   What'd I do?
SANDERMAN	Nothing. I'm talking about your general attitude lately.
SHARON	My attitude's fine. End of a long day. I'm tired.
SANDERMAN	Family matters getting to you?
SHARON	Family?!
SANDERMAN	Your brother, Larry...
SHARON	What about Larry?
SANDERMAN	You know Nester -- on the Culver City P.D.? He went out on a violent domestic dispute yesterday. A neighbor called it in. It got a little ugly. No arrest -- a warning.
SHARON	Larry.     Oh Christ.
SANDERMAN	Nester said it's not the first time.
SHARON	Thanks for telling me.
LARRY	Jesus, you're up early.
SHARON	I wanted to catch you before you went to work.
LARRY	I thought you were on late shifts.
SHARON	I don't sleep much. Can I come in?
SHARON	I'll just say hello.
KATHY	Don't make it worse.
SHARON	It gets worse?
KATHY	He's okay now. He's torn up about it. Don't make him mad.
SHARON	When Larry and I were growing up, our mother said that all the time. 'Don't make your father mad.' Has he hit Larry Jr. yet?
KATHY	He never would.
SHARON	Oh.   Just you, huh?
LARRY	What d'you think you're doing in my house, Shar? In my home.
SHARON	You see a pattern here, bro?
LARRY	I lost my temper. Things got out of hand. It won't...
SHARON	People always say that: 'I've got a temper.' Like it's an excuse.
KATHY	Don't hurt her, Lar...!
SHARON	I know how it feels, 'cause I remember. I remember standing between you and Dad and taking the blows for you -- and for what?! You turned out to be just like him, you bastard. And so did I.
LARRY	I bet you feel real proud of yourself, Shar, knocking me down in front of my family. You know what I've got in my hand? I've got a Polaroid picture of my busted-up face, and I'm thinking of sending it to your department, to your lieutenant. I'm going to turn you in to the police, Shar, and see how you like it.
SHARON	Oh, God. Oh, shit.
SHARON	It's you, right?
SHARON	Can you just shut up?    Just shut up and listen.
CATCH	I didn't say anything.
SHARON	I don't want to talk. I don't care if you have to play some game and pretend you're a... 'angel of mercy' or... whatever. I don't care, but I don't want to hear about it. All right? I don't want to hear anything.
SHARON	It's a bad night.
SHARON	This is good... but I'm too tired to stand up anymore.
SHARON	You want to kiss me?
SHARON	Kiss me someplace I've never been kissed.
SHARON	Why do you stop? You always stop.
CATCH	Drive!
SHARON
CATCH	I'm not.
SHARON	If you're in trouble with him, maybe I can help.
CATCH	Forget about him. Somebody I used to know. I don't want to know him anymore. That's all. Forget about it. Walk with me.
SHARON	This is not a great place to walk.
CATCH	I like it here. It's fine.
SHARON	I work here.   It's not fine.
CATCH	What's the problem?
SHARON	Besides the shootings, break-ins, rapes, cart thefts? We've got a loose dog raiding garbage cans, knocking 'em over. Can't catch him. Got somebody blowing a trumpet between midnight and three. Can't find him.
SHARON	You know everybody here?
CATCH	How's it goin'?
YOUNG MAN	Goin' uphill, man.
CATCH	You try it.
SHARON	Try what?
SHARON	I feel like a jerk. I feel like a smiley face.
OLD MAN	Mornin'.
MOM	Go on.
MOM	Move your arm!
MOM	What are you staring at?
CATCH	She feels bad 'cause you yelled at her.
MOM	It's none of your business!
CATCH	Why not smile at her?   What's it cost?
MOM	Who the hell are you to talk to me?!
CATCH	You're so damn impatient.
WOMAN	Get away from me!
CATCH	You're so busy being pissed off, and time is going by.
WOMAN	What?!
CATCH	It's not her fault.
WOMAN	I'm calling the police!
CATCH	No.  I'm calling the police. Hey -- police.
SHARON	Jesus Christ, Catch.
CATCH	Maybe she'll think about it now.
SHARON	Blind to what?!
SHARON	Or like me, right? What about you? How come you can see?
SHARON
CATCH	I'll call you later -- about the hiking.
SHARON	I'll be out.
CATCH	Shar... wait.    Hey!
CATCH	Do we go for... symmetry? Or... more off-center. Japanese.
CATCH	Are you into this? Bob?
LARRY	I don't want you around here.
SHARON	Let's go talk in the yard.
SHARON	You took a swing at me.
LARRY	You asked for it -- calling me a coward. You knew I'd swing. You think I look bad now? Look at this.
LARRY	Nice, huh? Beautiful. The cops'll love this, right? Evidence. Don't you guys love evidence?
LARRY	You wanted me to swing.
SHARON	I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
LARRY	But you're not sorry you hit me.
SHARON	Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's face?!
LARRY
SHARON	Don't go to my department, all right?
LARRY	Why the hell not?
SHARON	Larry...
LARRY	Why not?!
SHARON	Because the job's all I got.
LARRY	And I don't want you to come to Mom and Dad's celebration...
LARRY	Not the church. Not the party. Stay away. I don't want you around. I don't want to see you, Shar.
LARRY	Go get a life.
SHARON	I got a life!
SHARON	How the hell would you know about my life?!
LARRY	I know.
CATCH	Hey. Hey!   Can you wait up a minute?!
SHARON	I thought you walked all over the city.
CATCH	The city is flat. Okay? Can we stop here? Can we examine the view? Have a Milky Way? I've burned every calorie I ever had.
SHARON	My favorite lunch spot is another half mile.
CATCH	Up?!
CATCH	I'm not one of those competitive guys, you know!
CATCH	No thanks. I can't eat and have a heart attack at the same time.
CATCH	As soon as you get happy, you get sad.
SHARON	I'm okay.   Everything's code four.
CATCH	Everything's what?
SHARON	Everything's fine.
CATCH	Fine? This isn't fine. I know fine. This is something else. Something happened yesterday.
SHARON	Yesterday -- you mean you want to hear about it?
CATCH	Sure I do.
SHARON	No kidding. Why? You never talk about yesterday.
CATCH	All my days are the same.
SHARON	Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we rolled on a 415. Juliette and Sanchez had these four guys against a wall, but they were H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It got pretty jumpy, but we got them in the car with a couple of bruises and Robby got a sprained wrist, so I did the rest of the shift with a rookie who lost it over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old woman who'd been dead maybe six, seven days, and I usually do all right but the smell got to me, and I can still smell her. Then we arrested a prostitute working out of her home, and I carried her little girl out to the social worker, and the kid was holding on real tight and making my shoulder wet and I wanted to punch her rock-head mother, and then shift ended and I had a nice visit with my brother Larry.
CATCH	I'm sorry. That would make anybody sad.
SHARON	Sorry you asked?
CATCH	No.   No, you can always tell me.
SHARON	Well... I feel better now.    You feel better?
CATCH	I feel fine.   Great.
SHARON	What are you doing?!
SHARON	Catch! There's no swimming here! And you can't be naked in a state park!
CATCH	Take the day off, Pogo!
SHARON	What if a park ranger comes?!
CATCH	Take your badge off for once. Don't be such a damn Marine about everything. Just...
CATCH	Someplace I've never been kissed.
CATCH	They tell me I was in an accident. Long time ago.
SHARON	Looks like a bad one.
CATCH	I don't remember it.    I...
SHARON	We should be thinking about lunch. We have to pack up.
CATCH	So soon?
SHARON	Some of us have to work. You ever work?
SHARON	Oh?   You remember that?   Working?
JACK	Catch -- Jesus!
JACK	Okay. All right. So... what d'you want, a coffee?
CATCH	I want my old job back. What d'you think?
JACK	You been workin'?
CATCH	No, but I'm up to speed.
JACK	Well, it's not good with Randal anymore.
CATCH	No?
JACK	No, he's out of it, but Danny Coley's got something going. Wanna go see 'im?
CATCH	Finish your coffee.
SHARON	I have to check these jacket pockets. What's your name -- Allison?
SHARON	I need to unsnap this, Allison. I'm checking your waistband. You got to Whitney School?
ALLISON	St. Mark's.
SHARON	Lift your arms higher. Got a good basketball team at St. Mark's. You play basketball?
SHARON	He says before I came along, he thought he was dead. Sounds better when he says it -- Listen.
ROBBY	What?
SHARON	Shhh.   Sh!
SHARON	The trumpet player.
ROBBY	This time we got his ass.
SHARON	Wow.
ROBBY	Got 'im?
SHARON	Look at that moon.
ROBBY	Full moon, man. Hey!
DRIVER	This guy's crazy!
BAT-MAN	This asshole side-swiped me!
SHARON	Are you McGuire?
BAT-MAN	What?!
SHARON	Mark McGuire?
BAT-MAN	No.
SHARON	Then put that bat away.   Put it in your trunk. Now.
DRIVER	I never touched his car.

SHARON
CATCH	I better... More oil.
CATCH	This is pretty.
SHARON	Don't get oil on it.
CATCH	Renewal of vows -- that's great. Is this your parents?
CATCH	Why not?
SHARON	If I go, my brother'll hurt    me with the department. I got     mad and knocked him down. All     they need is a complaint. Just     leave it alone and keep rubbing.     Okay?
CATCH	So... he says you can't go?
SHARON	Can't you rub without talking? It's been bad with my family a long time, so the hell with it anyway. If they don't want me there, I don't want to be there. All right?
CATCH	All right. Bad how?
SHARON	Oh, Jesus!
SHARON	My father used to knock us around, all of us. But I'm the one who called the cops -- finally. They say I turned against the family.
CATCH	But... they invited you.
SHARON	You don't know anything about it. So forget it.
CATCH	Well... I know about family.
SHARON	Oh, yeah?   What about it?
CATCH	It's... a door you don't close.
SHARON	I didn't close the door.
CATCH	You're closing it now. Right? Family invites you, you go. Family shows up, you welcome them in. That's family.
CATCH	Then you forgive.
SHARON	You have all the answers.
CATCH	No. I just... It seems like a chance, doesn't it? A chance to make things right. I'd take it. Then you tried -- y'know? And it's up to them.
SHARON	You close with your family?
CATCH
SHARON	Oh, God.
RAY	Are you in danger there?
SHARON	Go away.
RAY	I was talking to him, Pogo.

BIKER	Why the hell did you cause a wreck?! I told you -- I saw the kid, you idiot. I was...
CATCH	One more word, and your life will change forever.
SHARON	Catch!   Catch!
SHARON	Are you all right? Your elbow's bleeding. I...
SHARON	What's wrong?
SHARON	Where are you going? Catch -- you're scaring me. Please...
SHARON	Please, Catch, don't... Can't you talk to me?!
SHARON	Please.   Wait.     I... Catch!
ROBBY	Are you going to tell me why we're sitting outside this building again?
ROBBY	What's it about?
SHARON	It's personal.
ROBBY	Fine -- what am I supposed to do?

CATCH
ELANORA
ELANORA	Catch?
CATCH	I'll call you.
SHARON	Give me fifteen.
PINDELLA	Excuse me -- that's a private entrance...
PINDELLA	Oh... is there a problem?
SHARON	I'm not sure.    Who am I speaking to?
PINDELLA	I'm Dr. Pindella.
SHARON	What kind of doctor?
PINDELLA	What is this?
SHARON	Do you know a Catch Lambert?
PINDELLA	Oh.   Yes!   Is he in trouble?
SHARON	I... need to talk to you.
PINDELLA	Well, I have a patient in five minutes. But I can...
SHARON	Are you a...?
PINDELLA	I'm a psychiatrist.
SHARON	And Mr. Lambert...
PINDELLA	My relationship with Mr. Lambert is confidential.
SHARON	He's your patient. He's your patient we... know all this. This is police business. I'm officer Sharon Pogue -- L.A.P.D.
PINDELLA	Look... I want to help Mr. Lambert but I can't tell you anything that isn't public record.
SHARON	In general. In general.   He's your patient, and he...
PINDELLA	He's not my patient. He walked away from treatment. That was... nearly a year ago.
SHARON	Why did he walk away?
PINDELLA	I can't discuss that, but if you know how to reach him, I would appreciate being able to talk to him.
SHARON	More.
PINDELLA	I can tell you he was in an accident, hospitalized, referred to me as an outpatient...
SHARON	What accident?
PINDELLA	A bus... a city bus hit his vehicle. That was a couple of years ago. It was... an awful thing. His family was in the van. His wife and child. His wife's parents...
SHARON	A bus... and a van. Where?        On... the freeway?
PINDELLA	I think so. Yes. Near Santa Monica.  On the freeway. He was severely injured but... thrown clear.  The others were trapped in the van.
SHARON	Survivors?   Only him?      I... don't remember.
PINDELLA	Remember?
SHARON	Yes.   I was there. I was there.
PINDELLA	His wife's mother survived, but... she was paralyzed.
PINDELLA	Elanora Chu.   She's still in town, I believe.
SHARON	Does he... still see her?
PINDELLA	He used to. I don't know. I'm glad to see... he has someone else who cares about him. I know he's running from this. He left all his friends, his home, his whole life.
SHARON	He says... he doesn't remember the accident.
PINDELLA	He lost a lot of memory. I tried to help him with that. He resisted. Walked away.
SHARON	I think he remembers me.
SHARON	How does he live?
SHARON	Catch, it's me. Can you pick up?
SHARON	Why don't we... meet tomorrow? I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o'clock. Okay?
CATCH	Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.
SHARON	That's okay.
CATCH	It's hard to explain, but it's... I'm okay now.
SHARON	You don't have to explain.
CATCH	So... why'd we meet here?
SHARON	So you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat.
CATCH	I used to practice late... outside. On my roof.
SHARON	On your roof? That's why we couldn't find you.
CATCH	I didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it. You arresting me?
SHARON	Like I held you before.   Like I did -- at the accident.
SHARON	What makes it so... unspeakable, Catch? What makes it like that?
SHARON	Is it because you were driving?
SHARON	I read the reports, and it wasn't your fault. It wasn't. Is it because you survived and they didn't?
SHARON	Catch. Please. Hold on, and we'll go in there together...
SHARON	You can talk to them. You can say goodbye or I love you or whatever...
CATCH	This is wrong! It's wrong!   Why are you doing this?!
SHARON	To help you.
CATCH	I don't need your help! I don't need this. We don't need this -- we're fine...
SHARON	We're not. We're not fine, Catch. Nothing is fine -- no matter how much you pretend.
SHARON	You pretend that nothing happened. You walk all over the city helping people, but you're dying inside.
CATCH	I'm not dying! I'm not pretending! I don't remember! I don't remember any of it. So leave me alone! What good does it do? It's gone! And I'm all right this way! Why do you have to change it? I'm all right.
SHARON	Then walk in there.
SHARON	Walk in there, and I'll walk in with you. Walk in there and say it's real -- what happened is real. Your family died.
CATCH	Don't talk about that!    Don't!
SHARON	So you can have a life!
SHARON	Because it happened! Because it's the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry it happened, but...
CATCH	Nothing happened! If we say it, then that's the truth, that can be the truth. Say it. Nothing happened. Say it, Shar.
SHARON	Catch -- take my hand.    Please.
CATCH	Say it!    I'm asking you to say it.
SHARON	I can't.
CATCH	Why not?
SHARON	Because I want it too much. I want everything with you. I want all of you -- not just the part that isn't hiding and running away...
CATCH	Why are   you pushing so hard? Why does it   have to be your way? Why does it   have to be your truth? This is   who I am! This is the way I am!
SHARON	Not anymore. It doesn't have to be this way anymore because you're not alone -- because we're the family now. We can be the family...
CATCH	You like to push people, don't you? You just have to push and shove and make it right for you -- for you. You push everybody, Shar. You even pushed your family away, didn't you?
SHARON	I just... want to say...
CATCH	You already said it.   You said it all.
SHARON	When you're ready, I'll be there for you. I just want to say that.
RAY	Rib House after shift today?
ROBBY	I think I'll head home.
RAY	Pogo?   Bring your friend.
SHARON	No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.
SHARON	There's something I have to do.    I need an address and phone.
ROBBY	What's the name?
SHARON	Elanora Chu.
ROBBY	Let's do it.
ELANORA	Pogo?
SHARON	I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all about the...
ELANORA	Elanora.
SHARON	I'm sorry for... what happened.     I know about the accident.
ELANORA	He told you?!
ELANORA	Oh.   Yes.
SHARON	I guess he comes here a lot -- to talk to you.
ELANORA	He shops for me. Twice a week.
SHARON	Oh. And when he comes here -- he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident?
ELANORA	No.
SHARON	And you... let him do that?    All this time? Why?
ELANORA	It's what he needs.
SHARON	Walking all over the city like...
ELANORA	Like an angel.     Yes. Sweet man.
SHARON	But... you let him get so lost.
ELANORA	I let him find his own way through it. Why did you come here, Sharon?
SHARON	Because... I want to know how to help him.
ELANORA	You are helping him.
SHARON	I don't think so.
ELANORA	Why not?
SHARON	He... he was paying me back, I guess, for the accident, for helping him. That's why he felt... so close to me. But...
ELANORA	Is that what you think?
SHARON	But now he probably hates me.
ELANORA	What happened?
SHARON	I took him to the cemetery, and...
ELANORA	The cemetery!
SHARON	I thought it might help him... come back, you know? But he wouldn't even go in. He screamed at me.
ELANORA	What made you take him there?
SHARON	For the truth...
ELANORA	He knows the truth.
SHARON	But he won't even say it, or...
ELANORA	That's his way. That's his way through all this. He made a wall -- around that whole day, that night -- other things, too. He keeps them behind the wall -- his little boy, my daughter. He can't help it. The cemetery?! Do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? Can you imagine?
ELANORA	That's where it stares you in the face -- the loss. And it's too much sometimes.
ELANORA	See? I'm still finding my way through it. And Catch -- it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery.
SHARON	I was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. I...
ELANORA	But he was coming back. Do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? His apartment, his life, his music is coming back. He fell in love! He even got a job, Sharon -- for you. For the two of you. Isn't that coming back? Why do you have to rush? Everybody has to rush these days.
SHARON	I was scared. I push so hard... when I'm scared.
ELANORA	Scared of what?
SHARON	Losing him. So I did. I lost him. He won't talk to me. I... I didn't know what I was doing.
ELANORA	You were finding your way.    What else can we do? You think    I'm always sure what to say to   him, what not to say? I do what    I think is right and hope he   sees the love in it.
ELANORA	Look at you -- so worried now, so miserable. That's the love in it.
SHARON	Did I... make it worse for him?
ELANORA	I don't know. I really don't. But I think he'll see the love in what you did.
SHARON	I just came by to... wish you well. To... congratulate you and wish you well. Shit.

KATHY	She came.
KATHY	Don't say anything.   Think of your parents.
CATCH	Annie. Chet. I don't... want you to think I forgot about you. It's just that I... I couldn't find you. I woke up, and you were gone. Everything was gone. It all just... disappeared. In one minute. I couldn't remember that minute. I lost it. It took me so long to find it. I think I found it all now. I used a calculator. I did. I figured it out. You know... we get about 1400 minutes a day and so I figured it out. I was 33 years old and three months and eight days, so it was... I've got it here...
CATCH	It was minute number 17 million eight hundred ten thousand, two hundred... or so.
CATCH	That's the one I lost. And... when I lost that minute, I guess I tried to lose it all, all the memories -- because they hurt. I tried, but... I couldn't do it.
CATCH	And then we all smiled, and it was a great minute. It was. I'm really glad... I found that minute. No matter what.
CATCH	I won't forget... anymore.     I love you.
SHARON	Where do you want me?
SHARON	I'm the daughter.
PHOTOGRAPHER	Oh!   Oh, well, how about...
SHARON	You both look so great.
MOTHER	You, too.
SHARON	I just wanted to...
FATHER	You coming to the party?
SHARON	Sure.
MRS. VANDER	Sherry!    Look how nice you look.
HUSBAND	Big police officer now.
SHARON	Not so big. Nice dress.
SHARON	Larry...
LARRY	How did you have the guts to walk into a church after breaking your word?
SHARON	I have to be here. It's a chance to make things right, and I'm taking it.
LARRY	Why even talk go me? You got what you wanted. You laugh about it? You tell your cop friends how you...
MOTHER	Don't make him talk about... anything today.
SHARON	Mom, I was going to fix his tie. His tie is crooked.
SHARON	It was a nice ceremony.
MOTHER	Yes. We're running out of chicken, though. Nobody's eating the ham.
SHARON	It's a great party, Mom.   You look happy.
SHARON	Thirty-five years and still in love, huh?
MOTHER	You think that's wrong, don't you?
SHARON	Of course not...
MOTHER	I always... I feel like apologizing to you. But I love him.
MOTHER	And then I feel like apologizing to him for loving you. I'm the one in the middle. I'm the only one in this family who knows how to forgive anybody.
BOTH	You look great.
KATHY	Tons of makeup. On Larry, too.
SHARON	Sorry about that, but... I couldn't stand him doing that to you. I took it on...
KATHY	Don't worry. I'm not your mother. If he tries it again, I'm gone. I'm out of there, me and Larry Junior. He knows that.
LARRY JR.
LARRY JR.
LARRY
LARRY	Stay away from my family.
LARRY	Hey, everybody, keep it down. Somebody might call the police.
SHARON	What're you doing?
LARRY	Once the cops leave, we can really party.
LARRY	Why don't you give everybody a break -- and go home?
SHARON	Don't walk away. Okay?
FATHER	What?
SHARON	Is it working?     Do you need to check it?
FATHER	It's fine.
SHARON	Dad...
LARRY	What the hell are you doing?!
MOTHER	Sharon, please.
SHARON	Please? Please what?! Will you stop protecting him? You were always protecting him! Don't talk to your father. Don't bother your father!
SHARON	I'm going to bother you for one minute, Dad. Okay? Can you handle that?
LARRY	Just get the hell out...
FATHER	Up to you.
SHARON	Dad... I'm asking. Am I welcome here?
FATHER	Jesus -- you're here, aren't you? What d'you want?
SHARON	I want to know! Do you want me here? Do you love me, Dad? I want to know.
SHARON	Do you... need to... check that again?
FATHER	I feel like...
SHARON	What, Dad?   You feel like what?
FATHER	I feel like I don't have a daughter anymore.
SHARON	Well... you do. It's a shame you're going to miss knowing her. You're going to miss all that.
SHARON	I'm next.
SHARON	Hi, Mom and Dad. Congratulations.
SHARON	Y'know... being in this house reminds me of something.  I was about ten, I guess, and Larry and I were playing aliens -- remember, Lar? We're making a lot  of noise, and Dad comes home from work tired and pissed off...
SHARON	We're yelling like mad, and Dad bursts into the room and says, what the hell are you doing? And I'm scared. I'm really scared.
SHARON	And I say, we're playing alien invasion, Dad, and he says, oh, yeah, I'll show you a damn invasion, and he picks me up, picks me up off the floor and throws me on the couch. I hit that couch and bounce off, and he grabs Larry and throws him on the couch, and then... then he starts making these monster sounds, and he says, we came to earth to kick ass, and I run at him and jump on him and he tosses me on the couch and then Larry, and we're laughing so hard I almost wet myself, and he keeps tossing us and growling and beeping, and it was... it was great. It was great, and I'm never going to forget that. Never. And I miss that. I miss it. So I just... I wanted to tell you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks. That's all. Bye.
CATCH	Sorry, Shar.   For what I said.
SHARON	Me, too.
CATCH	Was it bad?
SHARON	They don't like me in there.
CATCH	Then they don't deserve you in there.
SHARON	That's a nice thing to say.
CATCH	It's not a thing to say.   It's the truth.
CATCH	Why do you try so hard not to cry?
SHARON	It's not fair.
SHARON	It's not fair. Things got better for them because of what I did. Things got better, and I'd still do it. I'd do it all over again. And it's not fair they shut me out. It's not.
CATCH	No.
SHARON	It's not fair. I was     19, and I didn't know what else    to do. I didn't know how else    to stop it. It's not fair I don't    have a family anymore.
CATCH	No.   It's not, Shar.    It's not.
