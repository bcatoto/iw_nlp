Memento

LEONARD	So where are you? You're in some motel room.
LEONARD	Looks like somebody's home.
TEDDY	That thing's been here for years.
LEONARD	I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't more than a few days old. Let's take a look inside.
LEONARD	I've finally found him. How long have I been looking?
TEDDY	Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, yeah? Fuck this.
LEONARD	YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG
TEDDY	You don't have a clue, you freak.
LEONARD	Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
TEDDY	Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
LEONARD	Teddy!
TEDDY	You read it off your fucking photo. You don't know me, you don't even know who  you are.
LEONARD	I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
TEDDY	    (bloody grin) That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
LEONARD	Shut your mouth!
TEDDY	Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.     (intimate) C'mon, Lenny - we'll take a look down there together. Then you'll know. You'll know what you really are.
LEONARD	So you're in some motel room... ... you don't know how long you've been there, or how you got there...
BURT	That guy's here already.
TEDDY	 Lenny!
LEONARD	It's Leonard... like I told you before.
TEDDY	Did you? I musta forgot. I'm Teddy.
LEONARD	    (smiles) I guess I've told you about my condition.
TEDDY	Only every time I see ya!
LEONARD	My car.
TEDDY	This is your car.
LEONARD	    (shakes head) You're in a playful mood. Shouldn't make fun of somebody's   handicap.
TEDDY	Just trying to have a little fun.
TEDDY	Roll your window up, will ya?
LEONARD	It's broken.
TEDDY	I can get that fixed for you. So where are we going, Sherlock?
LEONARD	I got a lead on a place.
TEDDY	    (surprised at the note) What the hell you want to go there for?
LEONARD	You know it?
TEDDY	Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.     Why are we going there?
LEONARD	    (smiling) I don't remember.
LEONARD	Looks like somebody's home.
LEONARD	Nothing except the Gideon Bible.
BURT	Hiya.
LEONARD	I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
BURT	What can I do for you, Leonard?
LEONARD	I'm sorry... um... ?
BURT	Burt.
LEONARD	Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -
BURT	You don't know?
LEONARD	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
BURT	   (nods) You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember?
LEONARD	That's the thing. I have this condition.
BURT	Condition?
LEONARD	I have no memory.
BURT	Amnesia?
LEONARD	No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably... I've told you this before, haven't I?
BURT	   (nods) I don't mean to mess with you. It's just so weird. You don't remember me at all, and we talked a bunch of times. What's the last thing you remember?
LEONARD	My wife.
BURT	    (fascinated) What's it like?
LEONARD	Like waking. Like you always just woke up.
BURT	That must suck. All... backwards.  Well, like.. you gotta pretty good idea of what you're gonna do next, but no idea    what you just did.      (chuckles)     I'm the exact opposite.
LEONARD	    (focuses on Burt) How long have I been here?
BURT	Couple days.
LEONARD	So you're holding my calls?
BURT	As requested.
LEONARD	Okay, but this guy's an exception. Know this guy?
BURT	Your friend, right?
LEONARD	What makes you think he's my friend?
BURT	Seen you together, that's all.
LEONARD	He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
BURT	Sure. But nobody else, right?
LEONARD	Just this guy. I hope my condition won't be a problem for you.
BURT	Not if you remember to pay your bill. That guy's here already.
WAITER	Sir? You left these at your table.
LEONARD	Thanks. Lincoln Street?
WAITER	You wanna go east on sixth.     (points) Just keep straight, all the way out of town, then take a right.
TEDDY	Yup?
LEONARD	Mr Gammell?
TEDDY	Lenny, is that you?
LEONARD	John Gammell?
TEDDY	Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
LEONARD	I'll be waiting.
LEONARD	Who is this?     (listens)  And we spoke earlier? I don't remember  that.     (listens) Well, yeah, but it's not amnesia. I     remember everything from before my injury, I just can't make any new memories.     (listens)
LEONARD	Natalie.
NATALIE	You don't remember me.
LEONARD	    (friendly smile) Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
NATALIE	You did explain, Lenny.
LEONARD	Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
NATALIE	You told me.
LEONARD	Then I probably told you how much I hated  it. Could you take off your sunglasses? It's just hard for me -
NATALIE	Yeah.
LEONARD	So you have information for me?
NATALIE	Is that what your little note says?
LEONARD	Yes.
NATALIE	Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear. But I guess that's why you got those freaky tattoos.
LEONARD	It is tough. Almost impossible. I'm sorry I can't remember you. It's not personal.
NATALIE	I'm sorry. I do have information for you. You gave me a license plate number? I had my friend at the DMV trace it. Guess what name came up.
LEONARD	You know him?
NATALIE	No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before This is a copy of his registration, license, photo and all. Are you sure you want this?
LEONARD	Have I told you what this man did?
LEONARD	Then you shouldn't have to ask.
NATALIE	But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
LEONARD	    (annoyed)  So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.       (calms)    The world doesn't disappear when you    close your eyes, does it? My actions    still have meaning, even if I can't     remember them. My wife deserves    vengeance, and it doesn't make any difference whether I know about it.
NATALIE	Tell me about her again.
LEONARD	Why?
NATALIE	Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
LEONARD	She was beautiful. Perfect to me -
NATALIE	Don't just recite the words. Close your eyes, remember her.
LEONARD	You can only feel details. Bits and pieces which you didn't bother to put into words. And extreme moments you feel even if you don't want to. Put it together and you get the feel of the person, enough to know how much you miss them, and how much you hate the person who took them away.
NATALIE	I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
LEONARD	Deals?
NATALIE	It's isolated.
LEONARD	Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
NATALIE	I wasn't helping you for money.
LEONARD	Sorry.
NATALIE	It's not your fault. See, you have this condition... Are you still at the Discount Inn? Room 304? You left this at my place.
LEONARD	The Discount Inn, yeah.
NATALIE	They treating you alright?
LEONARD	   (smiling) Don't remember.
NATALIE	You know what we have in common? We're both survivors. Take care, Leonard.
LEONARD	I met Sammy through work.     (listens) Insurance. I was an investigator. I'd   investigate claims to see which ones    were phony.    I had to see through people's bullshit. It was useful experience, because now it's my life. When I meet someone, I don't even know if I've met them before. I have to look in their eyes and just figure them out. My job taught me that the best way to find out what someone knew was to let them talk.
LEONARD(V.0.)	Throw in the occasional "why?" but just listen. And watch the eyes, the body     language. It's complicated. You might catch a sign but attach the wrong meaning to it. If someone touches their nose while they're talking, experts will tell you it means they're lying. It really means they're nervous, and people get nervous for all sorts of reasons. It's all about context.
LEONARD	I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
BURT	    (looks up) Hi, Leonard. Probably in the room.
LEONARD	I don't see my key.
BURT	Shit. Wrong room.
LEONARD	What?
BURT	This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
LEONARD	This isn't my room?
BURT	No, let's go.
LEONARD	Then why is this my handwriting?
BURT	This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
LEONARD	When was I in here?
BURT	Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
LEONARD	Why?
BURT	Business is slow. I told my boss about You, about your condition. He told me to Try and rent you another room.
LEONARD	Why didn't you clean it out?
BURT	    (shrugs) You're still paying for it. It's still Your room.
LEONARD	So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
BURT	Just two. So far.
LEONARD	Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me.
BURT	Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway.
LEONARD	You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
BURT	Leonard. Always get a receipt.
LEONARD	I'm gonna write that down.
LEONARD	I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident... nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on.
LEONARD(V.O.)	The doctors find some possible damaqe to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive. But Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple minutes. He can't work, can't do shit, medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in.
LEONARD	My first big claims investigation - I really check into it. Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories, he can only remember things for a few minutes.
LEONARD	He'd watch T.V., but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing, he couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials. They were short.
LEONARD	... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing.
MRS JANKIS  	Gentle.
LEONARD	The doctors assure me that there's a real condition called Korsokoff's syndrome; short-term memory loss, rare but legit. But every time I see him I catch a look of recognition. Just a slight look, but he says he can't remember me at all.
LEONARD	His wife has to do everything. Sammy can only do simple stuff. He couldn't pick up any new skills at all, and that's how I got him.
TEDDY	Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?
LEONARD	Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
TEDDY	You said you were leaving town.
LEONARD	Things change.
TEDDY	So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
LEONARD	Guess I've told you about my condition.
TEDDY	    (grins) Only every time I see ya! Come on, I'll buy you lunch.
TEDDY	Not hungry?
LEONARD	    (shrugs) It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
TEDDY	You don't have to remember to be hungry.
LEONARD	It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
TEDDY	Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
LEONARD	Who?
TEDDY	The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right? Leonard, you need to be very careful.
LEONARD	Why?
TEDDY	Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
LEONARD	Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
TEDDY	Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
LEONARD	Why?
TEDDY	Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
LEONARD	Memory's unreliable. No, really. Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police, eyewitness testimony is unreliable. The cops don't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff. They collect facts, make notes, draw conclusions. Facts, not memories: that's how you investigate. I know, it's what I used to do. Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.
TEDDY	You really want to find this guy?
LEONARD	He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
TEDDY	You're living.
LEONARD	Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
 TEDDY	We'll find him. Where are you staying?
LEONARD	Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
TEDDY	Probably left it in your room.
LEONARD	I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
BURT	    (looks up) Hi, Leonard.
LEONARD	So Sammy can't learn any new skills. But I find something in my research: Conditioning. Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition. It's how  you learn stuff like riding a bike, things you don't think about, you just get better through practice. Call it muscle memory, whatever, but it's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory. So I have the doctors test Sammy's response to conditioning...
DOCTOR	Just pick up any three objects.
SAMMY	    (amused) That's a test? Where were you guys when I did my CPA?
DOCTOR	It's a test, Sammy.
LEONARD	Some of the objects were electrified, They'd give him a small shock.
LEONARD	They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct.
LEONARD	Sorry. It's only me.
NATALIE	Sleep okay?
LEONARD	Yeah. You?
NATALIE	I gotta be someplace. Pretty weird.
LEONARD	Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand?
NATALIE	    (through mirror)     I should be able to talk to my friend   about the license plate today.
LEONARD	Yeah, the license plate...
NATALIE	    (smiles)   John G's license plate number. You have it tattooed on your thigh.
NATALIE	If it's registered in this state it'll  just take seconds to pull up his license and registration. I'll call when I've spoken to him.
 LEONARD	Why don't we just arrange a meeting now?     I'm not too good on the phone.
NATALIE	    (smiles) I'm helping you because you helped me. So will you remember me next time you seo me? I think you will.
LEONARD	    (smiles) I'm sorry.
NATALIE	    (amused) Lenny, before you go, can I have my shirt back please?
TEDDY	Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back?
LEONARD	They kept testing Sammy for months, always with the same objects carrying the electrical charge...
SAMMY	Ah! What the fuck?!
DOCTOR	It's a test, Sammy.
SAMMY	Ah! What the fuck?!
DOCTOR	It's a test, Sammy.
SAMMY	Yeah? Test this you fucking quack.
LEONARD	Even with total short-term memory loss, Sammy should've learned to instinctively stop picking up the wrong objects. All previous cases of short-term memory loss had responded to conditioning in some way. Sammy didn't respond at all.
LEONARD	It was enough to suggest his condition was psychological not physical.
LEONARD	Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?
NATALIE	Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
LEONARD	    (snaps) Who is he? What have you got me into?
NATALIE	Come inside.
NATALIE	Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
LEONARD	That's the problem! How can I find John G. when I don't know what's going on?! How did you get me into this?!
NATALIE	Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
LEONARD	How do I know he did that to you?
NATALIE	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
LEONARD	So I just take your word?
NATALIE	Yes.
LEONARD	    (sighs) Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
NATALIE	Did you?
LEONARD	What?
NATALIE	Kill him.
LEONARD	Course not.
NATALIE	This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
LEONARD	You have to burn them.
NATALIE	You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
LEONARD	There are things you know for sure.
NATALIE	Such as?
LEONARD	I know the feel of the world.     (reaches forward) I know how this wood will sound when I knock.     (raps knuckles on coffee table) I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.     (handles glass) Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.     (runs hands over objects) I know the feel of the world,     (beat) and I know her.
NATALIE	Your wife?
LEONARD	She's gone and the present is trivia, which I can scribble down as notes.
NATALIE	Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
LEONARD	It's not easy to be calm when -
NATALIE	Just relax. You don't seem the type. Come on. It's backwards.
LEONARD	It's... it must be for when I've found him.
LEONARD	I'm sorry.
NATALIE	His name was Jimmy.
LEONARD	What happened?
NATALIE	He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
LEONARD	Who did he go to meet?
NATALIE	A guy called Teddy.
LEONARD	What do the police think?
NATALIE	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy. When you find this guy, this John G., what are you going to do?
LEONARD	Kill him.
NATALIE	Maybe I can help you find him. I know a lot of people.
LEONARD	I don't even know how long she's been   gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow I just    know that she'll never come back to bed.     I lie here, not knowing how long I've been alone. If I could just reach out and    touch her side of the bed I could know  that it was cold, but I can't. I have no     idea when she left. I know I can't have her back, but I want     to be able to let her go. I don't want to wake up every morning thinking she's still here then realizing that she's not. I want time to pass, but it won't. How  can I heal if I can't feel time?
LEONARD	Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her.
LEONARD	I never said that Sammy was faking. Just that his problem was mental, not physical. But she... she couldn't understand. She looks into his eyes and sees the same person. And if it's not a physical problem...
LEONARD	... he should just... snap out of it.
LEONARD	Awake. Where am I? Motel room. Some anonymous motel room. Nothing in the drawers, but you look anyway.
TEDDY	Finished playing with yourself, Lenny?
LEONARD	Why are you here?
TEDDY	    (surprised) You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. Who the fuck is that?
LEONARD	You don't know him?
TEDDY	No! Should I? Is this John G.?
LEONARD	I don't think so.
TEDDY	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
LEONARD	I might have fallen asleep before I did.
TEDDY	Ask him.
LEONARD	What's your name?
MAN	Dodd.
LEONARD	Who did this to you?
DODD	    (confused) What?
LEONARD	Who did this to you?
DODD	You did.
TEDDY	I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
LEONARD	No. No, just let me think for a minute. Here we go.
TEDDY	Natalie? Natalie who?
LEONARD	Why?
TEDDY	I think I know her.
LEONARD	We've got to get him out of here.
TEDDY	He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
LEONARD	We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
TEDDY	How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
LEONARD	I don't know. Yes I do... this isn't my room. It's his. He was already here. Let's just    go.
TEDDY  	Wait, we can't just leave him. The maid finds him, calls the cops. He's seen us now
LEONARD	Okay. We clean him up, untie him and    march him out with a gun in his back.
TEDDY	Why would I have a gun?
LEONARD	It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.
TEDDY	Fucking hope not.
LEONARD	Which one?
TEDDY	We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
LEONARD	Shut it, Teddy.
TEDDY	Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
LEONARD	I'll ride with him. You follow.
TEDDY	Give me your keys.
LEONARD	Take your own car.
TEDDY	So was he scared?
LEONARD	Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
TEDDY	Fuck you. We shoulda taken his car.
LEONARD	What's wrong with this one?
TEDDY	You like it? Let's trade.
TEDDY	So what are you gonna do now?
LEONARD	I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
TEDDY	Natalie who?
LEONARD	Natalie, right? Who the fuck is Dodd?
LEONARD	What Mrs. Jankis didn't understand was that you can't bully someone into remembering... the more pressure you're under, the harder it gets.     (listens) Then call me back.
LEONARD	Don't feel drunk.
FEMALE VOICE	Housekeeping.
LEONARD	Not just now!
TEDDY	You know what to do.
LEONARD	Ah, it's a message for Teddy...    I'm at the MOUNTCREST INN on 5th Street, Room 6, and I need you to come over as soon as you get this, it's important. This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye.
LEONARD	I'll get the jump on you, fucker.
LEONARD	Is this the guy? Fuck! Sorry.
LEONARD	Need a weapon.
LEONARD	What the fuck am I doing?
LEONARD	Chasing him!
LEONARD	FUCK! He's chasing me.
DODD	I haven't made a strong enough impression.
LEONARD	    (amused) Don't be too hard on yourself.
LEONARD	Seat belt. What the fuck am I doing?
LEONARD	How can you read that again?
LEONARD'S WIFE	    (without looking up) It's good.
LEONARD	You've read it a hundred times.
LEONARD'S WIFE	I enjoy it.
LEONARD	Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
LEONARD'S WIFE	    (looks up, annoyed) Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
LEONARD	Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you.
LEONARD	Do I know this guy?
LEONARD	He seems to know me.
LEONARD	What the fuck!
DODD	I like your car.
LEONARD	Thanks.
DODD	Where'd you get it?
LEONARD	Interested in buying one?
DODD	I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
LEONARD	I forget.
DODD	I haven't made a strong enough impression on you.
LEONARD	    (amused) I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.
LEONARD	Who is this?
LEONARD	    (about to tell her something) Honey?     (relaxed) Honey? It's late.
BLONDE	Was it good for you?
LEONARD	No. That would have been worse. I'd like you to leave now.
LEONARD	Well, sir, that would certainly be in keeping with some of my own discoveries. Yeah, I was hoping to get more on the drugs angle. Hang on a second. The police report mentioned the drugs found in the car outside my house. The car was stolen, but his prints were all over it, along with some of his stuff. And I think there's something...     (flips through pages) Something about a syringe...     (flips pages, confused) I've got a copy of the police report.
LEONARD	None? Okay, blonde. Yeah, blonde is fine. Discount Inn, 304. Leonard.
BLONDE	Well, what then?
LEONARD	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom. No, you just go into the bathroom. We go to bed, you wait till I fall asleep, then you go into the bathroom and slam the door.
BLONDE	Slam it?
LEONARD	Just loud enough to wake me up.
BLONDE	That's it?
LEONARD	That's it. But, first I need you to put these things around. Just pretend these things are yours, and this is your bedroom.
BLONDE	Should I wear it?
LEONARD	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
BLONDE	Whatever gets you off.
LEONARD	No! No, don't use it, you, I mean it's... you just have to put it where you would if it were yours.
LEONARD	The drugs stashed in the car doesn't ring true for me.
TEDDY	You should lock a car as nice as this.
LEONARD	Who the fuck are you?
TEDDY	    (gasping) Teddy. Your buddy.
LEONARD	Prove it.
TEDDY	    (gasping) Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
LEONARD	What are you doing in my car?
TEDDY	Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
LEONARD	Unfinished business.
TEDDY	Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
LEONARD	Who's she?
TEDDY	Whose house do you think you just walked out of? Take a look at your pictures, I bet you got one of her. Great shot, Lenny. You wanna make a note that you can't trust her.
LEONARD	Why's that?
TEDDY	Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake.
LEONARD	What do you mean "bad news"?
TEDDY	She's involved with these drug dealers. See these? That's the bar where she works. Her boyfriend's a drug dealer. She'd take orders for him, arrange meets. He'd write messages on these, then leave it on the bar. She'd drop replies when she served him drinks.
LEONARD	Why should I care?
TEDDY	She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
LEONARD	From who?
TEDDY	Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
LEONARD	Yeah, well maybe she'll make it you. Is that it? You worried she'll use me against you?
TEDDY	She couldn't.
LEONARD	Why not?
TEDDY	    (grins) She has no idea who I am.
LEONARD	Why are you following me?
TEDDY	I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
LEONARD	Happy now?
TEDDY	I won't be happy until you leave town.
LEONARD	Why?
TEDDY	How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
LEONARD	What sort of questions?
TEDDY	The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
LEONARD	Like what?
TEDDY	Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
LEONARD	I have money.
TEDDY	From what?
LEONARD	My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
TEDDY	So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership? You haven't got a clue, have you? You don't even know who you are?
LEONARD	Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
TEDDY	That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. Put it this way. Were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
LEONARD	I didn't sell -
TEDDY	I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
LEONARD	Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
TEDDY	Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town.
LEONARD	 Fuck it. I need my own place.
LEONARD	I can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously. This is a difficult condition for people to understand. I mean look at Sammy Jankis. His own wife couldn't deal with it.
LEONARD	She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back.
MRS. JANKIS	Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
LEONARD	Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
MRS. JANKIS	I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
LEONARD	We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
MRS. JANKIS	I'm not appealing the decision.
LEONARD	Then why are you here?
MRS. JANKIS	Mr. Shelby, try and understand. When I look into Sammy's eyes, I don't see some vegetable, I see the same old Sammy. What do you think it's like for me to suspect that he's imagining this whole  problem? That if I could just say the right thing he'd snap out of it and be back to normal? If I knew that my old Sammy was truly gone, then I could say goodbye and start loving this new Sammy.     As long as I have doubt, I can't say goodbye and move on.
LEONARD	Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
MRS. JANKIS	I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition. I need to know what you honestly believe.
LEONARD	    (looks at Mrs. Jankis) I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
MRS. JANKIS	Thank you.
LEONARD	She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
LEONARD	What happened?
NATALIE	What does it look like?! He beat the shit out of me.
LEONARD	Who?
LEONARD	Why?
NATALIE	Because of you, you fucking idiot! Because I did what you told me!
LEONARD	Calm down.     (softly) Take it easy. You're safe now. You're safe. Let's get some ice on your face.
NATALIE	I did exactly what you told me. I went to    Dodd and I said that I didn't have Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
LEONARD	And what did he say?
NATALIE	He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
LEONARD	Where is he?
NATALIE	What are you gonna do?
LEONARD	I'll go see him.
NATALIE	And?
LEONARD	Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
NATALIE	He'll kill you, Lenny.
LEONARD	    (smiling) My wife used to call me Lenny.
NATALIE	Yeah?
LEONARD	Yeah, I hated it.
NATALIE	This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
LEONARD	I'll take care of it. Just tell me what he looks like, and where I can find him. Do you have a pen?
NATALIE	He'll probably find you.
LEONARD	Me? Why would he be interested in me?
NATALIE	I told him about your car.
LEONARD	Why would you do that?
NATALIE	He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
LEONARD	Just write it all down. What he looks   like, where I find him.
TEDDY	You should lock a car as nice as this.
LEONARD	No, she shouldn't have given me that responsibility. Shit, I'm not a doctor, I'm a claims investigator. I suppose, but I've got all sorts of other considerations. Legal responsibility, and large financial...
LEONARD	What's wrong?
NATALIE	Somebody's come. Already.
LEONARD	Who?
NATALIE	Calls himself Dodd.
LEONARD	What does he want?
NATALIE	Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
LEONARD	Did you?
NATALIE	No!
LEONARD	What's this all about?
NATALIE	You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
LEONARD	I have this condition -
NATALIE	I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
LEONARD	What happened?
NATALIE	What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
LEONARD	Neither do I.
NATALIE	Don't protect him.
LEONARD	I'm not.
NATALIE	Help me.
LEONARD	How?
NATALIE	Get rid of Dodd for me.
LEONARD	What?
NATALIE	Kill him. I'll pay you.
LEONARD	What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
NATALIE	What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
LEONARD	That's different.
NATALIE	Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
LEONARD	Don't talk about my wife.
NATALIE	I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
LEONARD	Calm down.
NATALIE	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
LEONARD	Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
NATALIE	Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
LEONARD	Yes.
NATALIE	You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
LEONARD	Shut the fuck up!
NATALIE	I'm gonna use you, you stupid fuck. I'm telling you now because I'll enjoy it more if I know that you could stop me if you weren't a freak.
LEONARD	Don't say another fucking word!
NATALIE	About your whore of a wife? I read about your problem. You know what one of the causes of short term memory loss is? Venereal disease. Maybe your cunt of a wife sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard. You sad freak, you won't remember any of what I've said, and we'll be best friends, or even lovers.
LEONARD	What happened?
NATALIE	What does it look like?
LEONARD	Front desk? Burt, right. Well, this is Mr. Shelby in Room 21. I don't want any calls, none at all, got it? Thanks.
NATALIE	You can just crash out on the couch. You'll be comfortable. Uh, take a seat. So how long you think it's gonna take you? You told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife.
LEONARD	    (consulting file)    Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -
 NATALIE	Can I ask you something? If you've got all this information, how come the police haven't found him for you?
 LEONARD	They're not looking for him.
 NATALIE	Why not?
LEONARD	They don't think he exists. I told them what I remembered. I was asleep, something woke me up...
LEONARD	Her side of the bed was cold. She'd been     out of bed for a while.
NATALIE	How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
LEONARD	    (points at conclusions on back John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.
NATALIE	You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
LEONARD	Thank you.
NATALIE	I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
LEONARD	Oh, one thing. Something to remember you by.
NATALIE	Somebody's come. Already.
BURT	Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
LEONARD	Yeah?
BURT	I know you said you didn't want any calls...
LEONARD	That's right I did, didn't I?
BURT	Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
LEONARD	A cop?
BURT	And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.
LEONARD	    (shakes head)   I'm not too good on the phone. I need to     look people in the eye when I talk to   them.
NATALIE	On the house.
LEONARD	Thanks.
NATALIE	    (fascinated) You really do have a problem. Just like that cop said.
LEONARD	    (shrugs) Nobody's perfect.
NATALIE	What's the last thing you remember? Leonard looks at her.
LEONARD	My wife.
NATALIE	Sweet.
LEONARD	Dying.
NATALIE	What?
LEONARD	I remember my wife dying.
NATALIE	Let me get you a fresh glass. I think this one was dusty.
LEONARD	Beer, please.
NATALIE	    (apprehensive) What do you want?
 LEONARD	A BEER, please.
 NATALIE	Don't just waltz in here dressed like   that and order a beer.
 LEONARD	There's a dress code?
 NATALIE	What are you here for?
 LEONARD	I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
 NATALIE	Well, that's me.
 LEONARD	Oh. But haven't we met before? So why am I here?
 NATALIE	You tell me.
 LEONARD	I don't remember. See, I have no short- term memory. It's not amnesia -
NATALIE	You're the memory guy?
LEONARD	How do you know about me?
NATALIE	My boyfriend told me about you.
LEONARD	Who's your boyfriend?
NATALIE	    (beat) Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He told me about you. Said you were staying over at the Discount. Then, just this   evening, this cop comes in here looking for you. Looking for a guy who couldn't remember stuff, who'd forget how he got here or where he was going. I told him we get a lot of guys like that in here.
LEONARD	Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
NATALIE	Are you Teddy?
LEONARD	My name's Leonard.
NATALIE	Did Teddy send you?
LEONARD	I don't know.
NATALIE	What's happened to Jimmy?
LEONARD	I don't know. I'm sorry.
NATALIE	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
LEONARD	I can't make new memories. Everything   fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
NATALIE	So why did you come here?
LEONARD	Found it in my pocket.
NATALIE	    (quiet) Your pocket.
LEONARD	Thank-you.
LEONARD	    (anxious)  What do you want?       (listens)  I know you're a cop, but what do you    want? Did I do something wrong?        (frightened)    No, but I can't remember things I do. I don't know what I just did. Maybe I did something wrong, did I do something     wrong?
LEONARD	I dunno - something bad. Maybe I did    something bad.
NATALIE	    (casual)   Hey, Jimmy -   I'm sorry, I... I thought you were someone else.
LEONARD	No, Officer, but with my condition, you don't know anything... you feel angry,  guilty, you don't know why. You could do     something terrible and not have the     faintest idea ten minutes later. Like   Sammy. What if I've done something like Sammy?!       (listens)  I didn't tell you? Didn't I tell you    what happened to Sammy and his wife?!       (listens)
LEONARD	I never said he was faking. Just that his condition was mental, not physical. She seemed satisfied, she just said "thanks" and got up to leave. I found out later that she went home and gave Sammy his final exam.
MRS. JANKIS	Sammy, it's time for my shot.
LEONARD	She knew beyond doubt that he loved her, so she found a way to test him.
MRS. JANKIS	Sammy, it's time for my shot. Sammy, it's time for my shot.
LEONARD	She really thought she would call his bluff... ... or didn't want to live with the things she'd put him through.
LEONARD	She went into a coma and never recovered. Sammy couldn't understand or explain what had happened.
LEONARD	He's been in a home ever since. He doesn't even know his wife is dead.
LEONARD	Didn't know this town had a parlor.
TATTOOIST	Every town's got a parlor.
LEONARD	I'd like this on my thigh please.
LEONARD	Promise you won't call me an idiot.
TATTOOIST	    (shaking her head) Idiot.
TEDDY	Hi, Lenny.
TATTOOIST	It's private back here.
TEDDY	It's alright, we know each other, right, Lenny?
LEONARD	How'd you know I was in here?
TEDDY	The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back. You should have just left town, Lenny. There's Tattoo parlors up North.
LEONARD	Guess I wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind.
TEDDY	Gimme the keys, I'll move the car.
LEONARD	It'll be alright for a minute.
TATTOOIST	Wait out there.
TEDDY	Lenny, I'll be back in a minute. I've got to get you some stuff.
TEDDY	Give us a minute, will ya? We've got to get you out of here.
LEONARD	Why?
TEDDY	Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
LEONARD	Why not?
TEDDY	Because that cop's looking for you. We  need to get you a change of identity. Some new clothes and a different car should do for now. Put these on.
LEONARD	What cop?
TEDDY	This bad cop. He checked you into the   Discount Inn. Then he's been calling you     for days, sticking envelopes under your door, telling you shit.
LEONARD	Envelopes?
TEDDY	He knows you're no good on the phone, so     he calls you up to bullshit you.   Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so he slips something under your door to   frighten you into answering your phone  again. He's been pretending to help you.     Feeding you a line of crap about John G.     being some local drug dealer.
LEONARD	How do you know this?
TEDDY	'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
LEONARD	How do you know him?
TEDDY	    (glances around) I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
LEONARD	What did he want to know from you?
TEDDY  	He wanted to know all, about Jimmy Grantz.
LEONARD	Who?
TEDDY	Jimmy's a drug dealer. This cop wanted to know all about how he sets up deals, shit like that. He's got some score in mind  and you're involved. Come on, there's no     time to argue - if he knew I was helping      you he'd find a way to kill me. Just get     these clothes on. You're gonna take my  car and get the fuck out of here.
LEONARD	    (under his breath) Sneaky fuck. "Bad Cop". Had me going.
LEONARD	So this Jimmy Grantz deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works. But he'll come to the meet alone.
TEDDY	Lenny!
LEONARD	Officer Gammell.
LEONARD	Something to remember you by. I'm sorry - is it Officer, or Lieutenant Gammell?
TEDDY	Just Teddy. Don't write Gammell please. I'm undercover. Here's directions. He'll be heading there now.
LEONARD	You're not coming?
TEDDY	Wouldn't be appropriate. Leonard? Make him beg.
JIMMY	Teddy?!
LEONARD	Jimmy?
JIMMY	What the fuck are you doing here?
LEONARD	Do you remember me?
JIMMY	    (laughs) Yeah, I remember you.
LEONARD	You Jimmy Grantz?
JIMMY	Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy? Well?
LEONARD	Strip!
JIMMY	You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
LEONARD	Don't say anything else.
JIMMY	I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
LEONARD	Quiet! Pants, too.
JIMMY	Why?
LEONARD	I don't want blood on them.
JIMMY	    (sudden fear) Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
LEONARD	Strip!
JIMMY	Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
LEONARD	You think you can bargain with me?!
JIMMY	Take the money and walk away!
LEONARD	I don't want your fucking money!
JIMMY	What?! What do you want from me?!
LEONARD	I want my fucking life back!
JIMMY	    (barely and audible rasp) Sammy... remember Sammy...
LEONARD	What have I done?
LEONARD	    (distraught) Hey! Mister! I need help!
TEDDY	What's wrong?
LEONARD	There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
LEONARD	    (panicked) He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
TEDDY	No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
LEONARD	Maybe. Maybe just.
TEDDY	So what were you doing here?
LEONARD	I don't know. See, I have this condition.
TEDDY	Well, I hope it's not as serious as his, 'cos this guy's dead. FUCK, Lenny! That fucking kills!
LEONARD	Remember me again, huh? You're a cop. A fucking cop.
TEDDY  	Yeah, and I helped you find the guy you were looking for -
LEONARD	Get up.
TEDDY	I think you've got the wrong idea -
LEONARD	Who was that? He's not the guy. He knew me.
TEDDY  	Sure he did. He raped your wife and     fucked up your brain.
LEONARD	Bullshit.
TEDDY	His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check    your tattoos.
LEONARD	So what was he bringing the two hundred grand for?
TEDDY  	What -
LEONARD	What was it for?
TEDDY	A load of amphetamine I told him I had.
LEONARD	This is a drug deal?!
TEDDY	That, and your thing.
LEONARD	But how did he know me?
TEDDY  	The Discount Inn, he deals out of there.     The guy at the front desk lets him know if anybody comes snooping around. He called Jimmy as soon as you took a picture of that dump.
LEONARD	You're using me!
TEDDY	No!     (beat) You get half.
LEONARD	He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?
TEDDY	    (chuckles) You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
LEONARD	What the fuck are you talking about?
TEDDY	    (theatrical shrug) I dunno... your wife surviving the assault... her not believing about your condition... the doubt tearing her up inside.., the insulin -
LEONARD	I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
TEDDY	Sammy didn't have a wife. It was your wife who had diabetes.
LEONARD'S WIFE	Gentle.
LEONARD	My wife wasn't diabetic.
TEDDY	Are you sure?
LEONARD'S WIFE	Gentle.
LEONARD	She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't  know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong     with you?
TEDDY	    (shrugs) I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'    Jimmy down there.
LEONARD	But he's not the right guy!
TEDDY  	He was to you. Come on, Lenny, you got  your revenge - just enjoy it while you  still remember.
TEDDY	    (chuckles) What difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
LEONARD	It makes all the difference.
TEDDY	Why? You're never going to know.
LEONARD	Yes, I will.
TEDDY	No, you won't.
LEONARD	Somehow, I'll know!
TEDDY	You won't remember!
LEONARD	When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
TEDDY	I thought so too! I was sure you'd remember. But you didn't.
TEDDY	    (off look) You know, when we found your guy and    killed him.     (off look) That's right, the real John G. Over a   year ago. I helped you find him. He's   already dead.
LEONARD	Why do you keep lying to me?
TEDDY	I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your wife's death. I believed you, I thought you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.     We found him and you killed him.
LEONARD	So who are you saying he was?
TEDDY	Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too  strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him, I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick. That's the picture, right? I took that, right when you did it. Look how happy you    are. Before you forgot. I wanted to see that face again.
LEONARD	    (sarcastic)     Thank you.
TEDDY	Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and    you were more than happy to help. You lie    to yourself! You don't want the truth,  the truth is a fucking coward. So you   make up your own truth.
LEONARD	You probably.
TEDDY	No. You took them out.
LEONARD	Why would I do that?
TEDDY	To set yourself a puzzle you won't ever solve. You know how many towns, how many     guys called James G? Or John G? Shit, Leonard, I'm a John G.
LEONARD	Your name's Teddy.
TEDDY	    (chuckles) My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John     G's for us to find. All you do is moan. I'm the one that has to live with what  you've done. I'm the one that has to put     it all together. You just wander around playing detective. You're living a dream,    kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense     of purpose to your life. A romantic quest    which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't in the picture.
LEONARD	I should kill you.
TEDDY	Quit it!      (brushes the gun away)    You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why  you're so good at it.
LEONARD	I'm not a killer...
LEONARD (CON'T'D)	... but right now I need to be.
TEDDY	Hey! Hey, that's not your car!
LEONARD	It is now.
TEDDY	You can't just take it!
LEONARD	Why not?
TEDDY	You just killed the guy who owned it! Somebody'll recognize it!
LEONARD	I'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a murderer. I'm gonna hang on to this.
LEONARD	I have to believe in the world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there.     (rising tension) But do I? Do I believe the world's still there?
