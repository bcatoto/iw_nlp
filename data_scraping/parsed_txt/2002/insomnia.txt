Insomnia

HAP	PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle Times. Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.
WILL	Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit. Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.
HAP Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just below the surface.  He taps the file.
WILL
PILOT	The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red baron hat. Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of them.  Looks at Will.
OLD MAN	ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN hosing down the side of the building.
ELLIE
MR. ANGSTROM	Ellie puffs up.
ELLIE
MR. ANGSTROM	The old man screws up his face, confused.
ELLIE	A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it.
MR. ANGSTROM	Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and... WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses. Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging sign.
WILL	Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck.
HAP
ELLIE	They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then his hand.  Shakes it vigorously. Will motions to Hap.
WILL
ELLIE	She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase.
ELLIE	Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside. The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder.
PILOT
ELLIE	She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar. Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe. Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.
WILL
ELLIE	She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot.
ELLIE
CHIEF NYBACK
CHIEF NYBACK	Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap on the back.
WILL	Nyback shakes Hap's hand.  A reunion.
HAP
CHIEF NYBACK
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK
HAP
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Looks at Will.  Down at his boots. Will.  Looks at Nyback's gut.
WILL	They LAUGH.  Eyes twinkling.
CHIEF NYBACK	He starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still standing by the door.  Points to Will. Ellie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will.
ELLIE
CHIEF NYBACK	Ellie, realises they want to be alone.
ELLIE	Backs out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat.
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.
WILL	Hap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base.
HAP
CHIEF NYBACK	Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  "Deeper Investigation into Special Branch"... Will and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over the paper.
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK
WILL	Nyback winces.
CHIEF NYBACK
HAP
WILL
HAP	Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.
CHIEF NYBACK	Hap tosses a glance over at Will.
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the trash. A cloud passes over his face. Holds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL.
CHIEF NYBACK	They turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up: MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it. Nyback opens the door onto...
CHIEF NYBACK	The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk.
FRED
CHIEF NYBACK	Will puts out his hand.
WILL	Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands.
FRED
FRED	He heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a glance.
WILL
ELLIE	They turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the hunched figure to Fred. Fred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed.
FRED
CORONER	PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back. The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late seventies.
HAP
CORONER	Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and breasts.
WILL
CORONER
WILL
CORONER	The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet. Will stays her hand.
WILL	He pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips. He bends down to smell her hair. Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers. Continues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands. Examines her fingers, her nails. Continues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and second toes.
FRED
WILL
FRED	Will stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young. Beautiful.  Skin like marble.
WILL
HAP	Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.
RACHEL	They turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and intelligent eyes.
HAP
RACHEL
HAP
RACHEL	Hap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch.
WILL	Rachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk.
RACHEL
WILL	He glances out the window.  It's as bright as day.
RACHEL	She hands them two cards.
HAP	Will SLAPS the magazine back.
WILL	Hap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.
HAP	He walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor. Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT in the harbor towing a freighter. Will reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt.
WILL
HAP	Will throws him a look.
WILL

HAP
WILL	Will goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of sweat on his upper lip.
HAP	Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner.
WILL
HAP
WILL
HAP
WILL
HAP
WILL	He grabs a hanger.
HAP	He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow.
HAP	Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.
WILL	The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door.
WILL
ELLIE
ELLIE	Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes.
WILL	He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window. Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!
ELLIE	She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn. They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking stick.  Ellie calls out the window. JOE waves.  They pass. Will looks over at her.  Smiles.
WILL
ELLIE
WILL	He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently. Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...
ELLIE	Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her.
MRS. CONNELL
MRS. CONNELL	Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go.
WILL
ELLIE	Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots beneath the panties.
WILL	On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up. Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing.
FRED
WILL
FRED	Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner.
WILL
FRED	Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant. The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another. Feels the fabric.
WILL	Fred and Ellie exchange a look.
ELLIE	Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.
WILL
HAP	Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table. Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up.
WILL	He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room.
WILL	The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to grow a moustache.
RANDY	He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap sits opposite.
HAP	Randy throws him a look.
RANDY
HAP	Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup.
WILL
RANDY
WILL	Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs.
RANDY	Will turns with his coffee.
WILL
RANDY
WILL
RANDY
WILL	Randy glares.
RANDY

RANDY
WILL
RANDY
WILL
RANDY	Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the collar.  Nose to nose.
WILL	Randy's lip curls.  Red-faced.
RANDY
WILL
RANDY	Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.
ELLIE	Will smooths back his hair.  Checks his tie.
WILL	He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace from Kay's room.  Hands it to her.
WILL
ELLIE
WILL
ELLIE	Will stops.  Ellie stops.  Will puts a hand on her shoulder.
WILL	Ellie smiles, teasing.
ELLIE	Will, has to smile.  She's quick.  Looks down the hall.  A bearded GUY on crutches.  Ellie follows his gaze.
WILL
ELLIE
WILL	Will heads over to him.  Ellie watches his neck.  Her hand closing over the necklace.
WILL	He puts down his menu.  Reaches for his drink.
HAP	Will drains his drink.  Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the bar.  Beer froth on his moustache.
WILL
HAP	Will looks back at his partner.  Hap's fidgeting with the end of his tie. A cold flash down Will's spine.
HAP
WILL	Hap avoids his eyes.
HAP
WILL
HAP
WILL
RACHEL	The men look up, interrupted.  Rachel is standing by the table with a pad.  Hap tries to recover with a big smile.
HAP
RACHEL	Will stands abruptly.  Eyes on Hap.  Trying not to explode.
WILL	Just then, his cell phone RINGS.
WILL	Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk.
ELLIE	Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys, FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt into his dirty jeans. They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it.
WILL
FRED
HAP	Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into the bag.  Pulls out two text books.
WILL	He shoves the books towards one of the guys. He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents. Looks up at Fred. Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie. Next, a couple worn paperbacks. He looks up at the group. Farrell straightens.
FARRELL	Will tosses them to him.
WILL	Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie. Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers. Fred reaches for the knapsack.
FRED
WILL	Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking. Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the
FARRELL
ELLIE	Fred tightens his jaw.
FRED	Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them.
WILL
ELLIE
WILL	He hands the bag to Farrell. Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands. Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred.
HAP	WILL lowers his binoculars.  He's standing on the black rocky beach.  It's damp, slick, and cold.  A fog's rolling in. Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  A couple paper bags and a megaphone.  They're comparing guns.
FARRELL	Hap reaches into his holster.  Pulls out a...
HAP
FARRELL	Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.  He's got a pair of binoculars, too.  They're staking out the cabin. Been there a while.
ELLIE	Ellie appears with a thermos.  Crouching down.  Fred turns, annoyed.
FRED
WILL	Fred shoots Will a look.  Down at his cowboy boots.  Will gives him a smile.
ELLIE
WILL  FRED	Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.
FARRELL
HAP	Hap and Farrell chuckle.  Hap unscrews the thermos.  A cloud of steam. Will looks down at his partner.  Holding out the thermos like a weird kind of truce.  Will turns away, rejecting it.  A swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as... Fred tenses.
FRED	Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.  Will whips up his binoculars. POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to  the cabin.  Furtive.
WILL	Will lowers the binoculars.  Snaps his fingers at the men.
ELLIE	Will puts up his hand.  She stops short.  He plunges ahead. Hap.  Will.  Farrell.  Fred.  Fanning out.  Silent.  Keeping eye-contact.  Will points to Farrell.  Wants the megaphone. Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  Accidentally keys it.  The feedback SQUAWKS.  Fuck.
FRED	POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around, running towards the cabin.  Leaping from rock to rock. WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.
WILL	The men jump into action.  Race down towards the cabin. Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  Will and Hap, harder going.  Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small crevices.  Rocks sticking out every which way.  The fog, thick and white... THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin. FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down. Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready... WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.  Joins Fred and Farrell at the door. Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod to Fred as he KICKS it in...
     WILL	They look around:  Nothing.  A few old nets, a wooden table rotted through.  No knapsack. In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open.  Will races over. Looks down into the darkness. Turns and points to Farrell. The men nod. They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches down by the trap door and...
FARRELL
WILL	Farrell can't answer that. Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water.
FARRELL	Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind. Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few  seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood  pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a plateau of rocks when...
WILL	CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it. Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure, disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...
VOICE	Fred emerges from the fog. CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie freeze.
VOICE	The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see...
WILL	Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched. Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white... Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound... trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the water... Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body. Feels for Hap's pulse.
FRED	Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder. Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts. Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it savagely into the thick fog.
CHIEF NYBACK	Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space.
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Will, hesitates.
WILL	He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows. Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.
CHIEF NYBACK	He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head. Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair. Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk. Everything CRASHES to the floor.
WILL	Nyback looks up at him.  Calm.
CHIEF NYBACK	Will clenches his fists.
WILL	Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend.
CHIEF NYBACK
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that belies that a man has recently died.
ELLIE	Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over.
CHIEF NYBACK	Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's back. Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice.
ELLIE	Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.
CHIEF NYBACK	Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.
WILL	Nyback catches his arm.
CHIEF NYBACK	Will looks at him.  Know's he's right.
RADIO	It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway. Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.
RACHEL	Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk. She reaches for his key. Will takes his key.
WILL	He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS.
RACHEL	Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the mouthpiece. Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the  world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face. Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone. Clears his throat.
WILL	PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end.
WARFIELD'S VOICE	Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not to listen.
WILL
WILL
WARFIELD'S VOICE	Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist. Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady.
WILL	SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his hair.  Turns back to Rachel.
WILL	He gets tangled in it. Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.
HAP	Will whirls around...
WILL	...nothing.  No one's there.
CHIEF NYBACK
CHIEF NYBACK	Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred. Fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will. Will looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his head.
CHIEF NYBACK	Feet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up. A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat.
ELLIE	He turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map. She holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of coastline.  Red circles marking various points. Will looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around.
WILL	He looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face.
ELLIE	Will points to a spot.  Cutting her off.
WILL	Hands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up.
FRED
WILL	He pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches him leave.  Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.
FRED
ELLIE
FARRELL
WILL	He pulls up a chair.  Nods to the paperback. Farrell bites into the candy bar.
FARRELL	He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows uncomfortably.
WILL
FARRELL
WILL
FARRELL
WILL
FARRELL
WILL	Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember.
FARRELL	Will sighs, rubs his eyes.
WILL	Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty, freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell.
NURSE	Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.
FARRELL	Lonnie gives him the cup.
LONNIE
WILL
FARRELL
WILL
FARRELL	Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his mouth.
ELLIE	Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks, wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big. A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to him. She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two evenings before.  Finds... ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking. He looks up.  Pimples on his chin.
FRANCIS
ELLIE
FRANCIS
ELLIE	Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot.
FRANCIS	CLICK!  Kepp takes the picture.
ELLIE	She stops.  Looks at the map.  At the spot Will pointed out. A VOICE calls back.  Someone pretending to be Hap.
VOICE	Ellie furrows her brow.  Just then... FRANCIS appears.  Slips on a rock but catches his fall.
FRANCIS
WILL	PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out across the road about a mile up the beach.  Some old, some young.  Linking arms and moving forward.  Looking down.  The
VOICE	Will turns.  A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.
BURLY GUY #1	Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.
WILL	Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.  He hands the guys two radios.
FRED	Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.  Young and apple-cheeked.  The first one holding a piece of paper.
OFFICER #1
WILL
OFFICER #1	Hands the list to Will.  He glances it.
WILL	The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.  Fred saunters over.  Nods towards the searchers.
FRED	Will shakes his head.
WILL	Fred shrugs, skeptical.  Just then, his cell phone BLEATS. He reaches for it.
FRED	Will looks back at the search team.  Slow.  Meticulous. A local WOMAN.  At the end of the line.  Glances over her shoulder.  Looks at Will.  Smiles.  You'll help us catch him. Will turns back to him. Fred crosses his arms.  Sarcastic.
RACHEL	Will takes it.  Preoccupied.
WILL	He starts up the stairs.  Notices Rachel straining to return the key to the top of the clock.  Backtracks to help her. She gets it without his help.
RACHEL
WILL	Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers something. A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her.
WILL
RACHEL
WILL
RACHEL
WILL	Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock.
RACHEL	Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates.
WILL
WILL
ELLIE
WILL
ELLIE	She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble.
ELLIE	Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.
WILL
ELLIE	Libby takes another swing.  Connects with the ball.  Drops the bat and runs to first.  Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.
WILL	Ellie, sits up...
ELLIE
WILL
ELLIE	Will leans back.  Stretching his legs.  Remembering.
WILL	Suddenly, he stops talking.  Slowly sits up.  Sensing  something.  Ellie, noticing the shift.
ELLIE	The row of DADS behind them.  Jump up and start CHEERING.
WILL
ELLIE	He turns to go, scanning the area.  Ellie calls after him.
WILL	Francis turns.
WILL
WILL	Stops at an open doorway in time to see
CORONER	Will clears his throat.  Closes his cell phone.
WILL	The coroner nods.  Goes to wash her hands.
CORONER	Shrugs off her lab coat.  She's wearing a blue dress.  Looks like a piano teacher.  Heads into an adjoining office. Will.  Alone.  Steps into the room.  The smell of formaldehyde.  Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray. Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape under the sheet when... SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.  Thick fingers.  Wedding band. Will jumps...
CORONER	The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila envelope.  Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen. Will rubs his face.  Tries to focus on the clipboard.  The coroner holds out the envelope.  Smiles.
WILL	He takes the envelope.  The coroner peers up at him.
CORONER
WILL	He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila envelope.
WILL	Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker.
FRED	INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on this one: Farrell Brooks. Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow.
WILL	Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door.
FRED
WILL	Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.
FRED	Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand. Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway.
SECRETARY
SECRETARY	Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes.
WILL	Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything. Will, too tired for this shit... Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's. This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed.
MAN'S VOICE	Will straightens.  Something weird.
WILL	A little TITTER on the other end.
MAN'S VOICE
WILL	A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie.
WILL	The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER.
MAN'S VOICE	Will, furrows his brow.
MAN'S VOICE
WILL
MAN'S VOICE	CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles. CLICK.  The line goes dead. Will, throat constricted.  Listening to the DIAL TONE. Smiles back at Nyback.  Turns.  Slowly hangs up the phone. White as a sheet.  Trying to act normal.  Trying to act calm. SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different. Looks over at
ELLIE	He closes his eyes.  Now is not the time.  Reaches the Cherokee.  Yanks open the driver's side door.  Ellie catches up with him.  Out of breath.
ELLIE	She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.  They're of the BEACH. The ones Kepp took.  Almost all fog. Will.  Barely glancing at them.  Tosses the box into the car.
WILL	Gets in and closes the door.  Puts his hand over the box. Ellie comes up to the window.
ELLIE
WILL
ELLIE
WILL
ELLIE	Will, about to seriously lose his shit.  Looks at Ellie. Eyes dark, distant.
WILL	He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than stung.
FRED	Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred  Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then Farrell's.  Angry.
WILL	SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich exchange a glance.
YOUNG GIRL	PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside.
YOUNG GIRL	The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm. Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets. Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out.
VOICE	Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him. Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his head.  Looks back up at THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's casket. AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with a pink ribbon... Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something catches his eye.
FRED	He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will.
WILL	Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the  cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle.
WILL	They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face.
RANDY
WILL	Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket.
TANYA
RANDY	Randy kick starts the bike.  It dies.  He kicks it again. Calls out over his shoulder.
RANDY
TANYA
WILL
TANYA	Will, shifts.  Looks over.
WILL	Tanya hesitates.  Pulls a cigarette from her purse.
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL	Tanya shrugs.  Lights the cigarette.  Takes a drag.
TANYA	She stretches.  Her midriff showing.  Shifts her body towards Will.
WILL	Tanya makes a face.  Reaches out and taps the hula-girl.
TANYA	Will looks over at her.  She blows out a plume of smoke. Smiles.  Seductive.
WILL
TANYA	She reaches out a sinewy arm.  Starts massaging the back of Will's neck. Will, impervious to the touch.  Head, throbbing.  Reaches for the gear.  His foot, pressing harder on the gas.
WILL	The truck BEEPS.  Will goes faster.  Tanya takes her hand from Will's neck.  Holds on to her seat.
TANYA
WILL	Will goes even faster...
TANYA	Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK... bearing down on them... Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away... The TRUCK...a breath away...
TANYA	Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car. Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates. Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles. Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone.
WILL
TANYA
WILL	Tanya steps back. He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will leans in. Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting, rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She tries to break away...
TANYA
WILL	Tanya looks away. She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice.
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL	Tanya, squirming.  Angry.
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL
TANYA
WILL
TANYA	Will straightens.  He's heard that name before. Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out. She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground.
WILL	The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats. Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat." Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of  a killer.  Looks into the
WALTER'S VOICE	Will freezes. Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously... Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the tape cuts off.
WILL	Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.
FRED
WILL
FRED	Holds out a one-page report. Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine.
WILL
FRED	He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback. Will blinks.
WILL
FRED	Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...
WILL
FRED
WILL
FRED	CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at the report.  Judicious.
WILL	The CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's staring right at him - that isn't like him. He turns back to Fred.  Beat. The CLACKING resumes.
WOMAN'S VOICE	More FEET running over.
MAN'S VOICE	Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus. Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him, wearing overalls.  Reaches out.
OLD LADY	Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge.
OLD LADY
WILL
OLD LADY	Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.
WILL	Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed- nose voice.
WALTER	The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing. Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes. Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From beating Kay Connell to death. He points to his hearing-aid. The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles.
WALTER	He points off to the horizon. Will's lip curls.  Watching him. SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely keeping control.
WILL	Walter flounders. His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced, sputtering...
WALTER	Will clenches his teeth.
WILL	Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball fight. Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges   his hearing aid. Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain.
WALTER	Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts it back around his ear. Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something in his pocket.
WILL	Walter turns back to him.
WALTER
WILL	Walter shrugs.
WALTER	Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to throttle this weed.
WILL	Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head.
WALTER	He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose. Will stares at him. Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart pounding.  Turns to watch... THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their GIGGLES carried along by the wind. Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every instinct in his body.
WILL	Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL	Walter smiles.  Pleased.
WALTER
WILL	Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking.
WALTER	JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter looks down at it. He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head. Snaps his fingers.  An idea. Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands.
WILL	TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry.
WALTER	Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to Walter.
WILL	Walter looks back.  Waves.
WALTER	Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again. Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning up water.  Starting forward just as... Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds it up for Will to see. Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his  body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists towards the ramp but... A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker, grabs his arm.
TICKET TAKER	Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance.
WILL
ELLIE	A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar. Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road.
WILL	Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.  They start walking.
ELLIE	She pulls a folder from her bag. Will takes the file.  Flips it open.  The death of his partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen.
WILL	He signs.  Hands it back to her.  She slips it into her bag. A slight stutter in Will's step.
WILL
ELLIE	Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right leg.  The cut on his forehead. They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.
WILL
ELLIE	Will, finally looks at her.
WILL	Turns and starts up the steps. Ellie, watches him for a second.  Then calls out.
ELLIE	Will stops, turns to look back at her.  Confused. Slings the bag over her shoulder.
WILL	Interrupted by a CLICK...
RECORDED VOICE	Walter Byrd's voice.  Recorded from that afternoon. Will, hears his own voice...
WILL	Then, another clumsy CLICK.  Walter Byrd gets on.
WALTER	He hangs up. Will SLAMS down the receiver.  Then again.  And again.  Yanks the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.
WILL	His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks across the room and sees
HAP	He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as... The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor.   LIGHT floods the room.
WILL
RACHEL
RACHEL
WILL
RACHEL	Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into...
RACHEL	Will grabs up a sweater.
WILL	He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the stuff piled up.  Softens her voice.
RACHEL	Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack.
WILL	Rachel walks up behind him.  His cramming, more desperate. More urgent.
RACHEL	He grabs a magazine.
WILL	Rachel reaches out.  Catches his arm.
RACHEL	He stops.  Looks down at her hand. Will suddenly realises what he's doing.  Absurd.  Pathetic.  Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel. Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop. Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms. Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck. Wants to be swallowed up. Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in. Sweet, soft, safe. Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry, urgent.  His arms move to surround her.
WILL	Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror. Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it.
RACHEL
WILL	He pauses.
RACHEL	Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening.
WILL	Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising the weight of the confession.
RACHEL
WILL	He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs. Rests his arms on his knees.
RACHEL
WILL	Rachel rubs his shoulder.
RACHEL	Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic.
WILL	There's a PAUSE.  Rachel, studying Will's back.  The cuts. The bruises.  Not sure how to answer.
RACHEL	Looks out the window.
FRED
WALTER
FRED	Walter smiles modestly.  Looks over at Ellie.
WALTER
ELLIE	Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth.
WALTER	Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds it up.  Opened to the signature.
FRED
WALTER
FRED
WALTER
FRED
WALTER	Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts.
WILL	Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed.
WALTER	Will turns.  Accusatory.
WILL	Walter blinks.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL	Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his pockets.
WILL
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	He turns to Fred and Ellie. Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough.
FRED	Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back over to the window.
WALTER
FRED
WALTER	Fred, sits up.
FRED
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee.
FRED	Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid.
WALTER	Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too busy watching this little man weave his web.
FRED
WALTER
ELLIE
FRED	Walter looks right at her.
WALTER	Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door.
FRED	Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out to Ellie.  Smiles.
WALTER	Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine. Fred turns back to the door... AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will. Mouths the words Wild Card. A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy.
RANDY	Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The CLATTER of tools.
RANDY	Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side. Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by...
OFFICER	Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike. Someone's pulled the gun from the can.
RANDY	Fred's voice, calm.
FRED	More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate.
RANDY	Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic.
FRED
RANDY	More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES. Will looks down at the floor as FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams. Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.
FRED	Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost kid.  Tears streaming down his face.
RANDY
FRED	Will shifts his eyes to him.
WILL	Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car.
FRED	Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on. Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him. Takes it.
FARRELL	PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall. Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN. Rich takes a glass from Fred.
RICH
FRANCIS
FARRELL	Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell.
FRED	Farrell shifts in his seat.
FARRELL	Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer.
FRANCIS
RICH	He and Francis GUFFAW.
FRED	Farrell looks over at Will.
FARRELL	Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke.
WILL	Fred pats Will's shoulder.
FRED
RICH
WILL	Francis grabs a handful of peanuts.
FRANCIS
RICH
FRANCIS
FARRELL	Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache.
FRED
RICH
FRED
ELLIE	They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down vest.  Hair tousled.
FRED
FRANCIS
ELLIE
RICH
FARRELL
ELLIE	Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie.
FRED	Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with the SHELL CASING inside.
ELLIE
FARRELL
ELLIE	Will, blanches.
FRANCIS
ELLIE	Rich throws peanut shells at her.
RICH	Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will.
ELLIE	Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods.
WILL
ELLIE	He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the side of the table.
WILL	The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar. Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke. MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound. Like being swallowed up in a black hole... Looks back at the table.
ELLIE	We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble, big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.
ELLIE'S DAD	Ellie appears at the top of the stairs.
ELLIE
WALTER	Will enters the monument.
WILL	A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.
WALTER	Will's eyes pierce into him.
WILL
WALTER
WILL	Will holds out his hand. Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the concrete pilasters.
WILL	Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into Will's bloodshot eyes.
WALTER	Will tightens his grip. He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily. Walter watches him.
WILL
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	Steps closer to him.  Beseeching. A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings. SCREECHING into the wind. A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope of the statue.  Will hisses.
WILL
WALTER	Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope. Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial. WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck.
WILL	Walter's face, starts turning red.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER	Will looks deep into Walter's eyes.  Squeezing harder.  Pure hatred.
WILL	Their eyes, locked.  Veins, popping along Walter's temples. Lip quivering... JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance.  Will looks up. A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in. Will, looks back at Walter.  Throws him to the ground. Sickened. Walter COUGHS.  Holding his neck.  Enjoying this.
WALTER	Will shoots him a look. He pulls himself to his feet.  A little unsteady.  Takes out a handkerchief.  Dabs his forehead. He shrugs.  Walks past Will. Will turns.  Watches him walk away.  Walter hesitates.  Turns back. Will looks at him.  Back straightening. Will's stomach jumps.  Walter turns back.  Continues on. The little man in a beige windbreaker.
CHIEF NYBACK	PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk.  Will stands before him.  Signing papers.  A bottle of bourbon on the desk.  Some paper cups half filled. Will checks his watch.
WILL	Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  Toothpick in his mouth.
FRED	Nyback chuckles.
CHIEF NYBACK	Will shakes his head.
WILL
CHIEF NYBACK	Looks over at Fred picking his teeth. Will caps the pen.  Uncomfortable.  Nods towards Fred.
WILL	JUST THEN the door swings open.  They look over as ELLIE hurries in.  She smiles.  Looks tired.
ELLIE
CHIEF NYBACK
ELLIE
CHIEF NYBACK
ELLIE	An awkward beat.  Ellie walks over to Will.  Looks up. Suddenly throws her arms around him. Will holds his hands out.  Not sure what to do.  Looks down at the top of Ellie's head.
RACHEL	Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her, smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her eyes. He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING.
ELLIE
ELLIE
RACHEL
ELLIE	She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the 39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her.
RACHEL	Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle.
WALTER	Will whips around. WALTER standing there.  At the other end of the hallway. Shoulders slumped. Will shakes his head.
WILL	FLIES, bouncing against the screen door. Walter looks around.
WALTER
WILL
WALTER
WILL	Walter looks at him.
WALTER	Will takes a step forward...
WILL	Slowly reaches into his jacket... Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON.  Walter.  Looks at the gun. Inches back.
WALTER	SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.  Swings back into the doorway with a SHOTGUN... BAM!  Will's shoulder explodes with blood.
WALTER	WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.  Grabs the shotgun barrel. WALTER stumbles back.  The shotgun goes off.  BAM!  Chunks of ceiling rain down.  Walter falls to the ground.
ELLIE	Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind it.  Notices A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long dark hair...
WILL	Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will raises his voice. Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the  barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches his deaf ear.
WALTER
WILL	Walter looks at Will's 45.
WALTER	The men LOCK EYES.  Wind HOWLING through the boathouse. Killer and Detective.  Only a bullet separating them. WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun... BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut. Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed. Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering. CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below. SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down at
WILL
ELLIE	Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile.
WILL	Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers him.
ELLIE	Will looks at her bloody shoulder.
WILL	Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock.
ELLIE	Will, fading fast.
WILL
ELLIE
WILL	Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this.
ELLIE	Will nods.
WILL	A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.
ELLIE	Will shakes his head.
WILL
ELLIE	RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath.
WILL	His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him.  Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm.
ELLIE	Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her.
WILL	His eyelids, growing heavy. Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him. Will closes his eyes.
ELLIE	Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his arm. She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts hoisting him up. Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny, young woman.
WILL
ELLIE	And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
